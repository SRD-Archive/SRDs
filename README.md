SRD Collection
==============

This is a collection of Open Game License documents with all Product Identity removed from them.

The Open Game License has been really good for roleplaying games, but it's not really an open
license in the way you would normally think of them. Open games can contain provisions for 
Product Identity, which is basically closed content embedded in the open game. Product identity 
can keep people from freely distributing the work.

An Systems Resource Document (SRD) is a collection that removes the Product Identity, leaving
only the Open Content. They typically contain all the important information a game needs, but 
without art or other trade dress. They are all steak, no sizzle.


This collection contains:
-------------------------

* 3.5 SRD and 3.5 Modern SRD stored otd format and converted into docx, pdf and html formats. 
  Theese SRDs here because they are not available on the WotC website (the links are dead) and
  because the 3.5 SRD and 3.5 Modern SRD are important to gaming.

* The Mini OpenD6 SRD (based on Mini Six) is stored in Markdown format and convereted into 
  pdf, odt and html formats.

* The OpenD6 documents are being converted to Markdown. This is a work in progress.
