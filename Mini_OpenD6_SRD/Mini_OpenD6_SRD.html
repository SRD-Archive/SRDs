<h1>Mini OpenD6 SRD</h1>
<p>An SRD based on Mini Six, by Antipaladin Games. This SRD contains all the elements that are Open Content under the Open Game License.</p>
<h2>About this Book</h2>
<p>[Mini OpenD6] is a member of the OpenD6 family of games.</p>
<p>It's cinematic and flexible like its parent, but its goal is to be lighter and faster, keeping the heart of the system's mechanics but streamling the rules.</p>
<p>Pages four and five detail character creation while pages six and seven provide all the needed mechanics to play a complete game. Beyond these four pages are additional rules and options to expand your game.</p>
<p>What you won't find in this book are a lot of detailed examples, exhaustive rules to cover every possible scenario, or a large list of modifiers. Instead, we are trusting GM's, with the help of their players, to apply common sense to make the game fun for everyone. Don't slow the game down by wasting time digging for rules that aren't there. And most importantly, when the rules conflict with fun, fun wins.</p>
<h2>Definitions of Common Game Terms</h2>
<p>[Mini OpenD6] wasn't written to be read from the standpoint of the novice gamer; someone who's never seen a roleplaying game before. So, if you're lost the following definitions might prove helpful. Adventure: The story the player characters are taking part in. Rescue the princess, slay the dragon, blow up the space station, break up the car theft ring. It is like having one episode of a television show or a single movie. It might be finished in a single night or take several sessions to complete.</p>
<p>Campaign: Linked adventures that tell a larger story. For instance it could resemble a series of novels telling an epic quest or a television series where each adventure is episodic and the main common factor are the recurring characters.</p>
<p>Game Master (GM): The person in charge. Their sometimes called narrators. They run the adventure and act as impartial judge helping to keep the game moving.</p>
<p>Non-Player Character (NPC): All of the characters controlled by the Game Master. They are the heroes' allies, enemies, extras in the background, and everyone in between. If it's a character not controlled by a player, it's an NPC. These characters do not follow normal creation guidelines. They are built on the needs of the story and for the purpose the GM has in mind for them.</p>
<p>Player Character (PC): The protagonists, be they hero or antihero. These are the characters controlled by the players.</p>
<p>Round (rd or /r): Approximately ten seconds of time in the game world. How to track the speed of simple actions and combat.</p>
<p>Scene: An intense fight, a thrilling car chase, a meeting with NPC's, each extended moment of interaction with each other or others is a scene. Just like in a play or a story, when the action winds down it's the end of a scene.</p>
<p>Session: A single gathering of gamers. When you are done for the night and everyone is going home, it is the end of the session. Please respect your host by cleaning your area before you leave; it's just the nice thing to do.</p>
<p>Target Number (TN): This is the number you need to roll or higher to succeed at whatever you are attempting. General challenges are broken down into six levels of difficulty (see page 6). Combat target numbers are based on the target's defensive scores like block, dodge, etc. Sometimes you will attempt to affect another character through certain skills, such as Seduce or Intimidate, which can be resisted by the target's skill. In this case you must beat the defender's roll to succeed. The TN of a given action might be modified by the GM depending on circumstances.</p>
<h2>Dice Basics</h2>
<p>This game uses regular six sided dice. The number before the &quot;D&quot; is how many to roll, and any number after a + is how much to add to the roll. For instance 2D+2 means roll two dice and add two to the resulting total.</p>
<p>One die rolled is always the Wild Die. Use a different color die to represent this or roll the dice one at a time making the last die rolled the wild die. If the wild die results in a six, then roll again adding the six and the new result together. If a six comes up on the reroll, then you add six and reroll again! Keep doing it until the wild die lands on something other than a 6.</p>
<h2>How to Make a Character</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Distribute 12 dice between the four attributes. No attribute may have less than one nor more than four dice assigned to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute 7 dice to skills and perks. No skill may have more than two dice assigned to it at character creation.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Complications.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose gear.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Splitting Dice</h2>
<p>Skill and attribute dice may be split into &quot;pips.&quot; Each die is equal to three pips. An attribute must always have at least 1D. An attribute may have dice only (no bonus pips), +1 or +2. Going to &quot;+3&quot; advances the die code to the next largest die. Example progression is 1D, 1D+1, 1D+2, 2D, 2D+1, etc.</p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Each character has four attributes which measure basic physical and mental abilities that are common to every creature. Characters distribute 12D among the four attributes. These are normally rated on a scale of 1D to 4D, although perks may change these limits. When putting dice into each attribute you can put whole dice in each or use a mixture of whole dice and pips.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Might</strong> represents physical strength, toughness, and amount of damage dealt when striking unarmed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agility</strong> represents aim and coordination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wit</strong> represents mental creativity and intelligence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Charm</strong> represents charisma, resolve, and leadership.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Characters are further defined by skills. Players may allocate up 7D on skills to best represent the unique talents of their character. Unspent skill dice can be used to purchase Perks.</p>
<p>Skills are areas of expertise that represent focus and training. When putting dice into each skill you can put whole dice in each or use a mixture of whole dice and pips. No more than 2D may be spent in each skill during character creation. Each skill defaults to the level of the related attribute. For example, a character who has a Might of 3D has 3D in all skills under Might before allocating any dice. If two dice are added to Brawling it is recorded as 5D.</p>
<p>The following is an incomplete skill list designed to serve as an inspiration for what may be used in a game. Each game should have a tailored list of appropriate skills which might include new skills or modify examples given. For example a typical sword and sworcery game might use an expanded list of melee skills to further define its warriors while a science fiction game may lump them all into a unified skill named &quot;Melee Combat.&quot;</p>
<h3>All Genres</h3>
<ul>
<li>Might Skills: Brawling, Knife, Lift, Mace, Stamina</li>
<li>Agility Skills: Athletics, Dodge, Pickpocket, Stealth, Throwing</li>
<li>Wit Skills: History, Language, Medicine, Pick Locks, Search, Tracking</li>
<li>Charm Skills: Command, Courage, Diplomacy, Persuasion, Seduce</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Agility Skills: BFG, Drive, Pilot, Pistol, Rifle</li>
<li>Wit Skills: Computer, Navigation, Repair, Science</li>
<li>Charm Skills: Streetwise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fantasy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Might Skills: Axe, Pole Arm, Smithing, Sword</li>
<li>Agility Skills: Bow, Crossbow</li>
<li>Wit Skills: Magic</li>
<li>Charm Skills: Ride</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Combat skills are not allowed specializations.</em></p>
<h2>Skill Specializations</h2>
<p>Specializations are focused aspects of a skill. For example, Drive specializations might include Car and Motorcycle. One skill die can be spent to gain three specialty dice. Combat skills don't have specializations. Example: A character with an Agility of 3D focuses on the Running Speciality of Athletics. He spends one skill die in it, but records it as Running 6D on his character sheet. He has an Athletics of only 3D. This is the only time the 2D skill limit can be exceeded during character creation.</p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<p>During character creation, unspent skill dice may be spent to acquire Perks. The following perks are meant to serve as examples and inspiration. The cost listed next to each is in whole skill dice.</p>
<h3>Racial Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Dwarf (1): You're long lived, you can see in the dark, you receive +2 to smithing or any other craft skill, Your maximum Might is 5D but your maximum Agility is 3D.</p></li>
<li><p>Elf (2): You're long lived, you can see in the dark, you receive a +1 on all ranged attacks, Your maximum Agility is 5D but your maximum Might is only 3D.</p></li>
<li><p>Reptoid (2): You're green and scaly, this gives a +1 Armor Value. You also have claw-tipped fingers which grant you +1 damage on unarmed attacks. You might also be asexual. Sorry.</p></li>
<li><p>Robot (4): You don't eat, breathe, or sleep. You can have your memory wiped. You don't heal but you can be repaired. As long as your memory core survives you may be rebuilt if destroyed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>General Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Attractive (1): Others find the character pleasing to look at. This can help reduce suspicions or distract others depending on the given situation. Once per session the character can double one roll for any action related to their appearance. Examples include seduction, a subtle bluff or simply distracting guards.</p></li>
<li><p>Daredevil (2): Once per session you may throw caution to the wind taking extremely reckless action that may result in your own death. Your dodge, block, and parry are reduced by half however all Might rolls are doubled when resisting damage for one round.</p></li>
<li><p>Destiny (2): Characters with Destiny feel they are fated to some grand purpose. Once per game session a character may declare a failed roll is not part of their Destiny and immediately reroll to get a different result.</p></li>
<li><p>Favors (1): People owe you. Once per session you can call in one of those debts. This can take the form of information, a temporary use of equipment (borrowing a truck, plow, pump action shotgun, etc.), a place to hide someone or something for a brief time, or any similar event.</p></li>
<li><p>Lucky (2): Once per session you can declare you are feeling lucky. Double the result of your next roll.</p></li>
<li><p>Perceptive (2): The GM may reveal small clues to you that others would miss.

If nothing is revealed this perk may be used again. &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Recall (1): Any time the character chooses to recall anything he has experienced, the GM must tell him the truth in as much detail as the character would have been aware.</p></li>
<li><p>Sidekick (3): You have a boon companion willing to join in your adventures. This character only gets 10D to spend on attributes and 4D to spend on starting skills. They normally only receive 1 to 3 CP per session, but never as many as their fearless leader.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Esoteric Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Energy Blast (5): You can throw bolts of pure energy. These do 4D damage and use your Throwing skill.</p></li>
<li><p>ESP (3): You can read minds. Targets resist using their Charm vs. your Wits.</p></li>

<li><p>Regeneration (3): You heal 1 wound level/hour.</p></li>
<li><p>Sorcerer (3): You're magically sensitive. Magic spells actually work for you. See the Simple Magic System, page 10.</p></li>
<li><p>Telekinesis (3): You can move stuff with your mind. Make a Wits roll and treat it like the Lift skill. People resist using their Might.</p></li>
<li><p>X-Ray Vision (3): you can see through 1 foot of material.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>During character creation only, players may select up to two complications. These grant no additional skill dice during character creation; however, if one comes up in play the character earns one CP. Characters may not earn more than one CP per complication per session regardless of how often it comes up.</p></li>
<li><p>Age: You're either really old or really young. In addition to all the social issues caused by your age, the GM might choose to impose a penalty to an action based on your character's age. Grandpa throws a hip, a weird dude offers you candy on the street, and it's hard for either of you to seduce the supermodel at the bar. Whenever your age causes you great difficulty receive one CP.</p></li>
<li><p>Crazy: You have issues that are guaranteed to put the therapists' kids through college. Could be you're just really paranoid, or maybe just a touch too OCD. That fear of most everything could also be a problem. Then again maybe you really are Napoleon and everyone else is wrong, good luck convincing anyone else since you're a lunatic. Hastur, Hastur, Hastur! Take your pills and earn one CP any time your psychosis really gets in the way.</p></li>
<li><p>Enemies: Someone doesn't like you a at all. And they are a credible threat. Maybe they have more friends than you, maybe they're just bigger and meaner; either way you have your own personal bully. You earn the bonus CP when they complicate your life.</p></li>
<li><p>Gremlins: You have a special touch. Specifically the kind that breaks machines. You're no good with engines, electronics, magical gizmos, or any other trinket. If it's a device, you can't trust it. Earn one CP whenever the GM takes his one free shot on you this way.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal Code: You live by a creed and you will not cross that line. Maybe you won't fight an unarmed opponent and always make sure they know its coming or maybe you never tell a lie. No matter how you define it, your code has to mean something. Some caped crusaders won't kill, paladins won't resort to deception, and sometimes there is even honor among thieves. Earn one CP whenever your code complicates you or friends' success.</p></li>
<li><p>Skeletons in the Closet: You've been a naughty boy. Maybe you're a closet smoker. Maybe those hookers buried themselves. Maybe that enemy uniform in the closet really isn't yours. Maybe the bank really meant to let you take all that money out that day. Whatever, the universe doesn't judge. You earn the bonus CP whenever your past comes back to haunt you.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlucky in Love: Things just don't work out for some guys. Your love interest is always dying, being kidnapped, betraying you, or even worse dumping you. You earn bonus CP when your love life falls apart in a meaningful way.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlucky in Money: You have a hard time holding onto money. You earn the bonus CP when you lose a significant amount of cash through your own foolishness or bad luck and have nothing to show for it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Gear</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Some games may assume the character has the trappings of a middle class lifestyle, while others may take place in a world of fantasy where only those items in your pack mean the difference between life and death.</p></li>
<li><p>Characters might start with one piece of related gear for each skill they allocated dice to during character creation. For example a pistol for the Pistols skill, a medic bag for Medicine, etc. For anything else, beg the GM.</p></li>

<h1>The Game Mechanics</h1>
<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>A character may move up to 15 feet as a free action or move 30 feet at the cost of one action. If a character wishes to run faster he rolls his Athletics skill and adds it to his movement. If the only action taken in a round is running, his total move is doubled.</p>
<h2>General (non-combat) Challenges</h2>
<p>Characters roll the appropriate attribute plus skill against a set target number based on the task attempted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Very Easy: 2 to5</li>
<li>Easy: 6 to 10</li>
<li>Moderate: 11 to 15</li>
<li>Difficult: 16 to 20</li>
<li>Very Difficult: 21 to 30</li>
<li>Heroic: 31+</li>
</ul>
<p>Very Easy: Nearly everyone can do it. These checks should only be made if a success is critical to the scenario at hand.</p>
<p>Easy: Characters will seldom have trouble with these tasks, but an untrained individual may find them challenging.</p>
<p>Moderate: Average character have a reasonable chance of failing at this level. Consistent success often requires training in the skill or a high level of natural ability.</p>
<p>Difficult: Tasks at this level are truly challenging. To succeed a character needs to be well skilled or very lucky.</p>
<p>Very Difficult: Challenges of this level fall into the domain of masters in the skill being used; few others will succeed at them.</p>
<p>Heroic: These challenges are almost impossible. Only the very lucky or true masters can consistently succeed at them.</p>
<h2>Order of Actions in a Round</h2>
<p>(a round is considered to be approximately 10 seconds)</p>
<ol>
<li>Declare all actions planned for the round.</li>
<li>Determine order of Initiative by rolling Agility for each character. Highest goes first.</li>
<li>Characters make rolls for all actions they are attempting. The target may get an opportunity to resist or avoid the action.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Multiple Actions</h2>
<p>Characters may attempt to do more than one thing on a turn by withholding one die from every action they attempt for each action beyond the first. For instance, if a character tries to shoot twice, he will subtract one die from each attempt.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>At the end of each session the GM awards each character a number of character points. The number of points given per session typically varies from 3 to 7 depending on drama, danger, success, and fun!</p>
<h2>Spending Character Points (CP)</h2>
<p>Any skill may be increased one pip by spending a number of CPs equal to its current number of dice. No skill may be increased more than one pip per session. Skill specializations cost only half as much to raise, rounding up.</p>
<p>Character points are also used to improve attributes. This costs 10 times the number of dice a character has in the attribute to raise it one pip. All skills under this attribute also improve by one pip. For example, if a character had a Wit of 3D+1 and wanted to improve it to 3D+2 it would cost 30 CP.</p>
<h2>Hero Points</h2>
<p>Characters start with 1 hero point and may spend it before any roll. Hero Points provide a variety of options, but once spent the point is lost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaining a +6 to any single roll (up to 3 points may be used at one time when using this effect).</li>
<li>Just a flesh wound. Once per combat a hero point can be used to reduce the severity of a character's wounds one level.</li>
<li>Make a small change to their location (locating an unlocked window, finding a can of WD40 and a roll of duct tape, etc.)</li>
<li>&quot;Buy&quot; a clue. Sometimes players are at a lost or think they might have missed something. This gives them the option to find that detail that they would have otherwise missed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hero Points are earned through superior play and given as an incentive by the GM to help encourage the style of action desired in a game. If playing a gritty western and the character makes a clever quip using the &quot;in-game&quot; jargon that makes everyone laugh without disrupting play that may be worth a Hero Point. Unless completely against the nature of the game played, extremely clever ideas and grand heroic deeds should always be rewarded.</p>
<h2>Scaling</h2>
<p>Not all objects are on the same scale. Humans and horses may be close enough to be equals, but humans and dragons aren't. When dealing damage to a smaller scaled target or resisting damage inflicted by it, the larger adds the difference in modifiers to their die rolls or static defenses. Smaller scaled targets attempting to dodge attacks from or actually attempting to attack a larger scaled opponent add the difference to their dodge and attack rolls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Character, Animals: None</li>
<li>Air Cycle, Car, Little Dragon, Wagon: +2D /+6 to Dodge &amp; Soak</li>
<li>Big Dragon, Galley, Mecha, Tank: +4D/+12 to Dodge &amp; Soak</li>
<li>Fighter, Lt. Transport, Heavy Mecha: +6D/+18 to Dodge &amp; Soak</li>
<li>Capital Ship, Elder God, Space Station: +12D/+36 to Dodge &amp; Soak</li>
<li>Mega Space Station, Planets: +24D/+72 to Dodge &amp; Soak</li>
</ul>
<h2>Healing</h2>
<p>Natural Healing: If a wounded character rests he is allowed a Might check and if successful heals a wound level. The frequency of the check depends on the severity of the character's wounds.</p>
<p>Assisted Healing: Characters with the Medicine skill can attempt to help others heal more quickly. A skill check may be made once per day for each patient treated. On a successful roll, the patient heals one wound level.</p>
<p><em>Wound Level: Frequency (N. Healing): Might Difficulty: Assisted Healing Difficulty</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Stunned: 1 minute: automatic: Easy</li>
<li>Wounded: 3 days: 6: Moderate</li>
<li>Severely Wounded: 3 days: 6: Moderate</li>
<li>Incapacitated: 2 weeks: 8: Difficult</li>
<li>Mortally Wounded: 5 weeks: 9: Very Difficult</li>
</ul>
<h1>Two Types of Combat</h1>
<p>Why two rules?</p>
<p>Fast Static Combat is the preferred method of combat resolution. While players familiar with OpenD6 may be more comfortable with Traditional OpenD6 Combat.</p>
<p>Fast Static Combat reduces the number of die rolls without significantly altering the results compared to Traditional OpenD6 Combat.</p>
<p>[Mini OpenD6] supports both flavors so you can easily use whichever method you prefer.</p>
<h2>Fast Static Combat</h2>
<h3>Attacking a Target</h3>
<p>The Target Number, or TN, is the number needed to successfully hit the target. The base target number on an attack is based on the target's static defense score.</p>
<p>Range: Add the range modifier to the Dodge score in all cases (Point Blank/ Hand-to-Hand -5, Medium +5, Long +10). See the sample gear list for ranges.</p>
<p>Cover: If the target is behind at least 50% cover, add +5 to the Target Number. Add +10 for 75% cover. It's impossible to hit a target behind 100% cover. Darkness can also be considered as cover at the GM's whim.</p>
<h3>Static Defenses</h3>
<p>In the simplified combat system characters precalculate their Dodge, Block, and Parry prior to the game. This static number become's the attacker's TN modified as noted above. To calculate each simply multiply the number of dice a character has in the relevant skill by 3 and add any pips to the total. Then note it down on the character sheet. For example, Sir Baelen has a Sword skill of 5D+1. His static Parry score would become 16 ((5 x 3)+1).</p>
<ul>
<li>Block = (Brawling skill dice x 3) + pips.</li>
<li>Dodge = (Dodge skill dice x 3) + pips.</li>
<li>Parry = (Weapon skill dice x 3) + pips.</li>
<li>Soak = (Might attribute dice x 3) + pips plus armor value + any magical, super-tech, or other AV bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full Dodge: If the character does nothing except dodge until his next turn they will add 10 to their Dodge score, and apply range and cover as usual. This result is useful against any number of attacks.</p>
<h3>Resisting Damage</h3>
<p>When a target has been hit, the attacker rolls damage and the target's Soak score is subtracted from the damage. The player or GM then checks the Wound Level chart below to see how badly the target was wounded.</p>
<h2>Traditional OpenD6 Combat</h2>
<h3>Attacking a Target</h3>
<p>The Target Number, or TN, is the number needed to successfully hit the target. The base target number on an attack is 10. This is modified by range, by cover, by block, by parry, or by dodging (see below.)</p>
<p>Range: The ranged attack modifier applies to the base TN or defender's Dodge roll (Point Blank/ Hand-to-Hand -5, Medium +5, Long +10). See the sample gear list for ranges.</p>
<p>Cover: If the target is behind at least 50% cover, add +5 to the TN. Add +10 for 75% cover. It's impossible to hit a target behind 100% cover. Darkness can also be considered as cover at the GM's whim.</p>
<h3>Defensive Options</h3>
<p>The defender may optionally choose to Dodge, Block, or Parry when attacked, however if the defense was not stated when the character first declared their actions for the turn they suffer an additional -1D penalty until their next turn.</p>
<p>Block/Parry: When attacked by a brawling or melee weapon, the defender may choose to Block or Parry, both incur a reflex penalty (see below). The defender rolls his brawling skill, or weapon skill if armed, and this becomes the TN the attacker must score to hit the character. The result of this roll is used even if it is less than what the TN would have been had the defender not blocked! If a weapon parry's a brawling attack the attacker takes the damage of the weapon!</p>
<p>Reflexive Dodge: The character tries to get out of the way of the attack. Roll the defender's dodge skill and use that instead of any other TN, (Range and Cover still apply.) The defender suffers a penalty of -1D to all actions until their next turn.</p>
<p>Full Dodge: The character does nothing except dodge until his next turn. Roll dodge, add 10, and apply range and cover as usual. This result is useful against any number of attacks.</p>
<h3>Resisting Damage</h3>
<p>When a target has been hit, the attacker rolls damage while the target rolls their Might adding any armor value bonuses. The total of the target's Might roll is subtracted from the attacker’s damage total. The player or GM then checks the Wound Level chart to see how badly the target was wounded.</p>
<h2>Wound Levels</h2>
<p><em>Wound Level: Dmg Total ≥ Res Total by:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Unharmed: 0 or less</li>
<li>Stunned: 1--3</li>
<li>Wounded: 4--8</li>
<li>Severely Wounded: 4--8 (Note: A character is Severely Wounded if the result is between 4 and 8 and he already has the Wounded level.</li>
<li>Incapacitated: 9 --12</li>
<li>Mortally Wounded: 13 -- 15</li>
<li>Dead: 16+</li>
<li>Note: Any additional damage less than or equal to the character's current level moves him up by one level.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wound Level Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stunned: -1D for all remaining actions this round and next round.</li>
<li>Wounded: -1D to all actions until healed.</li>
<li>Severely Wounded: -2D on all actions until healed.</li>
<li>Incapacitated: As a free action before losing consciousness, the character may try to stay up with a Moderate (15) stamina roll. If successful, he may continue to act, but with a -3D penalty. If he fails, he is knocked out for 10D minutes.</li>
<li>Mortally Wounded: The character is near death and knocked unconscious with no chance to keep up. Roll the character's Might each round, the character finally dies if the roll is less than the number of minutes he's been at this level.</li>
<li>Dead: The character has perished.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Vehicles</h1>
<p>All vehicles from ancient chariots to futuristic starships are defined by a common set of statistics. The following stats help the GM and players quickly resolve all actions related to vehicles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skill: What skill is used to drive/pilot it.</li>
<li>Scale: The size of the vehicle.</li>
<li>Body: Used to resist damage.</li>
<li>Maneuverability (MNV): How easy it is to handle. This gives a bonus on drive and pilot skill rolls.</li>
<li>Move: How fast it can travel.</li>
<li>Crew: The number needed to successfully operate the vehicle.</li>
<li>Passengers (Psg): Non-crew capacity.</li>
<li>Weapons: Any armaments mounted on the vehicle.</li>
<li>Cargo: How much stuff it can carry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vehicle Combat</h2>
<p>Some vehicles have weapons. Unless specified in their descriptions they are considered to be the same scale as the vehicle. Attacks are resolved in the same manner as character vs. character combat with the only difference being the character uses their drive/pilot skill in place of dodge to avoid being hit. If the hit was successful the character would roll the vehicle's Body to resist the damage and consult the following chart to determine how severe the damage is:</p>
<p><em>Damage Rolled: Effect</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Damage Roll ≥ Body Roll: Temporary Effect (one round)</li>
<li>Damage Roll ≥ 2 x Body Roll Permanent Effect (repair required)</li>
<li>Damage Roll ≥ 3 x Body Roll: Permanent Effect (part destroyed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the severity of the damage is determined the GM may roll randomly on the the following chart or use common sense to determine which part is damaged.</p>
<p><em>Roll 1D: Effect</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1: Lose 1D from Maneuverability</li>
<li>2 to 3: Random System Damaged</li>
<li>4 to 6: Structural Damage</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effects of Damage</h3>
<p>Maneuverability: Each time this is affected the vehicle loses 1D. This can go negative becoming a penalty to the driver's skill roll.</p>
<p>System Damaged: Randomly select a vehicle's system and it either becomes broken or loses 1D from its rating (if applicable). Examples include communications/radio, sensors, shielding, sail, rigging, armor, etc.</p>
<p>Structural Damage: The vehicle receives one wound level. Treat these like character wound levels. Mortally wounded vehicles stop running and Dead vehicles are considered destroyed.</p>
<h3>Ramming</h3>
<p>When vehicles are at short range, a pursuer may try to ram. To successfully ram the pilot needs to roll higher than the target's Pilot skill check. If successful both vehicles take damage equal to to the body of attacking plus relative move dice.</p>
<h3>Multiple Weapons on Vehicles</h3>
<p>When vehicles have more than one weapon of a single type, they can be fired as a single salvo. This requires a successful Command skill roll with the difficulty based on the number of guns being combined. Each doubling of the number of weapons combined increases the damage by one pip.</p>
<h2>Chases</h2>
<p>When attempting to overtake or outrun an opponent the GM determines what range you are at (Short/Medium/Long). Each turn each vehicle makes a drive/pilot check, with the vehicle's Move dice granting a bonus. The higher roll either closes or increases the distance 1 range as desired. If reduced below Short you catch up, if increased beyond long you escape.</p>
<h2>Repairing Vehicles</h2>
<p>Characters may repair vehicles using their skills. The difficulty and cost is determined on the following chart. The cost is based on the price of a new vehicle.</p>
<p><em>Dice Lost: Difficulty: Cost: Time Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1D: Easy: 10%: 1 hour</li>
<li>2D: Moderate: 15%: 4 hours</li>
<li>3D+: Difficult: 20%: 1 day</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vehicle Movement</h2>
<p>Move dice represent relative speed between vehicles of similar types. Vehicles are divided into four broad categeries including Primitive Craft/Muscle Powered, Motorized Ground and Water Craft, Aircraft, and Spacecraft. If vehicles of different categories must compare speeds, such as a fighter chasing a tank, the faster vehicle is granted bonus move dice based on the difference in speed factors in the following chart:</p>
<p><em>Speed Factor: Modifier</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Primitive Craft / Muscle Powered: 0D</li>
<li>Motorized Ground / Water Craft: 2D</li>
<li>Aircraft: 5D</li>
<li>Spacecraft: 10D</li>
</ul>
<h2>Weapon Ranges in Space</h2>
<p>Space is big and empty. Guns shoot great distances and ships are extremely fast. The ranges given are abstract units that are defined by the needs of the individual game.</p>
<h2>Vehicle Costs</h2>
<ul>
<li>$ Trivial cost.</li>
<li>$$ Affordable to most.</li>
<li>$$$ Affordable to the very wealthy, governments, and corps.</li>
<li>$$$$ Only the richest individuals, most governments.</li>
<li>$$$$$ Only large governments and megacorps can purchase.</li>
<li>$$$$$$ World governments and star empires only.</li>

<h1>The Simple Magic System</h1>
<p>Call it Ki, Chi, Sorcery, Latent Psi, etc; it's all just different flavors of magic. Magic let's you break the rules of the universe in creative ways. Some games let you use flashy spells; others require you to use more subtle effects. Speak with your GM about the limits of magic in his game.</p>
<h2>Access to Magic</h2>
<p>In some games, none may use magic, in others everyone can. The most common option is a middle ground that requires the character to start the game with the Sorcerer esoteric perk.</p>
<h2>Casting Spells</h2>
<p>All spells have a target number (TN) listed in their description. Sorcerers roll Magic to determine success. Only one spell may be cast per turn. Success on the roll mean the spell is cast, see each spell description for the exact effect achieved. On a failed roll, the Sorcerer suffers a -1D penalty to their Magic skill. Further failures increase the penalty. One hour of rest with no interruption removes all penalties.</p>
<h2>Spells Requiring Multiple Actions</h2>
<p>Some spells require additional actions to be taken after casting. For example, thrown spells require the Sorcerer to cast the spell and then hit the target by making a Throw skill check. The Sorcerer may wait until the next turn to throw the spell or they may opt to suffer the penalty for multiple actions and do them all in one turn.</p>
<h2>Concentration (CONC)</h2>
<p>Some spells require the Sorcerer to maintain concentration for the spell to remain in effect. Each spell maintained counts as one action.</p>
<h2>Beginning Spells &amp; Learning More</h2>
<p>The character knows two spells for each die allocated to Magic at character creation. Learning a new spell costs 2 CP.</p>
<h2>Magic Perks</h2>
<p>Characters that are able to learn the Magic skill may also purchase the following Perks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Familiar (1): The character has an imp for a companion. The familiar can fly at a rate of 60 ft each turn, can talk, and has 1D in each attribute. He also has 3D in skills. He can't cast spells, but he can turn into a black cat or other small animal at will.</p></li>
<li><p>Totem Spirit (1): The character has a spiritual advisor that speaks to him in his dreams or visions. This spirit will likely have a somewhat alien perspective on matters, and certainly won't always just tell the character everything he knows. Totem Spirits employ riddles, puzzles, and enjoy sending the character off on ridiculous quests; but they also have insight and know things man was never meant to know.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Magic Complications</h2>
<p>The GM may also allow special complications for magic capable characters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Demonic Pact: The character has allied himself with a demon. It tends to impress all the wrong people. You earn bonus CP any time this complicates your life.</p></li>
<li><p>White Wizard: You can't harm anyone with your magic. Ever. Earn 1 bonus CP every session.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sorcerer's Tools</h2>
<p>Some special enchanted items are of use only to those capable of using spells. Activating the bonus granted by an item does not count as an action. When found a sorcerer must attune the item before he can use it. This requires the passing of three days while keeping the item close.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Cloak grants +2D to the Magic skill test required to use the Fly and Teleport spells.</p></li>
<li><p>The Crystal Ball grants +3D to the Magic skill test required to use the Clairvoyance and Divination spells.</p></li>
<li><p>The Magic Wand grants +1D to any Magic skill test when used for the spell the wand was designed for.</p></li>
<li><p>The Spell Staff grants +1D to Magic once each day.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Making Sorcerer's Tools</h2>
<p>Sorcerers may construct their own tools; this requires time, money, and CP. During the construction of the item the sorcerer must work for twelve hours each day. If any days are skipped all effort is lost. At the end of the process he rolls a Magic check vs. the TN listed below. If he fails all effort and money is wasted but no CP were spent.</p>
<p><em>Item: Cost: Time: CP: TN</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Cloak: $$$: 4 weeks: 20: 30</li>
<li>Crystal Ball: $$$$: 8 weeks: 30: 35</li>
<li>Magic Wand: $$: 2 weeks: 10: 25</li>
<li>Spell Staff: $$$: 4 weeks: 15: 30</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spell Books</h2>
<p>When learning new spells accessing another sorcerer's spell book reduces the cost to 1 CP for any spell it contains. A spell can contain up to six spells. Sorcerers normally create when they are learning new spells. Afterwards they no longer need the spell book. Some keep them for apprentices, sentimental value, or fear of somehow forgetting the spells they have mastered. Others keep their books in case then need to sell them for money.</p>

Uncontrolled elementals will attack everyone, including the conjurer.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Death Spell</h3>
<p>If successfully cast, the Sorcerer rolls his Magic skill without his Wit attribute for damage. The target resists using only Might. For example, Melkot casts Death Spell on Tamore. Melkot has a Wit of 4D and 10D in Magic. Melkot would roll 6D for damage (10D -- 4D) and Tamore would resist with his Might.</p>
<ul>

<li>Range: 30 feet</li>
<li>Resisted: Special</li>
</ul>

<li>Range: 30 feet</li>
<li>Resisted: None</li>
</ul>
<h3>Divination</h3>
<p>The Sorcerer can attempt to see the future or the past. The immediate future or past normally has a TN of 25 while more distant events have a higher TN. For instance, seeing a year into the future may have a TN of 45 while a year into the past is only 35. If attempting to divine about specific objects or people that are not present, the difficulty goes up by 10 or more depending on closeness of relationship to the Sorcerer.</p>
<ul>
<li>TN: Special</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Range: Self</li>
<li>Resisted: None</li>
</ul>
<h3>Earthquake</h3>

<li>Resisted: None</li>
</ul>

<li>TN: 15 + Resist Roll</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Range: 50 feet</li>
<li>Resisted: Charm</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fly</h3>
<p>While maintained the Sorcerer can fly at a rate of 90 feet per round. If the spell ends before landing the character will float to the ground. The character may hover and carry up to his own weight aloft. If the character only wishes to levitate vertically the TN of the spell is 15.</p>
<ul>
<li>TN: 23 (or 15)</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Range: 100 feet</li>
<li>Range: Self</li>
</ul>
<h3>Growth</h3>
<p>The caster grows. Each scale increase adds +10 to the TN. For example, for a human sorcerer to grow to the size of a dragon would require 2 scale increases making the TN 43.</p>
<ul>
<li>TN: 23 + Special</li>
<li>Duration: 10 Rounds</li>
<li>Range: Self</li>
<li>Resisted: None</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hasten</h3>
<p>Targets have their multiple action penalty reduced by 1D. The effects of multiple Hasten spells don't stack.</p>
<ul>
<li>TN: 23</li>
<li>Duration: 5 rounds</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Resisted: None</li>
</ul>
<h3>Heal</h3>
<p>The Sorcerer must concentrate for 6 turns before casting this spell. The TN is 15 when attempting to heal anyone wounded or severely wounded, 19 for incapacitated characters, and 23 for the mortally wounded. Success reduces the wound level by one. If heal is used more than once per day on a target, the target number of additional castings increases by +10.</p>
<ul>
<li>TN: Special</li>
<li>Duration: Instant</li>
<li>Range: Touch</li>
<li>Resisted: None</li>
</ul>
<h3>Illusions</h3>
<p>Illusions create false perceptions in the minds of the effected. The target number is 15 plus 2 per person after the first targeted plus their individual Resist Roll. Compare results for each person individually to see if they are affected. GMs may wish to roll for the highest Resist first and if they fail consider all to have failed.</p>
<ul>
<li>TN: Special + Resist Roll</li>
<li>Duration: Concentration</li>
<li>Range: 50 foot radius</li>
<li>Resisted: Wit</li>

<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>
<li>Range: 100 feet</li>
<li>Resisted: None</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lightning Bolt</h3>
<p>The caster throws lightning. This requires the use of the Throw skill. If the caster attempts to throw it the same round it is cast the multiple action penalty applies to both the casting and throwing of the spell. The caster may also choose to throw the lightning the round after casting to avoid the penalty. However if he waits any longer the effect dissipates. Targets may make a Dodge roll to avoid being hit. A successful hit inflicts 5D damage. Armor does not protect against Lightning.</p>
<ul>
<li>TN: 23</li>
<li>Duration: Instant</li>
<li>Range: 150 feet</li>
<li>Resisted: None</li>
</ul>

<li>Range: 100 feet</li>
<li>Resisted: Might</li>
</ul>
<h3>Possession</h3>

Th e sorcerer may make the possessed being take any physical action it is capable of, but can’t make it use Magic or any Perk.

<ul>
<li>TN: 19</li>
<li>Duration: 1 hour</li>

<h1>Sample Characters by Genre</h1>
<p>The characters presented below are sometimes less powerful than starting player characters, sometimes more. Here is a scale to help determine potency:</p>
<p>! Not a threat usually. !! Minor threat only in a group. !!! Credible threat. !!!! Watch out, Heroes! !!!!! Bold or foolish to even try.</p>
<p>Skills listed in each entry include the base attribute, but effects of character scale haven't been prefigured. All attributes, skills, and gear are just for typical or average characters. Superior and inferior individuals exist of every type.</p>
<p>Static defenses are precalculated with any skills listed. Soak is listed as X(Y) where X is the base soak value and Y includes any armor or other bonus listed. If a bonus die is granted to Brawling, Dodge, or melee skills simply add 3 per die to the static score. While listed by genre type, these are only rough guidelines.</p>
<p>If you need a bloodthirsty alien race for a space opera campaign, take the orc template, change its name to Xargon, arm them with laser rifles and a 4D skill with them. Likewise, if you need a few brooding emo vampires, take the vampire template as written, give him hair product, eye make-up, a trendy wardrobe, a tattoo, and an attitude.</p>

<h1>Optional Rules</h1>
<p>By its nature [Mini OpenD6] is highly customizable. With just a few choices you can change it from a light hearted game of keystone cops to gritty survival horror. While it is always good to remember that all rules are optional when preparing for the game the following ideas are meant to help give you further inspiration in adjusting the game to best fit your needs. In the end the only hard and fast rule is to play the game the way your group enjoys.</p>
<h2>Renaming Attributes</h2>
<p>By changing attribute names GMs can influence how a game feels. For Swashbuckling games the four attributes could be called Power, Grace, Reason, and Poise. If set in 70's Grindhouse they could transform into Muscles, Moves, Brains, and Cool.</p>
<h2>Varying the Number of Attribute Dice</h2>
<p>Default starting player characters have 12 dice to spend on attributes. This makes them heroic in nature and generally competent in everything. By changing the number of attribute dice the feel of play is altered. The following chart provides guidelines for total attribute dice to use based on the power scale of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 dice = The common man.</li>
<li>9 dice = Experienced. Well trained in their specialty.</li>
<li>10 dice = Competent. A cut above John Q Public.</li>
<li>11 dice = Veteran. Easily stands out from the rest.</li>
<li>12 dice = Heroic. The default level of play.</li>
<li>13 dice = World Class. Has an edge in most everything.</li>
<li>14+ dice = Legendary characters. Herculean in nature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expanded Number of Attributes</h2>
<p>The default four attributes cover most situations a character might come across. This also makes them fairly broad. If a greater division is desired extra attributes can be added. Examples include Perception (separated from Wit), Mechanical (from Agility and Wit), Courage (from Charm) and Toughness (from Might).</p>
<h3>Beginning Attribute Dice</h3>
<p>When adding extra attributes each player receives three additional dice per attribute added for heroic level games. If 6 attributes are used in place of 4, players would divide 18D among them.</p>
<h3>Effects on Skills</h3>
<p>If your GM has increased the number of attributes he will provide you with a breakdown of where each skill now defaults.</p>
<h2>Increasing the Attribute Range</h2>
<p>Characters are normally limited to 4D in an attribute unless a perk modifies this. Some GMs may wish to offer an upper maximum of 5D, 6D, or higher. When using this option the dice are spent as normal. Other GMs may not be so comfortable with such casually powerful characters. They may choose a more costly option instead.</p>
<h2>Higher Attributes at a Price</h2>
<p>Under this rule characters can select attributes above 4D or whatever limits the GM sets, but they cost twice as much as normal beyond that limit. For example, a GM declares attributes are purchased as normal up to 4D but he allows higher attributes at a price up to 5D. A character who spends 6D in Might would record 5D as their Might attribute. Another character wants an Agility of 4D+2. This would cost him 5D+1 attribute dice.</p>
<h2>No Attributes</h2>
<p>All skills default to a base 2D and at character creation players receive 16D to spend on skills. Up to 4D can be spent in any one skill. For example, if playing a Gunslinger, the player may spend 4D in Pistols, 1D in Rifles, 3D in Toughness (to resist damage) 4D in Dodge, 3D in Brawl, and 1D in Gamble; recording it like this:</p>
<p>Gunslinger: 5D Brawl, 6D Dodge, 3D Gamble, 6D Pistols, 3D Rifles, 5D Toughness.</p>
<h2>Adding Paranormal Abilities</h2>
<p>Paranormal Abilities are special for two reasons; first it is possible to have 0D in them, representing mundane characters. The second is that those who do have them gain access to restricted powers. For example in a vampire game characters might use Blood Potency, Dominate, Foretelling, Spirit, and Transformation; during character creation the player could spend attribute dice to gain some access to one or more them.</p>
<p>No extra attribute dice are given for Paranormal Abilities at character creation. This reduces a character's mundane attributes but the powers granted by their paranormal gifts make up for it. GMs will define which, if any, are used in their games and how they work in the setting.</p>
<p>Characters who begin with 0D in a Paranormal Ability may be allowed to purchase it later with GM permission. We suggest the first die cost 10 or 20 CP.</p>
<h3>Quasi Skills</h3>
<p>These are purchased as attributes at character creation but afterwards are raised with CP like skills and don't have any skills under them. GM's might increase the cost to raise these skills based on a character's access to teachers or suitable training material. For example, a game focused on Angels might include the quasi skills of Spiritual, Etheric, and Corporeal. A starting character may have Spiritual 2D Etheric 1D, and Corporeal 0D. Later, studying under one of his elder's the angel would spend 2 CP to improve Spiritual to 2D+1.</p>
<h3>Paranormal Attributes with Skills</h3>
<p>These are the same as any other attributes except that characters can have 0D in the attribute and no access to their related skills. In a game focused on werewolf naturists the GM might create the attributes Elemental and Spiritual. Under the Elemental attribute the skills may be Air, Earth, Fire, and Water; while Spiritual includes Communing, Summoning, and Channeling.</p>
<h2>Varying Starting Skill Dice</h2>
<p>Default starting player characters receive 7 dice to spend on skills and perks and can't spend more than 2D on any one skill. This represents fledgling heroic level characters. The GM might grant them additional dice for a more difficult campaign. He may also allow them to spend more than 2D in any single skill. The number of dice and maximum allocations should be weighed carefully to fit the desires of the campaign.</p>
<h2>High Skills Rolls Increasing Damage</h2>
<p>When using this rule damage is boosted by 1 point for every 5 points you exceeded the target number to hit. If a warrior needed to beat a Parry of 14 and rolled a 26 on his attack, this would increase the damage by +2 since the target was beaten by 12. For increased deadliness, simply reduce the number needed to exceed the roll by to increase damage. If every 3 points of success translates to 1 point of damage skilled characters are deadly.</p>
<h2>Independent Skills</h2>
<p>Skills normally always default to one particular attribute, for example Sword always defaults to Might. In a more freewheeling campaign skills may be detached from attributes allowing more fluid definition of how their used. When skills are purchased they don't get the benefit of any default attribute. If using a broad skill list then the typical 7D may be used. If opting for many more narrowly focused skills then 12D to 18D may be appropriate.</p>
<p>It is suggested that raising skills with CP should cost double the normal price for skill advancement. This sounds more costly but isn't because the skills start so much lower.</p>
<p>A sample knight might look like this:</p>
<h3>Knight</h3>
<ul>
<li>Might 4D</li>
<li>Agility 3D</li>
<li>Wit 2D</li>
<li>Charm 3D</li>
<li>Skills: Dodge 1D, History 1D, Ride 2D, Seduce 1D, Sword 2D</li>
</ul>
<p>When attacking an enemy our knight will typically roll Might + Sword for a total of 6D. Later when attempting to purchase a quality sword in the market the knight would roll his Wit + Sword for a total of 4D. That evening while practicing his swordsmanship a group of ladies watches from afar. To impress them he rolls his Charm + Sword for a total of 5D.</p>
<h2>Rolling Limit</h2>
<p>Some dislike rolling large numbers of dice, feeling the math slows down the game. GMs may impose a limit on the number of dice rolled at any time. We suggest the cut-off be 5 dice. If a character has more than 5D on a roll, each die beyond the rolling limit is converted to a +3 bonus. For example a GM has imposed a 5D rolling limit at his table. A character with 7D+1 in Rifle shoots at bad guy. He rolls 5 dice and adds 7 to the result.</p>
<h2>Halfway There</h2>
<p>To help speed up the game, if the number of skill dice in any skill is equal to half the Target Number, the GM may consider it an automatic success.</p>
<h2>Traditional OpenD6 Hero Points</h2>
<p>In traditional OpenD6, Hero Points work differently. Instead of giving a static +6 to a roll and allowing for other options such as Flesh Wounds, etc. they double the number of dice on any single roll. For example a spy has 4D+1 in Security and must disable a bomb. To help ensure success the player spends 1 HP doubling his roll to 8D+2.</p>
<h2>Traditional OpenD6 Character Points</h2>
<p>In traditional OpenD6 Character Points may be spent to improve individual rolls during play. These points can be spent after the character has rolled but only before the GM has let the player know if the roll was successful. Each CP spent grants additional Wild Die to the roll. The GM may impose a limit on how many CP may be used on a single roll in his game. Players cannot spend character points to improve a roll that they also spent a Hero Point on.</p>
<h2>Buying New Perks</h2>
<p>If you have a good reason and the GM agrees you may buy a perk after play has begun for 10 CP times the standard cost. Some perks make no sense; you don't wake up an elf.</p>
<h2>Buying Off Complications</h2>
<p>To get rid of a complication the GM will impose a price of at least 20 CP if he allows it at all and you need a really good story, possibly even a quest or adventure to justify it. Alternatively, as the story progresses player and GM might agree to exchange old complications for new one.</p>
<h2>Body Points (alternative to Wound Levels)</h2>
<p>In place of using Wound Levels GMs may elect to use Body Points (BP). Under this variant, players roll their character's Might and add this to 20. This is the amount of damage they can take before death. If less variability is desired the GM may give 4 BP per die in Might instead.</p>
<h3>Damage Resistance Under Fast Static Combat</h3>
<p>Under this combat system, the Static Soak is replaced with Static Damage Resistance (DR). Static Damage Resistance is equal to the Armor Value of the target. As a rule of thumb any creature or stock character with no number in parenthesis next to their Soak has a Damage Resistance of 0; those that do subtract their Soak from the number in parenthesis and use the difference. The GM might define special abilities that also grant a bonus to this total. Hero points can be spent to gain a +6 bonus to DR.</p>
<h3>Damage Resistance Traditional OpenD6 Combat</h3>
<p>The damage resistance total equals a roll of the target character's die codes from armor or Special Abilities. Hero points can be spent to gain a +6 bonus to DR.</p>
<h3>Taking Damage Under Both Systems</h3>
<p>When a character is hit they subtract their DR from the damage total. If the remaining total is one or more it is subtracted from the character's current BP total. If reduced to 0 or fewer BP, the character is dead.</p>
<h2>Natural Healing</h2>
<p>To heal, the character needs complete rest. After resting one full day a Might check is made and the level of success achieved determines how many BP are recovered. Healing: BP are recovered as follows:</p>
<p><em>Healing Difficulty: BP Recovered</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Very Easy: 2</li>
<li>Easy: 1D</li>
<li>Moderate: 2D</li>
<li>Difficult: 3D</li>
<li>Very Difficult: 4D</li>
<li>Heroic: 5D</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assisted Healing (Medicine)</h2>
<p>Once per day a character can assist another by making a Medicine skill check. The number of BP healed is based on the level of success achieved and uses the same chart as the character's Might check.</p>
<p>Traditional OpenD6 Might Damage In traditional OpenD6 the base amount of damage dealt in unarmed and melee combat is calculated differently. Characters use half their dice in Lift skill ignoring pips and rounding down the result. For example, a character with a Lift skill of 3D+2 would deal 1D damage in unarmed combat or 1D+weapon damage when using a melee weapon.</p>
<h2>Adjusting Deadliness</h2>
<p>By increasing or decreasing the base number of BP the lethality of the game is changed. For extremely cinematic games the GM may allow players to double the Might total or roll twice and take the higher number.</p>
<h1>Making the Game Your Own</h1>
<p>Its possible to sit down and play a game with [Mini OpenD6] on the fly using just what has been provided. However, the game is much more enjoyable when some advance thought is put into the world the characters will adventure in. For repeated campaign style play this is practically a requirement.</p>
<h2>Developing Your Own Setting</h2>
<p>(or stealing from the Great Ones)</p>
<p>The first thing you need is an idea. If you don't already have one try asking your players what they want to do. Between talking with them and your own dreams one is likely to form. It might be based off a comic book, a show on TV, a recent hit movie, or any other source of mass media. Or it might be invented whole cloth from your imagination. Before we get all touchy feely and start sharing emotions let's crawl out of your head and get on to the next step.</p>
<p>Now that you have a golden gem of an idea, you need to write down a short description. Imagine that your audience has never heard of anything similar before while also limiting yourself to just a couple of paragraphs at most. Don't worry about being Shakespeare, just write down the way you would explain it to the players. Think of it as the movie trailer for your setting. If fail to hit the high points no one will be interested or possibly even understand it. At this point though, do not bog yourself down in detail.</p>
<h2>Who are the Characters?</h2>
<p>Think about it your game from the players' perspective. What kind of characters do they often like to play and what kind of characters do you see them playing in your game? You will need to be able to explain to them what kind of characters they can make and how they fit into the world. This must be followed up by the very important question what do they do? What kind of adventures will they go on? How can their characters fit into the adventure easily without you having to invent the flimsiest of reasons to include them. The easier you make it on them at this point, the less work it is going to be on you to bring them in and keep them all together.</p>
<p>Some players get a sadistic joy out of playing against type. You might be casting a supers team made up of mutants that all work together and one person who declares himself to be the feral loner. These characters can complicate things quite a bit. We aren't saying not to allow them, although that is your call. You will need to speak with this player to make sure you are both on the same page. Maybe the crazy professor that pulled them together also gave them all radios to stay in constant communication. If all else fails gently remind them this is a group oriented game.</p>
<h2>What are the Rules?</h2>
<p>We think we have a pretty good set here with [Mini OpenD6], but some might call us biased. You might be happy with the default rules, but maybe you want something a little different. Okay Mr. Picky, write down which optional rules you are going to use. Which combat system are you going to use? Hint, hint, we think Static is Faster, but maybe you're a traditionalist at heart. That's okay, we still love you. You might have your own ideas for another magic system if your game uses that or you decide to run with the Body Points system instead of Wound Levels.</p>
<p>The optional rules you can use though are not just limited to the choices we give in this rule book, it includes your own ideas and editions, those special flourishes that make the game your own. But whatever you do, be sure to write it down for consistency later and tell your players before they make characters. It is only the nice thing to do.</p>
<h2>What are the Skills?</h2>
<p>Start by writing down the attributes in separate columns. Then place the skills under them that you think will be useful in the game you plan to run. Some skills may be broader than others depending on how useful they are in your opinion. For example, in many games there is just a skill called Science which covers Biology, Chemistry, Math, and many more boring subjects except for Medicine. But, if you are playing a game where the characters are scientists exploring the galaxy through stargates, you might need several different, more specific, Science skills.</p>
<h2>New Perks or Complications?</h2>
<p>This is your chance to help reinforce the game through new racial perks you make, codes of honor, etc. Players love new stuff. It also serves to further develop any archetypes you dreamed up.</p>
<h2>How are Money and Gear Handled?</h2>
<p>Most players are going to want to know how much stuff they can get their hands on. If your game is one where they count their dollars and spend specific amounts be sure to let them know and even prepare a price list and basic monetary notation. You might take a more laid back approach and say that a knight owns armor, a sword, and a horse; while his wizard companion has a pointed hat, musty books, and a stout walking stick. However you decide to do this, just try and be consistent and fair.</p>
<h2>What are You Going to do When You Run Out of Ideas?</h2>
<p>Well, you're having ideas right now, so start writing these adventures seeds and save them for a rainy day. Just a paragraph or two is all you need to do. It will help keep it in your mind and when you are too busy with life or suffering from writer's block these morsels will be sitting there on your plate. A handy formula is a basic scenario plus one complication. Now have at it!</p>
<h1>Campaigning the TV Way</h1>
<p>Think of the campaign as a television series. You can &quot;cast&quot; the characters and NPCs from celebrities instead of describing what your character looks like just name the actor that plays him. Keep in mind how dramatic and action oriented shows are structured. They have plot arcs that stretch many &quot;episodes&quot; and there is always a season finale. After the season is over take a break from that game and play something else. Even if everyone wants to dive back into it immediately take at least a short break. Run a game in a different setting, break out that $100 board game you bought, whatever. Think of this time off as a palette cleanser. And when the game is started again that's a new season and everyone will be looking forward to it.</p>
<p>One of the fun things about this style of play is the ability to use cinematic techniques like a director does. If your players enjoy this style there are some tricks to further spice things up. Research is easy, plop down in front of your favorite show and start watching, making mental notes about the things you like. With practice you could run a game like a Tarantino flick.</p>
<h2>Flash Forwards</h2>
<p>Write down a few vague lines of dialogue on index cards and number them. Then hand them out but don't let your players look at them until their number comes up. The player with card number one reads their line, then two responds by reading his, and so on. You don't want to give the plot away or make anything too specific; it is more to tease them. Keep in mind that at some point they should catch up to the flash forward and will hopefully cooperate with what has already been established. This might be in the same session, or several later depending on how you plan the campaign.</p>
<p>A second flash forward technique would start the adventure at some dramatic point between the middle and end of the episode. By describing what the characters are doing, how they look, and where they are, you can surprise them. Keep in mind though not to give too much away or nail down so many details they have no say in the path that brought them to this point. The characters should still have free will. For example, at the beginning of the session the GM narrates, &quot;The three of you are standing before a pillar made of human skulls. Baelendor seems to have lost his lost his old armor; all the troupe's provisions are also missing. You are hot, tired, and bloody...&quot; at some point one of the players will challenge how they got there. Then the GM says, &quot;Two days previously...&quot; and then start the adventure from the beginning. With luck they will eventually stand in that moment and the players will enjoy returning to that point in the story.</p>
<p>When using flash forwards don't take away the players' free will. If they don't end up where the flash forward happened, that must have been some alternative future. If the players won't let go of their metagame knowledge of the flash forward don't use them again.</p>
<h2>Flash Backs</h2>
<p>Another popular TV device is looking into the past. During the game it's possible to run an adventure from before the first episode. You will have to give some thought to how powerful the characters should be at that point in their development and it should tie to the current storyline. Some players may grumble that they earned skills they can't use because the character doesn't know them yet. Tell them to stop whining and remind them that they can still use the points they earned from the past they just played through on those skills they couldn't use. Of course if your players don't enjoy these occasional forays then don't use them. Because even if you enjoy them, you will not enjoy five people whining for three hours.</p>
<h1>Converting Between [Mini OpenD6] &amp; Traditional OpenD6</h1>
<p>Even though [Mini OpenD6] is part of the OpenD6 family, it has been tweaked in several ways. By making the following changes and applying the noted optional rules you can make Mni Six resemble its more recognized parent.</p>
<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p>Player characters start with six attributes and distribute 18D among them. There are three common sets of attributes depending on the genre played. The following chart may help convert characters between the systems. Once dice have been distributed check your math. If you have more than 18D in traditional OpenD6, or 12D in [Mini OpenD6], adjust for balance using common sense. If you have too few dice spent, then spend the remaining dice as best fits the character concept.</p>
<p><em>[Mini OpenD6] Equivalent: OpenD6 Fantasy: OpenD6 Adventure: OpenD6 Sci-Fi</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Might: Physique: Physique: Strength</li>
<li>Agility: Agility: Reflexes: Dexterity</li>
<li>Agility: Coordination: Coordination: n/a</li>
<li>Wit: Intellect: Knowledge: Knowledge</li>
<li>Charm: Charm: Presence: n/a</li>
<li>(Wit+Charm)/2: Acumen: Perception: Perception</li>
<li>(Agility+Wit)/2: n/a: n/a: Mechanical</li>
<li>Wit: n/a: n/a: Technical</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills may move to new attributes. Simply review the skill list provided by the GM and note accordingly.</p>
<h2>Extranormal Skills</h2>
<p>OpenD6 Fantasy has Miracles and Magic. OpenD6 Adventure has Magic and Psionics. OpenD6 Science Fiction has Channel, Sense, and Transform. All of these are considered Paranormal Abilities that use the Quasi Skills optional rule.</p>
<h2>The Wild Die</h2>
<p>When a 1 is rolled on the Wild Die in traditional OpenD6 it can have three possible effects based on GM fiat;</p>
<ol>
<li>It can be treated normally and added to the roll.</li>
<li>It is ignored along with the highest normal die rolled.</li>
<li>It causes a complication to the action taken.</li>
</ol>
<p>Options Used by Traditional OpenD6:</p>

</ul>
<h1>Perdition</h1>
<p>&quot;Your great-grandpa's great-grandpa came here in a big ship. It was so big that whole cities of people were inside. Here was so far away from Earth that everyone slept the whole way. They turned the ships into factories on the nicest worlds, and but nobody else ever came from Earth. Maybe they went to another system. Strange that we never heard anything. The first worlds filled up and they changed the ones that weren't so nice, the frontier worlds like ours, into better ones so that we could live here too. Folk being as they are, they fell to squabblin' soon enough. The First Worlds have it easy compared to us frontiersmen, but we've got something they'll never understand. You can't put it in a box, or put it in a book, or put a price on it even if they did win the war. It's still ours.&quot; -- Old man to his grandson</p>
<p>Humanity came to Vega because of war, pollution, limited resources, and overpopulation. The pioneers travelled the 25 light years in cryonic sleep on a voyage that took over 300 years. When they arrived they founded a new civilization, called the League, which is parliamentary in nature. As more worlds are colonized, the power of the League grew, but rifts began to develop between the older heavily industrialized worlds and the younger thinly populated frontier worlds of Lantos and Leton.</p>
<p>The war lasted for six years, and hundreds of thousands died in battles both on the ground and in space. The frontier rebels were eventually defeated and Lantos and Leton rejoined the League, although their voices are weak in parliament.</p>
<p>The player characters of Perdition take the roles of scavengers, honorable scoundrels, and thieves with conscience. They share a dislike, possibly even a hatred for the League, but they're not part of a rebel military. Those days are gone forever. They're not terrorists or single-minded lunatics bent on revenge. They operate outside of League law, but they're not sociopaths. They will defend themselves, their friends, and their families, but they aren't murderers or pirates. They're people out on the edge of a frontier. They rob banks, they steal stuff, they swindle League stooges, they smuggle contraband, they raid League outposts, and above all else, they get paid.</p>
<p>But they don't steal from the poor. They don't extort the virtuous. They always keep their word. They don't kill the innocent or leave them to die, ‘cause deep down they're damned fool heroes.</p>

<h2>Advice for the GM</h2>
<p>Perdition is a space-western. There are no ray guns, no aliens, no faster-than-light travel, and no artificial intelligences. The miracle technologies available are limited to spaceships, artificial gravity inside spaceships, terraforming, and cryonic sleep -- but the latter has few applications in the Worlds of Vega nowadays.</p>
<p>The industrialized worlds are little different from modern day Earth aside from these miracle techs. The League is strong there, but there are good folk on every world.</p>
<p>The frontier worlds are rougher and more homespun. People have had to be self sufficient to survive and there's little to no infrastructure in most places. That means that horses are often more reliable than cars and trucks. (You can grow and feed horses locally, but you have to import complex machines and fuel.) Justice tends to be more about the spirit of the law than the letter, but most folks can only expect whatever justice they create.</p>
<h2>The Worlds of the Vega System</h2>
<p>There are eleven true planets and another 78 moons in the Vega system. Of those, one planet is inhabited and three additional planets host a total of 37 moons that have been terraformed to human tolerance.</p>
<p>Vega is a blue star, much larger and hotter than Earth's sun. It has four small, rocky inner planets, and seven outer gas giants. Inside the orbit of the innermost three planets (Pallas, Perses, and Asteria) is the Typhon Asteroid Belt, which is usually just called the Belt by veteran spacers. Mining outfits large and small work the rocks for silver, gold, and other precious ores.</p>
<h2>Standard Travel Times</h2>
<p><em>From: To: Time</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Nomos: Belt: 1D6 + 1 Days</li>
<li>Nomos or Belt: Ophion Worlds: 1 Week + 1D6 Days</li>
<li>Nomos or Belt: Lelantosian Worlds: 2 Weeks + 1D6 Days</li>
<li>Nomos or Belt: Leton Worlds: 3 Weeks + 1D6 Days</li>
<li>Ophion Worlds: Ophion Worlds: 1D6 Weeks</li>
<li>Ophion Worlds: Lelantosian Worlds: 1 Week + 2D6 Days</li>
<li>Ophion Worlds: Leton Worlds: 2 Weeks + 2D6 Days</li>
<li>Lelantosian Worlds: Lelantosian Worlds: 1D6 Days</li>
<li>Lelantosian Worlds: Leton Worlds: 1 Week + 3D6 Days</li>
<li>Leton Worlds: Leton Worlds: 1D6 Days</li>
</ul>
<h2>Navigation Bonus</h2>
<p>A pilot or another crewman can try to speed up the journey by making a special check. Roll the character's Navigation skill plus the Move of the vessel. Compare the result to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 or less: 2x Standard Time</li>
<li>11-20: Standard Time</li>
<li>21-40: 90% of Standard Time</li>
<li>41+: 75% of Standard Time</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Mechanic's Work is Never Done</h2>
<p>Someone must spend time keeping every ship running. For small ships (scale +6D or less), a mechanic must make a repair roll with a TN equal to the 1/2 the trip's standard travel time (in days) + 10. This check is made at the midway point of the voyage. If he fails the check, roll on the vehicle damage chart to see what's broke.</p>
<h2>The Paranormal</h2>
<p>Psychics are rare, and most educated people don't believe they exist. For every real psychic, there are a hundred charlatans conning people out of their money. No other special abilities are known to exist aside from ESP.</p>
<h2>Adventure Seeds</h2>
<h3>The Eosian Job</h3>
<p>Another gang wants to team up to rob the Safety Society Bank on Eos, which handles the payroll for nearby Fort Temperance. The leader of the gang suspects that one of his crew is a traitor after finding a League transmitting device, and wants the heroes to figure out who it is.</p>
<h3>Strange Bedfellows</h3>
<p>The town of Baggs on Silenus asks for help against a cult who follow a supposed psychic. The leader of the gang is also wanted by the League for her crimes. The problem is that she's the eighteen year old daughter of a League minister.</p>
<h1>Rust Moon of Castia</h1>
<p>They say the moon turned red when the Radiant Queen was born. Sages across the land studied the portent's meaning, but the skalds of Kauleshan knew that destiny was on their side. As she grew she united the northern tribes into a mighty force. Still this did not sate her thirst for power. She turned her covetous eye to the ancient throne of Castia. The war was harsh and swift. In the end only the four Elons stood against her horde but even they could not hold out in the face of her magic. In plundering our libraries she uncovered the Prophecy of the Marks of Radiance. Now she is obsessed with hunting our daughters. Her ambition is now twisted with her lust for eternal life. Now that we have learned to hide the vessel children things have gotten worse for the people. Rumors claim she has begun to grow old, she has grown desperate. -- Mardegant the Wise, Secret Sage of Etain.</p>
<p>Castia was once a proud kingdom, its boundaries stretching from the Northern Forest south to the farmlands surrounding Lake Tarsis and east to the Teerna Sea. Legends claim that for centuries it was ruled by a line of wise kings who sought only safety for their subjects and peace with their neighbors. Bards still sing of this golden age, reminding all of what life was like in a land of joy deep in their memories. Because memories seldom whisper of anything other than beauty when waking eyes see only the mark of evil upon the land.</p>
<p>Dark times fell across the land when the moon turned red. Each night when the Rusting Eye passed over, strife would spread by leagues. Sydra and Nehar began to bite at the borders while the Syndics of Westron encroached on the forest. When raiders of Kauleshan invaded, none saw the true threat offered by the illorganized barbarians. Only after the Scarlet Horde stood at the gates of Devmora did the king see the fate awaiting him. It took only three more summers for the once proud kingdom to fall.</p>
<p>During the plundering of Etain the new royal's sages unearthed the Prophecy of the Marks of Radiance. Few speak of it openly but all well travelled folk now know how it reads,</p>
<p>&quot;Into each generation there will be born 13 daughters, one for each moon that passes over the sky. They share a common mark, a common spirit. From each the Radiant Light may burn, into each the Radiant Light may flow. May this Immortal Dynast guide us wisely, for guide us she will as long her line remains unbroken.&quot;</p>
<p>Devmora: once a prosperous trade city, the Scarlet Horde seized it for their dark mistress. The Radiant Queen claimed the town as her own. In the hundred years since she claimed the throne, the Radiant Queen has transformed the city into a mighty, many tiered and sectioned, fortress. The various city quarters all divided into compact wards. Great walls and loyal fanatics ensure their queen is safe from the outside world she chooses to rule so harshly.</p>
<p>Kauleshan: the name of both the greatest northern city and the barbarian lands surrounding it. It is a brooding, cold land filled with harsh myths, dark cults, and berserker warriors. Not all of the northern clans joined the Radiant Queen's cause. Those who resisted were cursed or publicly put to death. Still some clans chose exile or retreat into more remote places instead of surrendering their freedom for her promises of glory.</p>
<p>Etain: Once the capital of Castia, it still bears the scars of the savage plundering inflicted upon it. Here the Radiant Queen struck hardest of all cities that still have life in them. After a hundred years many citizens of Etain still look hollow, carrying a broken spirit for the horrors they are always reminded of.</p>
<p>Engalt: The largest Hannedyn population near the Castian Realms, it is their common city ruled by a council of elders and a High Judge chosen from among the council to barter treaties with the larger lands of humans. The larger folk seldom take the smaller ones seriously, and even in their own towns and villages the phrase &quot;Out of the way Speck!&quot; can easily be heard. Few humans give the smaller race's great city much thought, but within its stunted rooms and narrow alleys many secrets still linger.</p>
<p>Tarsis Elon: The last of the four fortresses to fall, it suffered the worst of the four curses. All who once lived there are now encased in translucent stone, alive but entombed. For each year that passes in the outside world, these poor souls age a single day. If any are chiseled free time comes rushing upon them bringing immediate death by old age. Still, more than a curse was left to watch Tarsis. Monsters, minions, and shadows without name haunt this doomed sanctuary. Rumors abound about what is still kept here. Some claim a great vault filled with gold, others speak of lost magics. Even if only a cache of ancient weapons, it would be a great fortune to those foolhardy enough to try and claim them.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Hannedyn (2): A short race standing half the size of men, they live in Engelt and the surrounding region. Humans tend to call them by their slang name Halfling or the popular insult Speck. While not technically subjects of the Castian throne they do pay tribute in exchange for continued peace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their small stature grants a bonus to Stealth (+1D) and Dodge (+1D) when fighting creatures man-sized or larger. All Hannedyn must take the Small complication while their Might is limited to 3D+1.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Gear for Brownies and Hanedyn</h3>
<p>Any item can be made for tiny or small characters. The statistics are the same as their normal sized counterparts. Simply apply the Tiny or Small penalty as appropriate. Characters that try to use items too big for their size suffer double normal penalties.</p>
<h2>Advice for the GM</h2>
<p>Rust Moon of Castia is classic fantasy adventure; a world of heroes and adventurers fighting for fortune and glory under the dangerous gaze of an evil overlord and bickering nations. They can be heroes, mercenaries for hire, or free wheeling adventurers just trying to find the next lost treasure horde. It is always best to work with players when deciding on what kind of fantasy campaign to run because tastes can vary wildly.</p>
<h2>Adventure Seeds</h2>
<h3>The Golden Key</h3>
<p>The player characters have found the key to the Vault of Lorna Fields. Legends tell of a hidden treasure horde to the east of Lorna Elon. When the key is held at the Crossroads under the light of the full moon the entrance will be revealed. Some legends speak of great wealth; others though make it less glamorous. Whispering of dark monsters held fast until the ancient line of kings would offer mercy and freedom if the beasts accepted a geas. Those still held refused such a punishment.</p>
<h3>Down the Fairie Ring</h3>
<p>While travelling through the deep forest the player characters stumble into a Fairie Ring. These magical doorways are normally closed, but sadly this fairie keep has fallen under a curse and now they seek to bring others into their madness. The players must find their way out or break the curse before madness captures them as well.</p>

<h1>Imperium in Revolt</h1>
<p>It is a dark time across the galaxy. Forces of the Grand Imperium have crushed the last vestiges of the once great Galactic Commonwealth. As tyranny spreads a few brave and desperate souls have dared to stand against the Sovereign's power. Rebels attempting to show the galaxy that freedom can be claimed if people are willing to stand up for what they believe in. The future is uncertain, but it will be forged by the spirit of heroes.</p>
<p>For 5,000 years the Galactic Commonwealth grew, stretching across the galaxy. Starting from the Founding Systems who mastered the secrets of hyperspace travel, they explored and expanded bringing thousands races together under a common banner of prosperity. What felt like an eternity of good fortune bred its own peculiar evil. At first none noticed the corruption taking seed in the honored halls of galactic power.</p>
<p>Factions formed in the Senate, each coveting what others had amassed. Many senators viewed the systems they represented more as personal fiefdoms than states within the galactic body. Bickering replaced diplomacy. Trade blockades and strikes were common threats. The Senate was paralyzed. Systems starved as trade stagnated denying them goods they needed for survival.</p>
<p>The Galactic Navy, reduced in strength after so long a peace, was ordered to act as a barrier between individual system Militia Fleets but the military power was not up to the task. Skirmishes erupted between factions. The final blow came when the President of the Senate was murdered in the Grand Hall by rivals who feared his measured words.</p>
<p>It was the Taurani senator who took center stage in the ensuing madness. Gathering the still loyal factions of the Commonwealth together, convincing them to merge individual Militia Fleets with the Galactic Navy. Factories producing critical goods were seized by the government to save dying worlds. Blockades were shattered and trade forcefully reestablished. Media was silenced to protect galactic security as order was restored.</p>
<p>In only a dozen years the senator concentrated enough power to declare himself Sovereign. At his fiery self-coronation the new dictator promised a new golden age in a Grand Imperium. Yet not all hope was lost.</p>
<h2>Character Creation Guidelines</h2>
<p>Characters may purchase the Sorcerer perk. The Star Paladins section explains how magic is treated in the game universe and the complications related to selecting it.</p>
<h2>Skill List</h2>
<ul>
<li>Might: Athletics, Brawling, Lift, Melee, Plasma Sword, Stamina, Swimming</li>
<li>Agility: BFG, Dodge, Drive, Pilot, Pistol, Rifle, Stealth, Throwing</li>
<li>Wit: Computers/Androids, Cultures, Demolitions, Gunnery, Languages, History, Magic, Medicine, Navigation, Repair, Science, Search, Security, Star Systems, Tracking</li>
<li>Charm: Command, Courage, Diplomacy, Gambling, Seduce, Streetwise</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Perks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Alien Races (varies): Sample aliens provided include Avari, Kaishee, and Telmek but GM's are encouraged to create additional alien races to further flesh out the many races found within the Imperium. Just be reasonable and cautious when determining how much a race should cost (if any) as a perk.</p></li>
<li><p>Avari (1): Natives of Varos, the Avari stand only 5 to 5½ feet and have an oddly uniform appearance. Their hair is always white and their complexion is a dusk-toned pale gray. Avari have the ability to compartmentalize their mind. If using only Wit skills, they can take two actions with no multi-action penalty; but their Might is limited to 3D.</p></li>
<li><p>Cyborg (2): A significant portion of your body has been replaced with artificial components. You require half the sustenance others need and can override electronic pain receptors. You suffer1D less wound penalties than others when injured to Wounded or worse. However the TN of all healing rolls is increased by +5.</p></li>
<li><p>Kaishee (1): Indigenous to the Kalavel system. Kaishee are a large hairless people. They stand a full foot taller than the average human. Kaishee skin tones range from a deep golden bronze to a faint pale orange while their eyes are a single solid color with black and deep green being most common. Kaishee have an intuitive understanding of spatial relationships that gives them a +2 bonus on Navigation, Search and Tracking. Their eyes also provide them with natural light amplification and filtering reducing all penalties for darkness by half. Kaishee have a maximum Might of 5D but their maximum Wit is 3D and their maximum Agility is 3D+1.</p></li>
<li><p>Telmek(2): Natives of Telmera, they have a build similar to humans but with decidedly reptilian features. Their skin is a tough serpent hide and their hair is both thick and slick. Primarily carnivores, their teeth are composed mainly of incisors which unsettles many humans when they choose to smile. Telmek metabolic and mental cycles allow them to function with only four to five hours sleep per night. Because of their tough skin Telmek receive a +2 armor bonus.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>New Complications</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Hunted: All rebels are sought by the Imperium, but some are more sought after than others. This is most often found among the Star Paladins and those who studied their ways. The Imperium has a standing bounty of 10,000 credits for information leading to the capture of any Star Paladin. Some paladins have additional bounties attached to them. Hunted characters receive an additional CP when this becomes an active issue in the adventure.</p></li>
<li><p>Large Debt: You owe someone a lot. Maybe one of your deals went bad, maybe you borrowed to buy that ship you always wanted. No matter how it came about you are in debt. Most of your spare money is going to go to pay this off and whoever you owe will likely call on you from time to time to perform extra favors for them as a &quot;friendly&quot; form of interest. Gain 1 CP for any adventure where your debtor gets involved in your business.</p></li>
<li><p>Total Pacifist: This complication is frequently hard programmed into civilian androids to keep them from turning on their masters.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Order of the Star Paladins</h2>
<p>Since the first days of the Commonwealth the Star Paladins acted as defenders of the peace; traveling across the galaxy offering aid to any in need. Possessing mystical powers that seemingly defy science, They were viewed with both reverence and a small amount of fear. With the power at their command temptation to wickedness was always a danger. To combat this, the masters who founded the order developed a code all paladins must abide by. Over time it was distilled down to four simple statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Justice tempered by mercy.</li>
<li>Passion tempered by virtue.</li>
<li>Honor tempered by humility.</li>
<li>Knowledge tempered by Wisdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Rogue Paladins were always a danger, the order formed a special faction called the Shadow Guard. They were charged with watching for signs of paladins that might fall to evil and either counsel them back to the path of honor or bring them to the High Council for judgment.</p>
<p>A young master was given leadership of the Shadow Guard when the Sovereign was rising to power. Unknown to the High Council, this master had sworn allegiance to the Sovereign. His position let him keep the Star Paladins blind to the Sovereign's ultimate goal until it was too late. On Coronation Day, the ancient order was outlawed. The Shadow Guard became the Inquisition and now hunt for their former brothers in arms.</p>
<h2>Using Magic in the Imperium</h2>
<p>In the universe of the Imperium there is a supernatural force at work. Characters with the perk Sorcerer can access this power. Not all spells listed in the magic section are appropriate though. By selecting the spells allowed the GM's helps reinforce the way magic works in their universe. It is suggested that Star Paladins select from the following: Beast Tongue, Bless, Charm, Curse, Dark Vision, Death Spell, Dispel Magic, Divination, ESP, Levitate (see Fly), Hasten, Illusions, Paralysis, Resist Elements, See Magic Aura, Slumber, Still Mind, and Telekinesis.</p>
<p>Additional powers can also be created to help showcase the unique powers of the Star Paladins. For Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sense Danger (TN: 19)</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Resisted: None</p>
<p>The caster attunes himself to any threats within 60 feet. This gives a +2D bonus to dodge, parry and block. The Paladin may also use his plasma sword to parry ranged attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Galaxy</h2>
<p>The Imperium stretches from the Founding Systems to the most distant arms of the galaxy. Thousands of inhabited worlds and countless more colonies fall under its sphere of authority. Still space is vast and the number of planets with life on them is seemingly endless. New worlds in remote locations are still found. Sometimes Rebel Command is able to work out treaties and use them as secret bases. Other times Imperium scouts discover the world and log it in detail for later inclusion and harvesting.</p>
<p>Because of the Imperium's strength, few systems dare openly fly the Rebel banner. Still, some planets have chosen to take that desperate stand even in the face of harsh marshal law. What follows are a few of the systems that have taken a stand in the civil war.</p>
<p>Ajada: One of the old Commonwealth's Founding Systems. They suffered greatly during the collapse of the old government and greatly benefited from the Sovereign's ascension. This makes them extremely loyal. Many of the finest officers in the Galactic Navy hail from Ajada. Its system is also the location of the largest Imperium shipyards.</p>
<p>Kalavel: Homeworld of the Kaishee, it was a system full of great natural resources, it was also the first to rebel against the Imperium. The Navy struck at them hard and fast. Many of the natives were forced into slavery as punishment for rebellion and the once lush world is now a blasted shell of its former self.</p>
<p>Petrion: This system holds the seat of galactic power. Once home to the Grand Hall of the Senate, it now acts as host to the Sovereign's throne. A planet of bureaucrats and royal sycophants, it's extremely dangerous to be a rebel sympathizer here.</p>
<p>Tauran: For millennia the noble houses of this Founding System were little more than figureheads. How the Sovereign converted an ancient honorific into a powerbase is unknown, but many Taurani hold their heads in shame at the terror they let loose from their world in a moment of weakness. Many in the Rebel Command claim Taurani heritage.</p>
<h2>Hyperdrive Technology</h2>
<p>Uniting the Founding Systems and creating galactic trade, the hyperdrive (HD) works by passing through a dimension called hyperspace. This allows cosmic distances to be travelled in a matter of days instead of a dozen millennia, but while in hyperspace ships can't send or receive any transmissions or sensor data. All ships built with HD's are given a rating. This acts as a multiplier applied to their travel time. It is against Imperium Law for any civilian craft to be equipped with a drive rated better than x2.</p>
<h2>Sub-Light Travel Times</h2>
<p>Travel within a solar system is normally a fairly simple affair. Ships lock their sensors onto a series of planetary beacons and follow them to the desired destination. Travel time between inner worlds is only 1d6 hours, but when attempting to cross the outer planets it takes 2d6 hours.</p>
<p>Ships can choose to hide their approach by not using the beacons, network but this requires a Moderate Navigation roll. On a failure the ship goes off course doubling the travel time. Pilots can also attempt to speed up the travel time by rolling their Pilot skill adding the Move dice of the ship. If the pilot rolls a Moderate level of success the travel time is reduced 10%. A Difficult roll reduces travel time by 20%, a Very Difficult roll reduces travel time by 30% and a Heroic roll reduces the time by 50%.</p>
<h2>Travel Time Between Systems</h2>
<p>The times listed below are the average amount of time needed to travel directly between two systems. To make the trip successfully a Moderate Navigation roll is required. Because of possible obstacles between two systems it is often faster to travel indirectly. By flying to an intermediary spaceport ships can save time.</p>
<p>If the pilot plots their own coordinates they can attempt to reduce the time needed and avoid Imperium entanglements often found on the more common trade routes. If the pilot makes a Difficult Navigation roll the time needed is reduced 10%, a Very Difficult roll reduces the time by 25%, and a Heroic roll reduces the time by 50%. These &quot;shortcuts&quot; take advantage of the celestial movement and cannot be reused. If the roll is a failure the jump fails causing one wound level of damage to the ship, and increases the travel time required by 1d6 days if the normal time needed is over one day or 1d6 hours if less than a day.</p>

<h2>Money and Gear</h2>
<p>The coin of the galaxy is called the Imperial Credit. Several local systems and small independent worlds also issue their own currency, but they are seldom worth anything beyond the issuing region's border.</p>
<p>The Imperium tracks large (in excess of 20,000) credit transfers between individuals, but while the law dictates strict enforcement many bankers and civil servants have a streak of laziness and corruption. This works to the advantage of both organized crime, independent grifters, smugglers, and stalwart rebels.</p>
<p>Imperium law also forbids civilians from owning unregistered weapons, assault rifles, and body armor. Papers are issued locally. Fortunately forgeries are easy to come by and the data cores holding the information easily hacked.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the GM let the players have a spaceship to use in their travels. This ship could be borrowed from the Rebel Command or one of the players might be in debt to a loan shark for the hefty cost of a heavily customized vessel. Civilian ships are not allowed armaments, so any weapons placed on a ship will need either forged documents granting permission or be somehow concealable from casual scanning. GM's should use the plot device that best serves the needs of their individual games.</p>
<p>Personal weapons include a variety of energy weapons ranging from holdout lasers to heavy disrupter pistols. Those going into heavy combat also try to get their hands on laser rifles and blaster carbines. Body armor ranges from reinforced clothing to bulky fully body armor favored by mercenaries.</p>

<h2>Advice for the GM</h2>
<p>Imperium in Revolt is classic space opera. Laser weapons, energy shields, thousands of alien races, and a universe where a few brave souls can change the fates of entire worlds. It is larger than life featuring daring deeds that are breathtaking in scope. The most civilized planets are covered in mega-cities while remote worlds are home to ancient trees standing a half mile tall. Desert worlds and ocean planets can be found along with alien landscapes of liquid metal seas and fiery vistas.</p>
<p>Adventures often take place on a single world but they need not stay confined to only one. By incorporating world spanning adventures you can help reinforce how interconnected the Imperium is. Part of what gave the Sovereign his opportunity was the stories of worlds that starved to death because they depended on galactic trade for basic necessities. Playing on both the careful deceptions of imperial propaganda and the discovering ruins of dead worlds can heighten the desperation felt across the galaxy as it struggles for freedom.</p>
<p>As for the Imperium itself, it works hard to put on a friendly protective face for the public but in truth its officers are frequently cruel, ambitious men who cannot be trusted. Despite this stereotype of casual evil, the major imperial characters can still be complex people with likes, loves, and secrets of their own. It can be fun to play to the maniacal villains trying to destroy the PC's but if you give that recurring villain a bit of depth and history there can be more potential to draw on later. These complex recurring villains can add depth to your game, but if the players are clever enough to take one down you should let them succeed.</p>
<h2>Adventure Seeds</h2>
<h3>The Salvage Yard</h3>
<p>A damaged rebel frigate took refuge in an abandoned asteroid mining operation. The ship's life support failed leaving only a drifting hulk. Imperium forces are now looking for the ship and the secret transmissions it holds. The players need to locate and retrieve the ship's computer core before the Imperium does.</p>
<p>Unknown to both sides, hidden among the drifting ships and abandoned equipment are the aliens that destroyed the mining operation and they are getting hungry again.</p>
<h3>Our New Hope</h3>
<p>Rebel Command has discovered that a master from the Order of Star Paladins has been living in seclusion on a remote world, hidden from the Inquisition. The rebels also realize that if they have learned of his whereabouts, the Inquisition might have too. Someone needs to try and get word to the once great knight about the danger he is in.</p>
<p>The GM may have the paladin be alive, fallen into wickedness, or already dead leaving only a few scraps of cryptic knowledge and a journal or maybe someone claiming to be his apprentice.</p>
