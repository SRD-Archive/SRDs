OpenD6 Adventure SRD Text
=========================



Introduction
------------

This book provides the fundamentals necessary to play in a Wild
West, pulp ﬁction, modern adventure, espionage, low-level super
hero, or similar setting using West End Game’s famous D6 System
roleplaying game rules.
If you’re reading this book, you probably already know what a roleplaying game is. In case you need a refresher or to explain it to your
friends, we suggest telling them that this is an interactive storytelling
game wherein they play the part of major characters in the story. If
they’re still interested, let them read this introduction.
You might also want to start with this introduction if you’ve roleplayed before getting this book but it wasn’t with the D6 System.

What Is a Roleplaying Game?
A roleplaying game is very much like improvisational acting or
interactive storytelling — but with rules. Many video games are like
this, and there are plenty of online interactive worlds, so chances are
good that you know what a roleplaying game is about. This roleplaying
game, however, doesn’t need any expensive equipment or special software
or cartridges or a connection to the Internet.

What Do I Need to Play?
To play this game, you need this book, some paper, something to
write with, some six-sided dice, a lot of imagination, and a group of
people, one of whom is willing to be the guiding force in the game.
This person is called many things, but “gamemaster” serves well as a
short hand for someone who presents information about the game
setting and obstacles the other players encounter; who takes the part
of the people the players’ characters interact with; and who adjudicates
the rules. The rest of the group, simply called “the players,” take on
roles of major characters in the story that they and the gamemaster
create together.
The stories are called “adventures,” or “scenarios.” Very short adventures, usually encompassing only one or two obstacles to a simple goal,
are referred to as “encounters.” A series of encounters can become an
adventure, while a series of adventures can turn into a campaign. This
book contains a chapter on how to come up with adventures, and West
End Games has an encounter generator online.

Where Do I Go Next?
Will you be you joining a game where everyone else knows how
to play, and you don’t have a lot of time to learn the rules? Read
Chapter 1, “Character Basics” and then ﬂip to the character templates
on pages 128–137 of this book. Ask the gamemaster which one or ones

you can use. (These are also available for downloading from the West
End Games Web site). Fill in the template as you learned from Chapter
1, then take the sheet to the game session and start playing. The rest
of the players will teach the details as you go along.
Do you have some time to learn the rules, but you don’t want to
be the gamemaster? Read all of the chapters up through the “Healing”
chapter. In this introduction is a solitaire adventure that will get you
started on the basics; the rest of the chapters ﬁll in more details. Then
skip to the “Equipment” chapter. If you want to play someone with
psychic or magical abilities, you’ll also need to read those chapters.
Do you want to be the gamemaster, with all its responsibilities
and privileges? You’ll need to read this entire book, or at least through
the “Healing” chapter and skim the rest. Then use the “Adventure Tips”
chapter to design your own scenario, invite some friends over, introduce
them to creating characters, and have fun!

System Overview
This overview provides basic concepts germane to roleplaying with
the D6 System. The concepts presented herein are further explained in
the rest of this book, and an introductory adventure will give you a
chance to try out what you’ve learned here.

Making Actions
Each player has a character with attributes and skills that describe
how well that character can perform various actions. Attributes represent a character’s innate abilities, while skills are speciﬁc applications
of those abilities.
Most game mechanics in D6 involve rolling some six-sided dice. A
die code associated with each attribute and skill represents how good
the character is in that area. A die code associated with a weapon
shows how much harm it can cause. The larger the number, the more
experienced, trained, or naturally adept your character is, or the more
deadly the weapon, or the more useful the equipment.
Each die code indicates the number of six-sided dice you roll when
you want your character to do something (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, etc.),
and sometimes an added bonus (called pips) of “+1” or “+2” you add
to the total result you roll on the dice.
Example: If your character’s Physique attribute is 3D+1, when you
have her try to lift a cargo container, you would roll three dice and add
1 to the total to get her result.
To represent the randomness of life (and the tons of little modiﬁers
that go along with it), every time you roll dice, make sure that one of
them is of a diﬀerent color than the others. This special die is the Wild

world will need to add their own mod

Die, and it can have some interesting eﬀects on your dice total. (If you
only have one die to roll, then that die is the Wild Die.)
If the Wild Die comes up as a 2, 3, 4, or 5, add the result to the
other dice normally. If the Wild Die comes up as a 6, this is a Critical
Success. Add the 6 to your other dice results and roll the Wild Die
again. As long as you roll a 6, you keep adding the 6 and you keep
rolling. If you roll anything else, you add that number to the total and
stop rolling. If the Wild Die comes up as a 1 on the ﬁrst roll, this is a
Critical Failure. Tell the gamemaster, who will let you know whether
or not to add it to your total.
The higher you roll, the better your character accomplishes the task
at hand. When your character tries doing something, the gamemaster
decides on the required skill and a diﬃculty based on the task’s complexity. The gamemaster doesn’t usually tell you the diﬃculty number
you need to equal or beat to succeed. He often won’t inform you which
tasks are easier and which are harder, though he might give you hints.
(“Hmmm, catching your grappling hook around that small outcropping
is going to be pretty hard.…”) The gamemaster then uses the rules to
interpret the die roll and determine the results of the action.

Taking Damage
To describe how much injury a character can sustain, the gamemaster decides on one of two ways of determining how much damage
a character can take: Body Points or Wounds.
With the Body Points system, each character has a certain number
of Body Points (which are ﬁgured out when you create your character).
You subtract the amount of damage the attacker rolls for his weapon
from the total number of Body Points your character has.
With the Wounds system, each character has a certain number of
Wounds. You roll your character’s Physique while the attacker rolls
damage. Compare the diﬀerence between the damage and the Physique
roll a Wounds level chart; the chart lets you know how many Wounds
your character gets from the attack.
In either system, when your character has no more Body Points or
Wounds left, she’s toast.

Improving Rolls
In addition to scores for a character’s attributes and skills, she has
Fate Points and Character Points. You can spend these points in particularly diﬃcult and heroic situations.
When you spend a Character Point, you get to roll one extra die
when you character tries to complete a task. You may choose to spend
a Character Point after you’ve made a roll (in case you want to improve
your result).

When you spend a Fate Point, that means your character is using
all of her concentration to try to succeed. You may spend a Fate Point
only before any die rolls are made. Doing so doubles the number of
dice you’d normally roll, usually for one round and one action only,
though the gamemaster may allow players to spend more Fate Points
in particularly challenging moments. This allows the character to do
one action really well.
Once a Character Point or Fate Point is used, it’s gone. You gain
more Character Points at the end of a game for completing goals and
playing well. You may get back Fate Points at the end of the game if
they were used at a brave, heroic, or climactic moment.

Try It Out!
Now that you have the basics down, let’s try out a short scenario.
First, you’ll need a character. On the next page, you’ll ﬁnd a template.
Most of the game characteristic information is ﬁlled in. The attributes
and skills are listed in two columns on the left-hand side of the page.
The attributes names — Reﬂexes, Coordination, Physique, Presence,
Knowledge, Perception, and Extranormal — are printed in bold above
the skill names. There are more skills in the game than the ones listed
on this sheet, but these are the ones commonly associated with the type
of profession this template is supposed to represent.
On the far left column, below the gray line at the bottom, you’ll
ﬁnd “Strength Damage.” This shows how much harm your character
can cause with brute force.
Right next to those, in the center column below the gray line, are
some more characteristics. Fate Points and Character Points show
the number of these special roll-improving bonuses your character
currently has. Funds is a measure of how much wealth your character
can usually get at. Below that is “Move.” This characteristic lists the
number of meters your character can easily walk in ﬁve seconds. This
quick encounter doesn’t require using any of these.
In the far right column, you’ll see Advantages, Disadvantages,
Special Abilities, and a description of your character. These give you
an idea about the kind of character that you’re playing. The equipment
paragraph lists the items your character can use during the game.
Below that are Body Points, Wound levels, and the related Body
Point ranges for your character. Each of these represents how much
injury your character can take. This short adventure won’t use Wounds
or the Body Points range, so you can ignore them. Instead, you only
need to use your Body Points number.
Now that you can ﬁnd your way around a character template, let’s
ﬁll in the missing game characteristics. To keep it easy, pick seven skills
that you want your character to have experience or training in. Look at

the die code next to the attribute that the ﬁrst skill is listed under, and
add one to the number in front of the “D.” Write this new die code
next to the skill. Do this for each of the seven skills you picked.
Example: If you decided to put 1D in climbing, your score for
climbing would be your Reﬂexes score plus one, or 4D+1.
Then ﬁll in the top of the sheet, if you’d like, with your character’s
name and other details.
In addition to your character sheet, you’ll need a pencil and some
six-sided dice, one of which should be a diﬀerent color or size than
the others. This special die is your Wild Die. As you go through this
scenario, don’t read the sections in order. Instead, start with number
1, make a selection, and read the section where your selection tells you
to go. Keep doing that until you get to section 16, which is the end.
Then you’ll be ready for your ﬁrst D6 adventure!

An Ordinary Day
1
The crisp breeze on this bright day tugs at your jacket as you stroll
through the streets of a town that looked interesting enough to stop in
on your way across the country. As you read the titles of some novels
on display, you hear a harsh voice say, “Your money or your life!” A
quick glance reveals no one standing near you, so it must have been...
from the alleyway a meter or so to your left. What do you do?
• If you ignore it and walk in the other direction, go to 4.
• If you move quickly to the alley’s entrance and look in, go to 12.

2
You rolled a Critical Failure on the Wild Die. Take away the one
and your highest number. Read the result on the remaining die, and
add any pips if your Perception die code included them. (If you’re using
the Aspiring Hero sample character, then you add a 1 to the number
on the die.)
• Go to 5.

3
You seemed to have convinced the man. His shoulders sag, and he
edges around you and onto the sidewalk. As soon as he’s out of the
alleyway, he bolts down the street.
• Go to 14.

4
Considering that your character’s occupation is “aspiring hero,” you
might ﬁnd it easier to reach that goal if you move closer to trouble.
Go back to section 1 and pick the other option. You’ll also be able to
learn more about how the game works if you do that.
• Go to 1.

5
The mugger is quicker on his feet than he looks. Before you can
react, he rushes forward to punch you. His wild swing connects with
your stomach, causing you to stagger a step. Let’s ﬁnd out how much
that’s going to hurt. Your ability to resist damage, called your damage

resistance total, equals the Armor Value of any protection you’re wearing (like your coat) plus any other modiﬁers. Since there are no other
modiﬁers, your damage resistance total equals 1 (which is the Armor
Value of the coat). Your adversary did four points of damage with his
ﬁst. So, the total amount of injury you take equals the tough’s damage
total minus your damage resistance total, or three points. Subtract three
points from the total number of Body Points you have.
That’s not even enough to knock the wind out of you. Now it’s
your turn.
• If you want to talk him out of hurting the woman, go to 7.
• If you think he’ll only listen to force, go to 9.

6
You rolled a Critical Success on the Wild Die. Add the 6 to the
total of the other dice, and roll only the Wild Die again. As long as
you get a 6 on the Wild Die, keep adding that 6 to the total and roll
the die again. If you get any other number – even a 1 – simply add
that number to the total you already have. (If you’re using the Aspiring
Hero sample character, then you add a 1 to the ﬁnal total.)
• Go to 10.

7
“Come on,” you tell the young man. “Why don’t you step out of
the alley and leave the woman alone before a police oﬃcer comes by.
You really don’t want to spend a night in jail, right? It’d really cut into
your bar time.”
Look at your character sheet and ﬁnd charm or persuasion. If you put
extra dice in either of these, look at the die code next to the skill name.
If you didn’t, then look at the die code of their governing attribute,
Presence. Take a number of dice equal to the number in front of the “D”
of whichever one you’re using; make sure one of those dice is the Wild
Die. Roll the dice. If the Wild Die is a 1, take it away as well as the
highest die and add the rest of them. If the Wild Die is a 6, add the 6,
reroll the Wild Die, and keep adding and rerolling as long you get a 6
(otherwise, just add the number to the rest of the total). If it’s anything
else on the Wild Die, add together the results of all of the dice.
• If the total on the dice is greater than or equal to 15, go to 3.
• If the total on the dice is less than 15, go to 15.

8
You give him a quick and sharp jab on the jaw. The young man’s
eyes go wide, and he decides that this purse is not worth the hassle.
He pushes quickly past you and runs down the street.
• Go to 14.

9
Some people can be reasoned with, and others need a tap on their
craniums to get their attention. Look at your character sheet and ﬁnd
brawling. If you put extra dice in this skill, look at the die code next to
the skill name. If you didn’t, then look at the die code of the governing
attribute, Reﬂexes. Take a number of dice equal to the number in front
of the “D” of whichever one you’re using; make sure one of those dice
is the Wild Die. Roll the dice. If the Wild Die is a 1, take it away as

Introduction
well as the highest die and add the rest of them. If the Wild Die is a
6, add the 6, reroll the Wild Die, and keep adding and rerolling as
long you get a 6 (otherwise, just add the number to the rest of the
total). If it’s anything, else on the Wild Die, add together the results
of all of the dice.
• If the total on the dice is greater than or equal to 5, go to 8.
• If the total on the dice is less than 5, go 13.

10
You’re a little quicker at assessing the situation than the mugger
is. You get the chance to do something before he can react. What do
you want to do?
• If you want to talk him out of hurting the woman, go to 7.
• If you think he’ll only listen to force, go to 9.

11
Since you didn’t get a 1 or 6
on the Wild Die, simply total the
dice and add any pips if your Perception die code included them.
(If you’re using the Aspiring Hero
character, then you add a 1 to the
total on the dice.)
• If the Perception total is greater
than or equal to 6, go to 10.
• If the Perception total is less
than 6, go to 5.

12
You rush over to the alleyway to
ﬁnd a young man in a brown corduroy jacket, green turtleneck, and blue
jeans threatening an old lady, who’s
tightly clutching her large black purse.
He whirls at your footsteps and growls,
“Go away. Me and my grandma were
havin’ a talk.”
You don’t believe that for moment;
you’re going to have to do something
about this. First, let’s ﬁnd out who’s
got the faster reactions in this combat
encounter. Look at your character sheet
and ﬁnd “Perception” and the die code
next to it. Take a number of dice equal
to the number in front of the “D”; make
sure one of those dice is the Wild Die
(and diﬀerently colored from the rest). So, if the die code is 3D+1, you
would have two regular dice and one Wild Die. Roll the dice and then
select the option that matches the results on the Wild Die.
• If you rolled a 1 on the Wild Die, go to 2.
• If you rolled a 6 on the Wild Die, go to 6.
• If you rolled any number other than a 1 or a 6, go to 11.

•

13
The young man must have anticipated your move, because he steps
out of the way just as your ﬁst is about to connect with his face. “You
gonna be that way, you have her!” he snaps as he shoves you. He bolts
out of the alley and down the street.
• Go to 14.

14
The woman leans against the building wall, shaken but otherwise
unhurt. When you oﬀer to take her to a café just across the street, she
gladly accepts. As you walk the little old lady across the road, you think
that it was nice to have a quiet day for a change.
• Go to 16.

15
He sneers at your ridiculous statement, and he rushes forward to punch
you. His wild swing connects with your
stomach, causing you to stagger a step.
Let’s ﬁnd out how much that’s going
to hurt. Your ability to resist damage,
called your damage resistance total,
equals the Armor Value of any protection you’re wearing (like your coat)
plus any other modiﬁers. Since there
are no other modiﬁers, your damage
resistance total equals 1 (which is
the Armor Value of the coat). The
mugger did four points of damage
with his ﬁst. So, the total amount
of injury you take equals your
adversary’s damage total minus
your damage resistance total,
or three points. Subtract three
points from the total number of
Body Points you have. That’s not
even enough to knock the wind
out of you.
As you’re recovering, he
pushes past you and onto the
sidewalk. Without looking back,
he takes oﬀ down the street.
• Go to 14.

16
In a full-length adventure, you’d have a lot more choices, but hopefully, this short adventure gave you an idea of how the game works. If
you’re unsure, go back through the scenario, picking diﬀerent answers
and, probably, making diﬀerent die rolls. When you think you’re ready,
you can use the Aspiring Hero character to play in other adventures
with your friends or you can go to Chapter 1 and learn how to make
your own character. Happy adventuring!

Key Terms
These deﬁnitions provide you with a general idea of what each term
means; they are described in more detail within the book. Terms italicized
within each deﬁnition refer to another entry within this glossary.
action: A task that the character undertakes or something that the
character does, like give a speech or climb a wall.
active defense value: A number the character gets when concentrating on getting out of the way of an attack.
Armor Value: A die code representing the amount of protection a
defensive covering provides. It can help determine the damage resistance
total. This term is sometimes abbreviated AV.
Body Points: The amount of injury a character can sustain, listed
as a number. The damage total is subtracted from the character’s current Body Point total.
Character Point: A bonus representing a surge of adrenaline or
that extra luck the main characters of a story seem to have. Allows the
user to roll an additional Wild Die.
combat diﬃculty: A number representing how challenging it is to
attack someone or something. It equals the active defense value or the
passive defense value.
complementary skill: A skill whose results could beneﬁt from the
use of another skill.
creation points: Points used when designing a character to purchase
die codes in game characteristics or other features that represent the
character’s abilities, experience, and background.
Critical Failure: A result, represented by a 1, on the Wild Die that
indicates something bad has occurred.
Critical Success: A result, represented by a 6, on the Wild Die that
indicates something good has happened. Generally, the player adds
the 6 to the current total and rolls again, adding and rerolling as long
as a 6 comes up.
D (as in “1D”): An abbreviation for “six-sided dice.” The number
in front of the “D” lets you know how many six-sided dice to roll.
damage resistance total: A number that indicates how much injury
a character or object can absorb, soak, or deﬂect.
damage total: A number representing how much injury or destruction something has caused.
defaulting to an attribute: Using the die code for an attribute when
the character doesn’t have a higher die code in the needed skill.
die code, score: The number of six-sided dice players roll (1D, 2D,
3D, 4D, 5D, etc.), and sometimes an amount (called pips) of “+1” or
“+2” that is added to the total result that came up on the dice. “Die
code” and “score” are used interchangeably.
diﬃculty: A number representing how challenging it is to perform
an action.

Fate Point: A bonus representing that a character is using all of
her concentration to try to succeed. Allows the player to, at least,
double the number of dice on one roll. Sometimes the gamemaster
will provide other beneﬁts.
free action: Any action that takes only a few seconds to perform or
do, such as take a few steps or a quick glance around a room.
modiﬁer: A number or die code that is added or subtracted from
another number or die code to represent a change in the typical situation.
opposed diﬃculty, opposed roll: A diﬃculty that applies when one
character resists another character’s action. In this case, both characters
roll die codes related to the activity and compare them.
passive defense value: A number representing a character’s innate
ability to get out of the way of danger. It usually equals 10.
pip: An added bonus to the total result that came up on the dice.
A “+1” means one is added to the total, while “+2” means two is
added.
range (in combat): The distance from the attacker to the target.
result points: The diﬀerence between the total rolled with an
attribute’s or skill’s die code and the diﬃculty of an action.
result point bonus: Usually, one-half (rounded up) of the result
points ﬁgured for an action. It sometimes may be used to aﬀect other
rolls.
round: A unit of time equal to ﬁve seconds in the game world.
Figuring out what happens in a round can take longer.
scale: A game mechanic representing that opponents of vastly different sizes can aﬀect each other diﬀerently in combat.
standard diﬃculty: A number, generally selected from a chart,
assigned to an action based on how challenging it is.
Strength Damage: A die code representing the amount of harm a
character can do because of his or her physical prowess.
Toughness: A die code representing the amount of damage an object
can take, similar to a character’s Physique attribute.
unskilled modiﬁer, untrained modiﬁer: A modiﬁer added to
an action’s diﬃculty that represents the increased diﬃculty of doing
something without the right training or experience. The terms are
used interchangeably.
Wild Die: A six-sided die, of a diﬀerent color or size from other
dice used, that represents the randomness of life, with the 1 and the 6
indicating a special result (see Critical Failure and Critical Success).
Wounds: The amount of injury a character can sustain, listed as a
level. The level is determined by comparing the diﬀerence between the
damage total and the damage resistance total to a chart.

CHAPTER ONE

Character Basics
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter covers three methods of character creation and provides an overview of the attributes and skills available to characters.
If you’ve made a character already, skip past “Character Creation” to
“Attributes” and skim the rest of the chapter, adjusting your character
if necessary.

Character Creation Methods
To make a character, you’ll need to select a template from within this
book or another D6 game, or make your own. A blank character sheet
also is included at the end of this book. You can either photocopy your
chosen sheet, or copy the information onto a separate sheet of paper.
You also can download free the templates and character sheet at the
West End Games Web site, www.westendgames.com.

Templates
A few starting character templates have been provided at the end of
this book. (For information on reading the template, see “Try It Out!”
on page 4). To get started right away, pick one and distribute seven
skill dice among the skills listed; the dice for attributes have already
been done for you. Note that the listed skills are the ones that type of
character might typically have, though you could include others not
on the list if you’d like.
For skill descriptions and details on how to distribute skill dice, see
the “Skills” section later in this chapter.
If desired, you can ﬁll in the other character features (such as gender,
age, and so on) and provide any additional notes on the character’s
history. There is no need to purchase equipment, as that has already
been ﬁgured for the characters.
If you choose a template from another D6 game, you may need
to make some adjustments in the types of skills that a character based
on that might have. Check the list herein to make sure the template’s
skills are described in this D6 version. If one is not, either cross it oﬀ
the template or substitute a similar skill that does exist.
Once you have ﬁnished ﬁlling in your template, you’re ready to
play or you can skip to the “Game Basics” chapter and read more on
how to use your new character.

Deﬁned Limits
If you wish to make your own starting character from scratch,
without a template but with deﬁned limits on what can be put into
attributes and skills, use these guidelines. This chapter describes each

characteristic in more detail, including examples on how you can split
the dice.
These guidelines assume you’ll make a normal Human character.
If not, talk with your gamemaster about the minimums, maximums,
and other requirements for the character species you want to use. See
the various sections in this chapter for details on dice distribution and
ﬁguring out other aspects of your character.
Attributes: Distribute 18 dice among the seven attributes. The
minimum is 1D and the maximum is 5D in all attributes except
Extranormal attributes. Extranormal attributes have no minimum and
no maximum.
Skills: Distribute seven dice among the skills. The maximum number
of dice added to any one skill is 3D.
Move: This equals 10 meters per round.
Body Points: If your gamemaster is using this characteristic, roll your
character’s Physique and add 20 to the total. Ignore this characteristic
if your gamemaster is only using Wounds.
Wounds: If your gamemaster is using the Wound levels option
with Body Points, see the appropriate table in the “Damage and Body
Points” chapter to determine the range of Body Points associated with
each Wound level. If your gamemaster is only using Wounds, you don’t
need to ﬁgure out the Body Points range; you can put a line through
that column if you’d like.
Strength Damage: Drop the pips from your character’s Physique

code), divide the number by 2, and round up. This is the Strength

Funds: All characters start with a base Funds die code of 3D. Look
under “Funds” in this chapter for modiﬁers to this roll and how to
convert this number to cash.
Character Points: Characters start with ﬁve Character Points.
Fate Points: Characters start with one Fate Point.
For equipment, Advantages, Disadvantages, Special Abilities,
background, and character features, see the appropriate sections in this
chapter for more details on how to ﬁll out these optional sections.

Creating Experienced or Existing Characters
If you are making an experienced character, you’ll need to ﬁgure out
how much more experience that character has than a novice character.
Using the initial novice totals of seven skill dice, ﬁve Character Points,
and one Fate Point, add 15 skill dice, 15 Character Points, and two
Fate Points to the initial totals for each year the character has been
a full-time active adventurer. (For part-timers, halve these ﬁgures,
rounding up.) If you are creating a character based on an existing
ﬁctional character, ignore these limits and add dice in whatever skills
as seems reasonable.

Creation Point Pool
Those who wish to use points to create their characters, rather than
following a template or being restricted in what they can put in skills
and attributes, can use a point system. Each novice character receives
79 creation points to distribute among all the options. Players may
only spend creation points as whole points, not fractions.
• One attribute die equals four creation points.
• One skill die equals one creation point.

• Three skill specialization dice equal one creation point.
• Advantages and Special Abilities have their own costs associated
with them; see the “Character Options” chapter for details.
Other restrictions apply:
• Attributes have a minimum of 1D and a maximum of 5D, except
in Extranormal attributes.
• The maximum starting number of dice that may be added to any
one skill or specialization of skill is 3D.
Players of Human characters may add up to 10 additional creation
points to their totals by taking an appropriate number of ranks in Disadvantages. Non-Human species may have their own creation points
totals, maximum number of points of Disadvantages, and starting
Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities.
All novice characters also start with ﬁve Character Points and one
Fate Point.
For more experienced characters or for worlds involving more Special
Abilities, gamemasters should feel free to raise the number of starting
creation points and the number of creation points received from Disadvantages. For example, experienced gamemasters may wish to allow
experienced players to created starting characters who’ve actually been
around for a while. Using the initial novice totals of 79 creation points,
ﬁve Character Points, and one Fate Point, add 15 creation points, 15
Character Points, and two Fate Points to the initial totals for each year
the character has been a full-time active adventurer. (For part-timers,
halve these ﬁgures, rounding up.) Unless the gamemaster decides otherwise, there are no maximums for skills and Disadvantages.
Players basing their characters on existing ﬁctional entities should
ignore the skill and Disadvantage limits and, with their gamemaster’s
approval, create the character distributing dice as best reﬂects how the
character appears in his, her, or its stories.
For characteristics other than attributes and skills, refer to the
“Deﬁned Limits” section, starting with “Move.”

Attributes
Each character has seven attributes, which measure basic physical
and mental abilities that are common to every living creature (and
some nonliving things), no matter what universe or dimension they
exist in.
Reﬂexes: Measure of balance, limberness, quickness, and full-body
motor abilities.
Coordination: Measure of hand-eye coordination and ﬁne motor
abilities.
Physique: Measure of physical power and ability to resist damage.
Knowledge: Measure of strength of memory and ability to learn.
Perception: Measure of mental quickness and attention to detail.
Presence: Measure of emotional strength, physical attractiveness,
and personality.
Extranormal: Measure of a character’s extraordinary abilities, which
could include psionics, magic, or other extranormal talents. It is often
listed by its type, rather than by the term “Extranormal.” Most characters
begin with a score of 0D, since people with such abilities are extremely
rare. Those who have an Extranormal attribute must decide how it’s
manifested. Characters almost never have more than one Extranormal

Example: Your character’s Physique is 3D+1. If you wanted her to
be a little better in the lifting skill, you could add one pip to the base
attribute to get a lifting skill score of 3D+2. If you decided to add two
pips to the base attribute, the lifting score becomes 4D.
You can also specialize in skills. Specializations reﬂect a greater
familiarity in a particular area covered by a base skill. One skill die
equals three specialization dice. Of course, one specialization die still
equals three pips.
You don’t need to have any extra dice in the base skill in order to
take a specialization in that skill, but when you give your character
specializations in that manner, they are treated as separate skills. If you
give your character specializations in base skills he already has, those
specializations are considered bonuses to the base skill when attempting tasks of that type.
Once you’ve chosen at least one specialization and put one or two
pips or dice in it, you have to use the remaining specialization dice
and pips to either purchase more pips in the same specialization or
purchase one or more pips in other specializations.
You roll the specialization’s die code only when you use the speciﬁc item
or knowledge reﬂected by the specialization. Otherwise, you roll the base
skill (or attribute if you didn’t put additional dice in the full skill).

attribute. Magic and Psionics are two Extranormal attributes described
in this book.
When you put dice in an attribute, you can either put whole dice
in each attribute, or you can give each a mixture of whole dice and
pips. Each die equals three pips.
Example: You’ve distributed most of your attribute dice, but you
have four dice left to put in Perception and Presence. You could put 1D
in Perception and 3D in Presence, or 2D+1 in Perception and 1D+2 in
Presence, or some similar combination.
Extranormal is the only attribute in which a Human character may
have no dice; there is no maximum that a Human character may have
in this attribute. No Human character may have less than 1D or more
than 5D in any other attribute. Other species have other minimums
and maximums, which are either listed with the species description or
speciﬁed by the gamemaster.

Skills
Skills are more speciﬁc applications of an attribute. For example, the
skill dodge is a more speciﬁc use of your character’s Reﬂexes. Characters
learn them through instruction or experience.
Skills are areas of knowledge that are not necessarily common to
every living creature. Some creatures simply don’t have the capacity
to learn certain skills.
All skills beneath a given attribute begin at that attribute’s die code.
To highlight skills in which the character has trained or has some
experience, add pips or dice to the base attribute value.
As with attributes, when creating your character, you can either put
whole dice in each skill, or you can give each a mixture of whole dice
and pips. Remember that each die equals three pips.

Example: If your character’s Knowledge is 3D and her demolitions
is 3D+2, you could give her a demolitions specialization of vehicles of
+1 (which means that, when she’s attempting to blow up vehicles, she
rolls four dice). You would then have two specialization dice and two
specialization pips to place among other specializations. With these,
you could further improve her demolitions: vehicles specialization, or
you could pick one or more other specializations in the same or other
base skills.
A character may not put dice in any skill associated with the
Extranormal attribute unless that character already has dice in that
attribute.
The maximum number of dice the character may start with in any
base skill is 3D greater than the governing attribute, with no more than
3D greater than the base skill in any specialization.
You can ﬁnd the list of skills and their descriptions on the next
two pages.

Advantages, Disadvantages, and
Special Abilities
Advantages and Disadvantages are beneﬁts or quirks your character
has developed. Some aﬀect the character’s attributes and skills, while
others serve as useful roleplaying tools for rounding out the character.
Special Abilities are unusual talents or powers the character has that are
outside the norm for Humans. The next chapter, “Character Options,”
discusses these characteristics. You may ignore this section if you don’t
want to add them to your character.

Move
This number (usually 10) represents how many meters your character
moves in a round at maximum walking speed in standard (1 g) gravity.
(The running skill can increase this rate. It also serves as the base for
other movement skills.)

strike: The ability to psychically cause injury.
telekinesis: The ability to move things with the mind
.
telepathy: The ability to read thoughts.

Should the character have a diﬀerent sort of movement than normal
(such as ﬁns for legs), see the Hindrance Disadvantage (described in
the “Character Options” chapter) for information on how to account
for this variability.

Special Points
Players’ characters typically start the game with one Fate Point and
ﬁve Character Points. You can spend these points to improve your
character’s chance of succeeding in especially diﬃcult situations. (The
mechanics of this are discussed in the “Game Basics” chapter.) Character Points alternatively are used to permanently improve skills. Your
character earns more Character and Fate Points by having adventures.
There is no limit to the number of Character or Fate Points your
character may have at any time.

Body Points and Wounds
This section of the character sheet allows you to keep track of the
healthiness of your character. Which you use depends on the gamemaster.

Determining Body Points
When you create a new character, roll his Physique (including any
modiﬁers from Disadvantages or Special Abilities) and add 20. (Treat a 1
that comes up on the Wild Die as a 1 and add it to the total as normal;
it has no negative eﬀect on the result.) This becomes his Body Point
total. Write it on the character sheet in the space provided. Templates
already have their Body Points determined.
Example: Your character has 3D+1 in Physique. You roll three dice,
making sure one of them is the Wild Die. The dice come up 4 and
6, with a 1 on the Wild Die. Since the 1 has no negative eﬀect, you
add the numbers to arrive at a total of 11. You then include the pip
bonus of 1 with this for 12. Finally, you add 12 to 20 to get a Body
Point total of 32.

Determining Wounds
If your gamemaster is using the Wound levels option with Body
Points, see the appropriate table in the “Damage and Body Points”
chapter to determine the range of Body Points associated with each
Wound level. If your gamemaster is only using Wounds, you don’t
need to ﬁgure out the Body Points range; you can put a line through
that column if you’d like.

Strength Damage
Strength Damage indicates the amount of harm a character can
do in combat with body parts, melee weapons, thrown weapons, and
most missile weapons.

Determining Strength Damage
To determine the Strength Damage die code, take the character’s
Physique or lifting (including any die code modiﬁers from Disadvantages
or Special Abilities) and drop the pips. Divide by 2, and round up.

which represents the amount of money the character can get without
too much trouble on a regular basis because of work or investments.
All characters start with a base of 3 in Funds. Use the accompanying
table to adjust this number. Include any modiﬁers to attributes due to
Disadvantages or Special Abilities. The minimum total is 1. The ﬁnal
total becomes the die code in the Funds attribute.
After character creation, a player can increase the Funds attribute by
spending Character Points (using the rules in the “Improving Characters”
chapter) or through bonuses received as adventure rewards.
If the gamemaster prefers to use cash or its equivalent, multiply
the Funds total by a value speciﬁed by the gamemaster (typically the
equivalent of US$150, 150 euros, or 15,000 yen, but gamemasters who
want more accuracy can use a currency converter). This is how much
money the character receives per week for whatever sort of work the
character does or investments the character has.
Example: Your character has 4D in Knowledge, 6D in business, and
+2D in a specialization of business, investing. Starting with 3, you add
to it 1 for your high Knowledge score and 1 for having at least 8D in
business plus a specialization. Your ﬁnal total is 4, which gives you a
Funds score of 5D. If your gamemaster preferred cash, you would start
with a regular income of $750, 750 euros, or 75,000 yen per week.
Using the Funds attribute is discussed in the “Equipment”
chapter.

Equipment
Players of starting characters may select one small weapon and a
little protective gear plus a few tools of their characters’ chosen trade,
unless there is equipment already listed on the template sheet. Some
basic equipment is explained in the “Equipment” chapter; the gamemaster may allow other options.

Background and Character
Features

Example: A character with 3D in Physique has a Strength Damage of
2D. A character with 6D+2 in lifting has a Strength Damage of 3D.

The character sheet provided in this book and most other templates
include spots for your character’s name, career, species, gender, age,
height, weight, and background information. Unless speciﬁed by the
template or your gamemaster allows it, your character’s species is Human.
Everything else in these sections you are free to ﬁll in as you like.

Templates and Strength Damage

Height and Weight

If you added dice to a template’s lifting skill,
you’ll need to adjust the Strength Damage value listed. Use the information
above to correct the number.

CHAPTER TWO

Character Options
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter is for players who want to explore more of their
characters’ possible backgrounds and abilities. After completing basic
character generation in Chapter 1, look through this chapter to “ﬂesh
out” your character’s history and abilities. You’ll ﬁnd interesting gameand story-related options called Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special
Abilities. These suggest the fact that your character might know things,
people, or whatever that aren’t reﬂected by the character’s attributes
and skills. If something inspires you to change your character’s basic
characteristics, feel free to go back and make adjustments.

Expanding the Character Concept
When you ﬁrst created your character, you probably had a character
concept in mind or one was suggested by the template that you used.
Now’s the time to expand the character’s history.
There are several ways you can do this. The easiest is to answer
questions like:
• Where and when was my character born?
• What did my character do as a child?
• What unusual experiences did my character have?
• How did my character become the character he is now?
• What is one of my character’s major goals?
• What was my character doing right before the game begins?
• Why does your character have the skills that he has?
Say your character knows marksmanship and several specializations.
Why? Was the character in the army? A gangster? A member of a secret
paramilitary organization? How were these skills learned? You don’t have
to explain every skill, but try to rationalize any unusual skills (such as
Extranormal skills), as well as skills the character has two dice or more
in (he is really good at those).
There are, of course, other questions you can come up with, though
these are among the most common.
You can jot down notes and you can go back and ﬁll in the gaps
as you go. You can make up the name of the character’s school, the
exact date of birth, and other things as you go along. If you’re stuck
for ideas, read the basic description of the game setting or remember
pertinent books, television shows, and movies — you can develop
ideas based on them.

Peruse the Character Options
You might not want to write a background for your character until
you look at some of the options available to you. Take a look at the

Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities, and see some of the
beneﬁts and drawbacks you can choose for your character. You might
see something you want to work in, and that will help give you ideas
for a background story.

Aliens, Mutants, Fantastic Species
Non-Human characters and monsters have been a staple of roleplaying games since their inception. Zombies, ghosts, space aliens,
and nuclear mutations are all possibilities in a roleplaying game,
depending upon the game setting, as are any other combinations you
can devise.
When creating a species template, every character based on that
species must have certain background Special Abilities, Disadvantages,
and, possibly, Advantages. However, enough points should remain with
which the player may customize the character. Usually, the character
ends up with more options than normal for average person in the game
setting, but fewer than if the player had stuck with Human. (Experienced
members of the species should have more skills and, perhaps, higher
levels of the template’s Special Abilities and Disadvantages.)

Selecting Character Options
Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities make the character
more interesting, more (and less) eﬀective, and more fun to roleplay (if
you do it right). You know the story of your character — here’s what
that story means.
Advantages are perks that the character has because of her status in
society, the people she knows, or something in her background. They
generally do not directly aﬀect attributes or skills.
Disadvantages hamper the character in some way. They might aﬀect
her attributes or skills or they might mean trouble for her in certain

Game Mechanics —

Within the descriptions of several Adv
antages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities, you’ll noti
ce references to game
mechanics that haven’t been explaine
d yet (like the Critical
Failure die result and the names of diﬃ
culty levels). If this is
your ﬁrst time playing a D6 game, you

situations. Both Advantages and Disadvantages make the character
more rounded and more believable.
Special Abilities are those abilities that exceed the natural capabilities of a Human character. The character’s species, some sort of unique
training, or a magical/super-science/cybernetic/other eﬀect might
explain their origin. They give the character a bonus to her attributes
or skills, or they provide her with access to something that the average
Human character can’t do.
Example: You decide to give your character a Special Ability that
provides him with a +1 to one of three combat-related skill totals. If
you don’t have any points to spend on Special Abilities, your character
needs to have some kind of Disadvantage as well. The character might
have to add 1 to the diﬃculty of all interaction-related skill totals, or
you might include a totally unrelated Disadvantage (of comparative
power) — like the character is afraid of the dark and has trouble acting
when in the dark.

Playing Character Options
Every character option in this chapter has its own rules for implementation. There are, if you look hard enough, some nightmarish combinations. If something seems like it is could cause trouble in the game
later on, check with your gamemaster before choosing it. Ultimately,
the gamemaster has ﬁnal say on the choice of all Advantages, Special
Abilities, and Disadvantages, as well as ﬁnal say on the interpretation of
those choices. Players who misuse their character options, particularly
their Disadvantages, may ﬁnd their Advantages or Special Abilities
meeting with some unfortunate accident.

Organization
Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities are listed alphabetically in their respective sections. Advantages and Disadvantages
are further organized into ranks. These ranks are numbered; highernumbered ranks have a more powerful aﬀect on the character. They
are abbreviated R1, R2, R3, R4, and so on.
Special Abilities do not have listed ranks. Instead, the descriptions
give the initial cost for gaining one rank in that ability.
Note: Gamemasters may allow higher ranks of character options
than the examples given here. Players and gamemasters should discuss
the best way to represent their characters’ unique set of traits.

Costs at Character Creation
Each rank in an Advantage or Disadvantage is worth one creation
point (or one skill die, if you’re using deﬁned limits) per number.
Advantages cost creation points, while Disadvantages give you creation
points (or skill dice). Thus, a Rank 1 Advantage costs one point or die,
while a Rank 4 Disadvantages gives you four points or dice.
The cost of one rank of the Special Ability is included in parentheses.
Some Special Abilities, such as Ambidextrous, do not lend themselves
to being taken more than once. Players may also add Limitations to
their Special Abilities, which reduce their eﬀectiveness (and the cost)
or Enhancements, which increase their eﬀectiveness (and the cost);
these are described at the end of this section.

When using templates or deﬁned limits for attributes and skill
dice, players may use skill dice or dice received from Disadvantages
to get Advantages and Special Abilities. Players in games using character creation point pools may use some of the points in their pool
or points gained from Disadvantages to purchase Advantages and
Special Abilities.
A maximum of 10 creation points or 10 skill dice worth of Disadvantages is recommended for any genre.

Using the Additional Creation Points
You may use creation points that you earn from giving your character
Disadvantages to buy Advantages (at their rank cost), more skill dice
(at a rate of one creation point for each skill die), or more attribute dice
(at a rate of four creation points for each attribute die).

Using the Additional Skill Dice
You may spend additional skill dice gained from including Disadvantages in your character to buy Advantages (at their rank cost), add

more skills, or improve attributes (at a rate of four skill dice for each
attribute die).

Disadvantages
Many Disadvantages exist as counterparts to the Advantages or
Special Abilities listed herein. A Skill Bonus Special Ability is the positive end of a Hindrance Disadvantage. Some have roleplaying eﬀects,
while others alter attributes and skills.
When choosing Disadvantages, keep a few things in mind:
1. You’re going to have to live with the Disadvantage. Take only
Disadvantages that you don’t expect to ever get rid of — there are rules
for eliminating Disadvantages, but gamemaster may allow their use
only after lots of adventuring.
2. Choose more roleplaying Disadvantages than game mechanic
ones. Instead of taking easy-to-use modiﬁers to skill attempts or abilities,
select Disadvantages that you can roleplay. Granted, you won’t want
to have an overwhelming number of either type of Disadvantage, but
Disadvantages that can be roleplayed and can work themselves into

Chapter 2

Page 18

an adventure story are much more interesting than simple modiﬁers
to diﬃculty numbers.
3. The Disadvantage has to be a disadvantage. Any Disadvantage that can be easily worked around, no matter how potent, or that
actually helps the character on a regular basis is not a Disadvantage.
For example, if a character has an Advantage Flaw where he can’t use
his Advantage when the temperature is below 60, and the character
is always adventuring in places where the temperature is at least that
high, then it is not a Disadvantage. Check all Disadvantages (and other
character options, for that matter) with your gamemaster and explain
to him what you think they mean before you start playing the game.
That way, you can avoid this problem before it crops up. Gamemasters
who ﬁgure out the player was purposely trying to break the system
may take away the Disadvantage and an equal amount of Advantages,
Special Abilities — maybe even Character and Fate Points.

Achilles’ Heel (R3)
The character has a particular serious weakness. It is not something
that most other characters ﬁnd especially dangerous or inconvenient,
but the character suﬀers severe modiﬁers to diﬃculties or even damage
when exposed to it. Some examples include:
Allergy: The character is strongly aﬀected by reasonably common
things that she cannot always avoid. When exposed to the allergen, the
character must generate a Moderate Physique or stamina total (as an
action) or she takes 3D in damage. The character can resist the damage
through applicable defenses, but she has to generate the stamina total
as an action every round she is exposed to the allergen.
Atmospheric Incompatibility: The character is sensitive to
something in the normal atmosphere and must shield himself from
it. Failure to do so causes him to take a -4 modiﬁer to his damage
resistance total or the character takes a +1 modiﬁer to all diﬃculties
(which increases by +1 per minute exposed) until the character is out
of the harmful situation.
Example: The high quantity of carbon monoxide produced by some
combustion engines may poison a plant creature. When in the presence
of these engines (such as when in a big city where these sorts of engines
are used), the character must have an “air ﬁlter” on at all times.
Cultural Allergy: The same as above, but there is some social situation that causes the character to freeze (exposure to nudity, the sight
of police, etc.) and lose all Critical Success rerolls until the condition
is gone.
Environmental Incompatibility: The character is sensitive to
something in the environment: an extreme of temperature, the chemical
content of rain water, etc. Exposure to this without the proper protection causes the character to take -4 modiﬁer to his damage resistance
total or the character takes a +1 modiﬁer to all diﬃculties (which
increases by +1 per minute exposed) until the character is out of the
harmful situation.
Metabolic Diﬀerence: The character needs more life support
(typically food) than “normal” and begins to take damage after hours
of malnutrition. For every hour after the speciﬁed time frame, the
character’s damage resistance total is modiﬁed by -1, which cannot

be recovered except by obtaining the additional life support — and
making up for the skipped amounts. For food, the character eats the
equivalent of twice as many meals per day as the average Human. For
instance, the character must eat a meal every four hours or, every hour
after the four are up, the character’s damage resistance total goes down.
As another example, three times per day, a diﬀerent character may need
to eat twice as much as a normal Human.
Nutritional Requirements: The character must ingest an element
not commonly consumed by Humans (blood, dead Human ﬂesh, etc.)
to survive. Often, the character encounters prejudice because of this,
and she certainly develops physical problems if she fails to consume
this substance in a reasonable amount of time.
Rot: The character’s body is rotting. She periodically loses pieces of
herself (such as ﬁngers and toes) and must pause to fuse them back on
(this is a simple action but takes a round to perform). The character suffers no damage from this, but it should inconvenience her. For instance,
in combat, the character’s ﬁngers might fall oﬀ, causing her to drop her
weapon — this makes an excellent Critical Failure complication.
Vulnerability: A particular form of attack or interaction aﬀects the
character much more severely than other characters. For example, a
character with a vulnerability to ﬁrearms might “freeze up” when he
sees another character point a gun at him — making the other character +5 to hit him (most likely during the ﬁrst round of combat only).
Another character might automatically apply +10 to the diﬃculty of
any attempts to resist another character’s con attempts. (The less likely
the situation is to occur, the greater the diﬃculty modiﬁer.)

Character Options
Restrictions/Notes: The Achilles’ Heel (R3) should be very serious,
but not “instant death” for the character. There should always exist
some way to avoid it (not easily), or some chance that the character
can counter it. The more creative the Achilles’ Heel (R3), and the
more likely it aﬀects the character, the less it actually should do. A
character who is vulnerable to water (he probably has a phobia), for
example, might “panic” and suﬀer +3 to the diﬃculty of all actions
when exposed to a large body of water, +5 when in it, and +3 when
wet. Or, the character might just take 3D in damage every time he gets
a signiﬁcant portion of his body wet.

Achilles’ Heel (R4)
The character’s weakness is even more severe than the Rank 3 version
of this Disadvantage. Some examples include:
Allergy: The same rules apply as for Allergy, save that the character
cannot perform any actions except running away while exposed to
the allergen.
Cultural Allergy: The same rules apply as for Cultural Allergy
(R3), save that not only does the character lose all Critical Success
rerolls if exposed to the speciﬁed social situations, she also is at +1 to
all diﬃculties.
Atmospheric or Environmental Incompatibility: The modiﬁer
to the damage resistance total goes up, or the condition is more likely
to occur, or the modiﬁer increases each round.
Rot: The character loses major parts of his body periodically due
to rotting (such as limbs) and must pause to replace them. Doing so
requires no skill total but does take three rounds to perform. The trigger that causes this to take eﬀect should occur no less frequently than
a Critical Failure during combat and interaction rounds.
Symbiosis: The character is bound symbiotically to another, drawing
strength or energy from her. Symbiosis can be either physical or mental.
For every 100 meters by which one character is separated from the
other, the character loses one pip (cumulative) to either their physical
attributes or their mental attributes. (Remember: three pips equal one
die.) If the character’s symbiote is killed, the character loses 1D from the
attributes aﬀected until she can convince another character to willingly
bond with her (the bonding process should be simple — like sharing
blood — but willing participants must want it to happen). For an extra
rank in this Disadvantage, the character is bound both mentally and
physically to another, and loses from both sets of attributes if separated.
For the separation to equally aﬀect the “host,” he must also have this
version of the Achilles’ Heel Disadvantage.
Restrictions/Notes: Additional ranks of the Achilles’ Heel
Disadvantage indicate even more deadly situations. See
Achilles’ Heel (R3) for other notes.

Advantage Flaw (R1)
This Disadvantage is linked to a particular
Advantage or set of skills. Whenever the character
uses it, there is some a chance for a negative
modiﬁer or roleplaying disadvantage. Here
are some examples for certain Advantages:

•

Page 19

Contacts: The Contact helps the character, but he is either “annoying” about it or a “hard bargainer.” Where a normal Contact would
assist the character for an almost negligible fee, the Flawed Contact
will haggle and nag until “rewarded.” Some reason should exist why
the character would want to keep the contact happy.
Cultures: When the character gets hints or knowledge about a culture,
he knows everything except some sort of critical piece of information.
Or, if the character has the “sweeping knowledge” of lots of cultures,
his interpretations sometimes are almost totally wrong (gamemaster
option). In order to make this Flaw work, the character should not
ﬁnd out about the error until it would be “interesting.”
Equipment: In most cases, some sort of minor mechanical imperfection exists in the equipment that no normal means can ﬁx. For
equipment that requires a skill total, gamemasters could either add
3 to the diﬃculty of all actions using it, or, on a Critical Failure, the
equipment either won’t work or malfunctions. For equipment that
wouldn’t normally require a skill total, occasional side eﬀects could
happen or maybe it requires a periodic Moderate skill check of some
kind to keep operating.
Skills: If the character fails at the skill check with one of a set of
three related skills, she can’t reroll Critical Successes either until the
end of the scene or until she succeeds at the skill check.
Wealth or Funds: The character cannot access his wealth easily. Either it is tied up in red tape most of the time (especially if the
character has most of the money invested), or he has to go somewhere
to get it (such as having a fortune back East while adventuring in the
Wild West), or someone else (reasonably friendly) has control over it
and doesn’t always release it easily.
Restrictions/Notes: In general, at Rank 1, a ﬂaw should not debilitate a character or take away his Advantage on a regular basis — but
it should make it a little less of a sure thing.

Advantage Flaw (R2)
This Disadvantage works in exactly the same manner as Advantage
Flaw (R1), above, but with more serious results. If the Flaw came into
play occasionally (like every time the character visited a desert), it now
comes into play much more frequently (like when he is in any dry
environment). If the Flaw made things a little more diﬃcult, then the
Flaw makes things a lot more diﬃcult (the diﬃculty modiﬁer doubles
from the Rank 1 version).
Restrictions/Notes: Having circumstances that eﬀectively take away
the complete beneﬁt of the Advantage is certainly within the bounds of
Advantage Flaw (R2), and those circumstances can occur reasonably
often (no more than during one quarter of a normal adventure,
however). They will force the player to roleplay and to think about
ways to get around the Flaw or to try other options, rather than just
relying on a particular Advantage, Special Ability, or skill set.
Example: If a character has a set of skills with the Flaw that they
only work at night — a Rank 2 Flaw if only about a quarter of the
character’s normal adventuring occurs during the daytime — that
would force the character to rely on other abilities and his wits during the daytime.

Chapter 2

•

Page 20

The rules for Advantage Flaw (R2) are otherwise the same as
Rank 1.

Advantage Flaw (R3)
This rank takes on some of the characteristics of an Achilles’ Heel
(R3), but more in direct relationship to an Advantage, an attribute, or
a large set of skills. The rules for the ﬂaw are the same as for Advantage
Flaw (R2), but the eﬀects are even more severe. Not only does the
character lose the beneﬁts of the Advantage or attribute (or undergoes
a condition that essentially negates it), but he also suﬀers an additional
Disadvantage.
Example: Your character has this Disadvantage attached to her Psionics attribute.
Every time she uses her psionic abilities, she
taps into the general mood of the people
around her. If the people near the psionic
are feeling strong or negative emotions,
the character gets a nasty headache, causing her to immediately loses the ability
to use her mental powers and she can’t
reroll any Critical Successes until the
end of the scene.
Example: A character has Equipment
(R3) — a really powerful weapon. But,
whenever the character suﬀers a Critical Failure using the weapon, the gun
not only runs out of ammo, but the
character experiences some sort of
feedback at a moderate damage total
(maybe the weapon’s normal damage minus a speciﬁc amount). The
character then has to recharge the
weapon (either through the use of
a Price Disadvantage or by waiting
until a major break in the adventure’s
action, most likely).
Some other examples:
Infection: Under certain circumstances, the character passes along
select abilities and characteristics to another character. The character
has an infection score of Physique +2D. (This is not a skill and players
may not raise except by taking additional ranks in this version of the
Disadvantage.)
The gamemaster and the player should determine how the character
spreads the infection. It could happen as the side eﬀect of an attack,
through physical contact, or through some other means. When the
character performs the requisite action, he generates an infection total
(which does not count as a separate action). The target generates a
Physique or stamina total as well (which does not count as an action). If
the character’s infection total exceeds (not equal to) the target’s Physique
or stamina total, the target is infected.
An infection passes certain Special Abilities and Disadvantages
to the target (speciﬁed by the player and the gamemaster when the
player gives the character this Disadvantage). It is possible for the

infection to pass more ranks in Disadvantages on than Special Abilities, but is not possible for it to pass more ranks in Special Abilities
than Disadvantages.
Keep in mind that the infected character may well hate the character responsible for his new state, so the infecting character may
have gained an Enemy. In fact, there should exist some overwhelming
reasons why this is actually bad for the infecting character — it is a
Disadvantage, after all.
Gamemasters who do not feel that the Enemy Disadvantage is
enough of a negative could also work in other sorts of Advantage Flaws
as side eﬀects of spreading the infection.
For an extra rank in the Advantage Flaw: Infection
Disadvantage, the infection die
code increases to Physique+4D.
Also, the penalties for infecting
another characters should be
more severe — maybe the character infected then knows things
about the infection character that
will give him an advantage over his
enemy, or perhaps the infecting
character temporarily loses abilities
or attribute pips.
Minor Stigma: There is something that the character cannot do
without performing the “proper rituals” before or after (a ﬁghter whose
cult must “purify” him after killing
someone; a psychic who cannot use
Psionics without special equipment).
Stench: The character smells terrible due to one of his Advantages
or just because he exists. Add 6 to
the diﬃculty of all stealth attempts, as
everyone can smell him coming. This
also aﬀects interaction attempts, giving
them at least a +1 to the diﬃculty.
Restrictions/Notes: Advantage Flaw
(R3) takes a powerful Advantage and turns it into a worse-than-useless
Disadvantage for a comparatively brief period of time. A single Advantage
can have more than one Advantage Flaw, and, if the character wants,
several Flaws, of various ranks, can link to one Advantage. See other
ranks of Advantage Flaw for more information and examples.

Age (R1)
The character is a teenager or just past middle age. And, since this
is a roleplaying game and not real life, he’ll stay that way. In general,
characters who are “too young” often have to roleplay through episodes
where they are not taken seriously, where they are ignored, and where
they have less rights and control than older characters. Those who
are “too old” get treated in much the same way — characters in their
prime often defer to the character, but they also treat the character as
if he were inﬁrm or possibly senile.

Character Options
Restrictions/Notes: In general, the gamemaster should try to treat
the character as if he were “too old” or “too young” and have fun with
it. Game mechanics are seldom required, as good roleplaying can make
things work here, but if they become necessary, add 3 to the diﬃculty of
intimidation and persuasion actions performed by the character that his
age would bother (a young character trying to lead a group of experienced
characters, or an older character trying to convince younger characters
that he is “with it”). A character may only have one version of Age.

Age (R2)
The Disadvantage is the same, only more so. Instead of being a
teenager, the character is a preteen child. Instead of being just past
middle age, the character is old. The roleplaying situations are basically
the same, but the eﬀects are more dramatic.
Restrictions/Notes: An old character receives +1 to the diﬃculty of
physical actions (those that rely on Reﬂexes, Coordination, and Physique)
that require unusual exertion (running, jumping, ﬁghting, etc.). A young
character adds 1 to the diﬃculty of all mental actions (those that use
Knowledge, Perception, or Presence) when attempting to solve “adult”
problems or interact with adults. Players should roleplay both versions
true to type. Two Disadvantages suitable for association with this one
include Reduced Attribute (especially for Age: Old) and Hindrance.
Characters may be “young” or “old” and not take this Disadvantage. Older characters in good shape have no problems jogging,
lifting, ﬁghting, or whatever, and young, intelligent people can often
interact and think just as well — if not better — than adults. This
Disadvantage addresses those characters, young and old, who can’t
keep up as easily.

Bad Luck (R2)
The character is exceptionally unlucky. This Disadvantage is under
the gamemaster’s control most of the time. The easiest way to handle
it is, whenever the player rolls the dice and a Critical Failure comes up,
not only does it take away the highest die in the roll, but something bad
happens. The gamemaster can choose from not allowing the player to
reroll Critical Successes until the end of the scene, the character loses
an action during the next round, or invoking some sort of strange, but
not too terrible, “bad luck eﬀect.”
Example: A character with Bad Luck is running from a group of terrorists that he’s been ﬁghting for some time. He tries to jump across an
elevator shaft when the player rolls a Critical Failure on the dice. Well,
the character probably failed in the jumping attempt (so he falls), but,
instead of being able to grab for a cable or a lower ledge, the character’s
belt gets caught on a hook. Now, the character has to free himself before
the terrorists come around the corner and blow him away.
Restrictions/Notes: A character may take Bad Luck (R2) if he already
has the Good Luck or Great Luck Special Ability. The character might
even, on occasion, use the beneﬁts of the Good Luck or Great Luck
Special Ability to get out of trouble or partially negate the eﬀects of
Bad Luck (R2) — that’s the way it works. Also, the gamemaster should
remember that the character has Bad Luck (R2) — not the player. If
the player gets into a consistent “streak” of rolling Critical Failures on
the dice, then the gamemaster should start “skipping” the invocation

which Luck beneﬁt his cha

of Bad Luck (R2) occasionally — more than three or four occurrences
of Bad Luck (R2) during an adventure is a little much.

Bad Luck (R3)
The rules for this Disadvantage are the same as for Bad Luck (R2).
However, a Critical Failure or a total equal to one more than the die
code of the skill or attribute causes Bad Luck (R3) to activate. (For
example, if the character has 5D in a skill and rolls a total of 6 on the
dice — which is one more than the die code in the skill — the Disadvantage comes into play). The eﬀects are exactly the same, only the
gamemaster might make the setbacks more uncomfortable.
Restrictions/Notes: See Bad Luck (R2).

Bad Luck (R4)
The same as Bad Luck (R2) and Bad Luck (R3), but the character
suﬀers the eﬀects on a Critical Failure or a total equal to or less than
two more than the die code of the skill or attribute. (So, if the character
with a skill of 5D rolls a 6 or 7, then the Disadvantage is activated.)
The minimum eﬀect is that the character loses her actions on the round
and probably something disastrous happens.
Restrictions/Notes: See Bad Luck (R2) and Bad Luck (R3). Since
Bad Luck (R4) can have such devastating eﬀects, the gamemaster might
want to overrule occurrences of it. For example, if, during a standard
scene of an adventure, a character is trying to persuade a shopkeeper
to sell him an item at a better price, he might roll a low total on the
dice. The gamemaster could have something disastrous happen — the
shopkeeper keels over with a heart attack just as the chief of police walks
in and the character is suddenly suspected of murder — but does it
serve any purpose in the adventure? Possibly, but if it doesn’t, save it
until later. Then, when the character is at the climax of the adventure
and he doesn’t roll a disastrously low total — but the gamemaster feels
a “dose of bad luck” would improve the story — he can use that as an
excuse. Players should understand that Bad Luck is arbitrary and will
often occur at the worst possible moment.

Burn-out (R1 or more)
Under a certain set of proscribed circumstances, the Advantage goes
away — permanently. The player and the gamemaster should work
out the circumstances, with the following criteria:

Chapter 2

•

Page 22

1. The Burn-out should have a chance of occurring about once or
twice an adventure.
2. The Burn-out should be something the character can avoid — but
she might not want to avoid it.
3. A logical reason for the Burn-out to occur should exist.
4. Both the player and the gamemaster operate under the knowledge
that the Burn-out will occur at some point.
Some examples of when a Burn-out could occur include:

The character is, in all respects, an alien. Either he’s from another
planet with a completely diﬀerent culture, or whatever ﬁts the game
setting — he just doesn’t ﬁt in (socially, and, most likely, physically).
Otherwise, this Disadvantage works exactly the same way as the other
rank versions.
Restrictions/Notes: See Cultural Unfamiliarity (R1).

Debt (R1)
The character owes money, or something else valuable, to someone.
In most cases, some sort of lending institution or credit house exists,
and the payments aren’t too arduous. The character just has a harder
time getting credit and has to turn over a substantial amount of any
proﬁts he makes on an adventure to the lender.

• An opponent soundly defeats the character in an adventure.
• The character completes a particular mission of great importance
(this would probably only happen after several adventures — but the
character wants to complete for some reason).
• The character suﬀers a particular eﬀect (she loses most of her Body
Points or Wounds, she is the victim of a particular type of uncommon
attack, etc.).
• A character’s Advantage is somehow negated (a Contact who has
a good chance of being killed, a piece of Equipment that someone is
trying to steal or destroy, etc.).

Cultural Unfamiliarity (R3)

This Disadvantage is worth a number of ranks equal to one-half
(rounded up) of the Advantage with which it’s associated.

S

Restrictions/Notes: Any Advantage could have the possibility of
Burn-out. Just think of a logical (or, perhaps, supernatural) reason an
Advantage would go away. There should exist a decent chance that it
could go away, but the character should have some chance of avoiding
that occurrence… for a while.

Cultural Unfamiliarity (R1)

The character is not from the “mainstream” culture of the society he
spends the most time in. The player should decide on the character’s
native country, which is somewhere with a diﬀerent culture than the
one he is normally in. For instance, a character in a real world setting
might hail from India but operate out of the United Kingdom. While
the U.K. does not have any particular dislike of Indians, a few “cultural clashes” might happen occasionally. Bigots might get in the way
of the character, and the character might not always “know” things
about the setting that natives would automatically understand. The
character is an outsider.
Restrictions/Notes: At the worst, gamemasters can treat like Prejudice (R1), but, most often, the character is just unfamiliar with
aspects of the mainstream. Characters cannot usually take
this Disadvantage more than once.

Cultural Unfamiliarity (R2)
The character is of a culture almost totally different from the “mainstream” he operates in. The
character should constantly make mistakes and
social gaﬀs. All attempts at streetwise or similar “getting around town” skills should have +6 to the diﬃculty (at least). In
addition, the character should probably have trouble with the native
language (he could even take the Disadvantage Language Problems).
Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Cultural Unfamiliarity (R1).

Restrictions/Notes: Players should take this Disadvantage if they
intend for their characters to live up to it. The character should have a
reason he doesn’t want to default on the debt, which the player works
out beforehand. Also, Debt (any rank) with Enemy (any rank) can be
an interesting combination — maybe the character is in deep to a loan
shark or a manipulative and not entirely scrupulous lender.
A character may have this Disadvantage with the Advantage Wealth
(any rank), as long as there is some reason it can’t be just paid oﬀ. A
character with Wealth (R3) (phenomenal resources) might be stuck
in a contract where he has to turn over the proﬁts of any adventure to
someone, for example — he still has his wealth, but he has to cough up
all the little neat things and rewards he gets at the end of the adventure
(or the character has to persuade the lender/contract holder to let him
keep them).

Debt (R2)
The character owes a lot of money (or something else valuable) to
someone dangerous, or the results of owing this debt are dangerous.
For example, the character could owe his life to a really strange old
scientist, and, every time that person needs a favor (usually going oﬀ
somewhere dangerous and doing something suicidal), the character
has to drop everything and go.
Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Debt (R1).

Debt (R3)
The character owes almost everything to someone or something. In
the case of worldly goods, the character must turn over nearly everything to the “lender” at the end of an adventure — the character must
“borrow” these things back at the beginning of the next adventure.
And it is up to the gamemaster what the “lender” gives back.
In most cases, this means the character is either Employed or under
some similar sort of restriction.
Example: Your character might belong to a particularly strict cult or
religion. She has to tithe all worldly goods (or, at least, a large portion
of worldly goods) to the cult after every adventure. If she does not, she
would be cast out — a fate she would not enjoy — or even hunted and
killed. At the beginning of each adventure, the character must beg and
persuade whoever is in charge to let her have any goods she needs.

Character Options
Restrictions/Notes: Debt (R3) is so wide-sweeping that players may
not usually combine in it with the lower versions or link to individual
Advantages unless the player and the gamemaster are particularly
inventive. A character with Debt (R3) might “owe” the possession of a
Rank 3 or Rank 4 Advantage to a particular source (a character might
have received Equipment from a supernatural source) and have to pay
some sort of tithe (a sacriﬁce, all the money the character obtains, etc.)
to get the use of the Advantage.

Devotion (R1)
The character feels compelled to take certain actions out of a love
of code or perceived duty to something else. The character may, at
times, do things he ﬁnds morally questionable in order to achieve a
greater good. With Devotion (R1), the character’s beliefs do not come
into play very often.

Devotion (R2)
The character with the Devotion (R2) Disadvantage believes very
strongly in something and will attempt to persuade others of the rightness of his beliefs. His patriotism or loyalty to an ideal plays a role in
his day-to-day life.

Devotion (R3)
At this rank, the character’s belief in the cause motivates almost all
his actions. The character would willingly die for his belief.

Employed (R1)
The character has a job. Maybe the job relates to what the character
wants to do during adventures, or maybe not. Regardless, the character
wants to keep her job (or has to, for some reason), and she must take
responsibility for missing work and fulﬁlling her obligations.
Restrictions/Notes: The player and the gamemaster might have to
work to roleplay this, but an occasional conﬂict should arise between
what the character wants to do and what she has to do. The character
might even have to keep some activities secret or lose her job.
Some examples include special ops for a government or private
organization, bodyguard, mercenary, reporter, writer, ﬁlm maker, private investigator, bounty hunter, and police oﬃcer. The less freedom
the character has in making decisions during the adventure and what
she wants to do during her working hours (and perhaps even her spare
time), the greater the rank in Employed.

Employed (R2)
The character works for someone, or something, that pretty much runs
his life. When he goes on adventures, he either has to go through lots of
red tape to get permission, or it’s because he was assigned the mission.
As a result, the character has little free will regarding what he does or
how he does it, and he should come into conﬂict with his employer on
occasion. Also, since the character is an employee, if he is on a mission,
he usually has to turn over his share of the loot for corporate disposal
— he’ll get something out of it, certainly, but not a full share.
Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Employed (R1).
Just make sure that “the job” is fairly inconvenient for the character, but

•

Page 23

there are reasons he doesn’t quit. Maybe he has the Wealth Advantage
only so long as he has the Employed (R2) Disadvantage — that would
be a good way of tying in the Disadvantage.

Employed (R3)
The character is, for all intents and purposes, a slave. This does
not mean the character is poor or without means — just without free
choice. The character does virtually everything because he must. For
example, a character might be the head of a large corporation. But the
only way things get done is for the character to do them or be there
to oversee their getting done. Adventures only occur when they are in
direct concordance with the interests of the “employer.” In all other
ways, this Disadvantage is like its lower rank versions.
Restrictions/Notes: See Employed under the other ranks.

Enemy (R1)
An individual or group has it in for the character. An Enemy who
is a single person of power and inﬂuence no greater than the character
might actually want the character dead. An Enemy (R1) of power and
inﬂuence greater than the character simply wants to hassle the character for some reason. Maybe in the town the character operates, the
law enforcement authorities have his name and picture on ﬁle — and
they’ll use any excuse to run him in or hassle him because they think
of him as a troublemaker. Or, perhaps, the character’s landlord throws
everything out on the street if he’s one minute late with the rent, or the
character’s boss always assigns him the most boring or most dangerous
missions. The Enemy does not have to have a position in the character’s

Chapter 2

•

Page 24

life — he can just be someone who, for some reason known to the
gamemaster (and probably the player, but not always the character),
has a grudge against the character.
Restrictions/Notes: There is no reason a player can’t use this
Disadvantage similarly to an Advantage Flaw or as a complement to
other Disadvantages or even Advantages. Maybe a character’s Contact
is sweet and helpful (a secretary in the Pentagon who tells the character
a little more about the mission he’s been assigned), but someone who
inﬂuences the Contact is an Enemy (the secretary’s boss who has been
trying to seduce the secretary and resents the fact that the secretary likes
the character better) and sometimes makes it hard for the contact to
help. Enemy (R1) characters should either show up only occasionally
(maybe once during an adventure), or they should be minor annoyances that can only be a real problem if the character doesn’t deal with
them when they show up. Multiple Enemies of various ranks can be
selected (just don’t go overboard).

Enemy (R2)
The rules are the same as for Enemy (R1), only the character is more
powerful, more annoying, and/or more a part of the character’s life.
Restrictions/Notes: It should be mentioned that killing the Enemy
or running away should not get rid of the Disadvantage — at least not
easily. At the very least, the character should have to go though a few
adventures to “remove” the Enemy from his life. Usually, the character
has to deal with the Enemy for quite a long time. Multiple Enemies
can, of course, be selected.

Enemy (R3)
Again, the rules are the same as for Enemy (R1) and Enemy (R2).
Most likely, a group of people or a very powerful person who wishes to
kill or otherwise remove the character from the game setting hounds
the character. They often hurt people she knows and do vile deeds
just because the character won’t like them. The Enemy (R3) should get
involved in, directly or indirectly, most adventures the character goes on.
Just about everything bad that happens to the character would please
the Enemy — and he is probably responsible for a lot of them.
Restrictions/Notes: Enemy (R3) is a very powerful, and very important, Disadvantage. Many beginning gamemasters might not want to
go to the trouble of creating and constantly maintaining a villain or
group of villains relating to the character — but others will enjoy it.
Talk to your gamemaster about this option before you select it.

Hindrance (R1 or more)
The character has a minor physical or mental handicap that makes
certain actions more diﬃcult. The hindrance could be a permanent physical injury, a particular mental block regarding certain types of activities,
a limitation innate to the character’s species, or the result of age.
The player and the gamemaster should work out some sort of
aﬄiction and then choose a group of related skills that get diﬃculty
modiﬁers totaling +3. Some examples of sets of three skills getting a
+1 modiﬁer to the diﬃculty of each include:
Bad Knee: acrobatics, jumping, running
Rude: charm, con, persuasion

Trick Shoulder: climbing, melee combat, throwing
Uncoordinated: acrobatics, melee combat, sleight of hand
Unobservant: investigation, languages, search
The players may use this Disadvantage to restrict one form of their
characters’ movement. A two-meter reduction in one form of movement (running, swimming, jumping, or climbing) is equivalent to a +1
diﬃculty modiﬁer, so a player could take a small movement restriction
along with diﬃculty modiﬁers to skills. The minimum movement rate
for a character is one meter.
Characters with a native environment requiring an alternative means
of movement other than walking (such as swimming or burrowing) may
take one rank of Hindrance: Atypical Move to represent the inability to
walk or jump. Instead, the character uses his base Move to represent his
base swimming or burrowing Move. Thus, a water-dwelling character
without legs and with this type of Hindrance would have a swimming
Move of 10 (instead of 5), could not walk, and would be limited in
the kind of jumping he could perform.
Players who wish to reduce their character’s damage resistance total
(to represent a delicate physical nature) may take a -1 modiﬁer to that
total for each rank in this Disadvantage.
Restrictions/Notes: Players may restrict specializations — with
gamemaster approval. Three specializations that the gamemaster thinks
the player might have to use reasonably often (like investigation: ﬁnd
clues or marksmanship: pistols) could substitute for one general skill.
Hindrance (R1) can be selected several times, as long as the gamemaster
thinks it appropriate. Since it is very much the counterpart to the Skill
Bonus Special Ability, additional restrictions and notes can be related
to the ones found there.
Each additional rank in Hindrance increases the total diﬃculty
modiﬁer by +3, which may aﬀect the few skills in a Rank 1 group, or
they can increase the number of skills covered by the Hindrance.

Illiterate (R1)
A character can be considered Illiterate for one of two reasons. The
ﬁrst is simply due to her inability to read. The other reason is if she did
not speak the local language (an immigrant arriving in a new country
or an explorer among natives, etc.). She may be an extremely intelligent
and well-read person, but she has diﬃculty exhibiting that in her new
country. She receives a +6 diﬃculty modiﬁer in addition to any other
modiﬁers when attempting to read or write anything.

Infamy (R1)
The character is about as well known as a character with Fame (R1),
but for diﬀerent reasons. The odds of being recognized are the same
as for Fame (R1), but the reaction is quite diﬀerent. The character
experiences hostility, prejudice, and intentional slights — in game
mechanic terms, the character should have the diﬃculty of all interactions increased by at least +3.
Restrictions/Notes: There is a reason for this negative attention.
Either the character did something, is accused of having done something,
or is suspected of having done something not particularly pleasant, or the
character has, through other strange circumstances, earned a “bad rep.”
Sometimes, this Infamy will help the character — but it shouldn’t help
too much. If the character had a combination of Fame and Infamy (by

Character Options
selecting both options), then maybe he’d earn a reputation like Wyatt
Earp or Jesse James in the American Old West — certain people would
look up to him or respect him, and there would be deﬁnite fear there
most of the time, but there would also be a lot of people who would
enjoy seeing the person leave or die. Of course, Infamy (R1) should
be something minor — maybe the character is a former criminal, or
he did something questionable in the past and was cleared. People are
not overtly hostile, but they are unfriendly when they recognize him.
Several ranks of Infamy can only be selected if the character is infamous
for multiple reasons — but the eﬀects should be cumulative, and this
can only be done if the gamemaster thinks it is appropriate (a character
with Infamy (R3) would hardly have to worry about Infamy (R1) in
most cases, so it would not be a proper combination).

Infamy (R2)
The character is, most likely, wanted for a crime of a fairly
serious nature, or he did something (or is
thought to have done something) in the
past that makes him hated and reviled
by most people. The rules are essentially
the same as for Infamy (R1) and the
recognition chances are similar to Fame
(R2), but the modiﬁer to interactions
should be, usually, at least +6.
Restrictions/Notes: As stated under
Infamy (R1), unless combined with Fame,
this Disadvantage only allows for the negative aspects of notoriety. A character who
has Infamy (R2) would be considered by
nearly everyone (but not everyone) to be
“scum” and someone who “deserves no
better than he gets.” When combined with
an equal or higher rank of Fame, there is
often that “fear and respect” option — many
characters will still try to betray or hurt the
character in some way, but most won’t be
that open about it.

Restrictions/Notes: See Infamy (R1) and Infamy (R2).

Language Problems (R2)
The character does not understand the language of the area she
spends most of her time in. She must learn skill pips in the specialization

Page 25

languages: (local language). She also receives a +6 diﬃculty modiﬁer in
addition to any other modiﬁers for what she’s attempting to convey
or understand.
Restrictions/Notes: The character cannot begin the game with
more than one pip in languages: (local language), but she may improve
the skill at the cost at +2 to the cost. However, the character should
speak another language in the game setting ﬂuently.

Learning Problems (R1)
When the character attempts to learn a new skill, or improve an old
one, he does so at +2 per rank to the Character Point cost. Alternatively,
the character can only learn or improve a skill if she attempts it and fails.
A character should have to fail with a single skill at least three times per
adventure before being allowed to learn or improve the skill.
This Disadvantage is associated with a single attribute, and it applies
to specializations. There should be
some sort of reason for this in the
character’s background, such as a lack
of education or diﬃculty reading.
Restrictions/Notes: This is the
counterpart to the Quick Study Special Ability, and it should be treated
in much the same way. This Disadvantage can be taken multiple times
and for a diﬀerent attribute.

Poverty (R1)
Since characters who adventure
tend to accumulate wealth, this Disadvantage is only available at Rank 1.
The character begins the game with
the shirt on his back and, maybe, a
few pieces of cheap and substandard
equipment. The character should
also have the attitude of someone
who is “poor,” whatever that might
be in the game setting.
If using Funds as an attribute,
this Disadvantage subtracts 10
from relevant totals.

Infamy (R3)
The character has trouble going out in
public because a lot of people hate her to
the point of violence. Chances are good that,
if she fails an interaction (with a +9 to the diﬃculty), the other person
will drive her away. The player could select Enemy (R1) in addition
to this Disadvantage to reﬂect those hunting her. However, the character could use disguises and avoid populated areas. Most likely, the
character has to move around until she can “live down” her infamy (if
ever) or until she dies.

•

Restrictions/Notes: As an
excellent combination, this Disadvantage could be selected with
Debt or Price to make the situation more realistic. Poverty can only
be selected once.

Prejudice (R1)
The character is of a minority group — or maybe it is just the character
himself — that is subject to prejudice and discrimination. The character
receives modiﬁers to the diﬃculties (from +2 to +4) during normal interaction with characters not of the minority group, and is generally treated
unfairly by society. The group the character belongs to, or the reason he
is discriminated against, should be identiﬁed immediately, and the player
should know how he can expect to be treated in most cases.

Chapter 2

•

Page 26

Restrictions/Notes: The gamemaster has to be careful with this
one. Roleplaying prejudice is not often something players want to get
into, and it can be especially uncomfortable in a real world or similar
setting. When used in a setting where there are many diﬀerent sapient
species, however, it can be quite interesting — especially if there are
several characters in the group who are prejudiced against.

Prejudice (R2)
The minority group the character belongs to is oppressed. The character experiences disparity virtually every day. While other characters
of the same minority group may not actually experience this prejudice
(that is, they didn’t select this option), it is probably because they aren’t
in positions where this discrimination can be easily practiced.
Restrictions/Notes: The character often experiences discrimination
and most interactions are performed at a +3 to +6 to the diﬃculty.
This prejudice should be roleplayed at every
opportunity. However, gamemasters
and players should only use this
Disadvantage when both sides are
comfortable with using it in a pretend
situation (see Bigotry and Prejudice for
more information).

Price (R1)
This is a Disadvantage similar
to Advantage Flaw. But, instead of
there being something wrong with
the character’s Advantage or a set of
three related skills, there is a “price tag”
attached. Every time the character wants
to use the ability, he has to pay a Price
at least a few times during the adventure
to continue using the ability.
The Price might be an actual fee
— and a signiﬁcant one at that. If the
fee isn’t paid, the Advantage goes away
until the price can be paid. But this won’t
work for many Advantages (at least not in
an interesting manner), so there are other
ways to do it.
Most likely, the Price will be a roleplaying eﬀect. Maybe every time a Contact
does a favor for a character, he not only demands the normal, negotiated recompense (if any), but the character must do a favor of equal
importance for the character. Or, whenever a piece of Equipment is
used, parts of it need replacing or servicing by a specialist (who may
charge a high fee or ask a favor), most likely after the adventure.
One more suggestion for Price (R1) would be that the character
has to pay one Fate Point or three Character Points at the end of an
adventure to “pay for” the use of the Advantage or skills. This reﬂects
the fact that the use of the Advantage takes something out of the
character when it is used.
Restrictions/Notes: The Price should be fairly easy to meet, but it
should take some work. At this rank, it should be something that the

character can roleplay along with an adventure or resolve between short
adventures or parts of longer adventures (like paying oﬀ the recipient
of the Price). However, if the character does not pay the Price, the
Advantage does go away — and, if in the gamemaster’s opinion the
character does this too often, both the Advantage and the Price should
go away permanently. Price can be taken often at various ranks, and
the same Price can be linked to more than one Advantage — though,
unless the Price is actually double (the character has to pay the same
price twice as often), it only counts as one Disadvantage.

Price (R2)
The Price for using a particular Advantage, or group of Advantages
or set of three related skills, is much higher than mentioned in Rank
1, but the rules are the same. Contacts will be extremely hard to pay
oﬀ or do favors for — maybe an entire short adventure has to be
devoted to paying back a contact who
helped out.
Optionally, paying two Fate Points
or six Character Points at the end of
an adventure where the Advantage
was used is a quick way of paying
the price.
Restrictions/Notes: See Price
(R1).

Quirk (R1)
The character suffers from a
personality quirk that makes certain
types of roleplaying and interaction
more diﬃcult. This quirk could
simply be a habit or an aﬀectation
that has gone too far, or it could
be a minor psychological problem.
Some examples include:
Dependency: The character has
a slight dependency on a substance
or even a roleplaying event. The
character might be a pack-a-day
smoker who, if he doesn’t get a
cigarette at least once every few
hours of game time, he gets irritable and loses Critical Success rerolls during interactions. Or maybe
the character always has to have the last word in any situation and will
often beat an argument into the ground rather than “lose.”
Kleptomania: When in a store or surrounded by small, portable
items, the character will occasionally try to “lift” something. When
possessed by his Quirk (see rules below), the character suﬀers +3 to
the diﬃculty of sleight of hand, lockpicking, or related attempts at theft
because he really doesn’t know he’s doing it.
Indecision: The character does not like making decisions and will
delay making them. When roleplaying, the player should actively
participate in group discussions, but he should be wishy-washy and
indecisive at critical moments.

Character Options
Stutter: When under pressure, relaxed, nervous (such as failing a
skill roll), or some other fairly common “mood” hits the character, he
stutters. The upshot is the character suﬀers +3 to the diﬃculty of any
interaction at this time and player should roleplay having a hard time
getting his ideas across to the other players. This lasts until the player
rolls a Critical Success.

Restrictions/Notes: Good roleplayers will have fun with these, and
other, Quirks that they come up with. Indeed, this Disadvantage is
often more fun to play than many Advantages — but the gamemaster
should make certain it is being roleplayed. Whenever the gamemaster
thinks it appropriate, he should make the player generate a willpower
or Presence total against a base Moderate diﬃculty to “indulge” in his
Quirk automatically (that is, “suﬀer” for it). The negative eﬀects of the
Quirk immediately come into play. Also, if the character repeatedly
makes this roll, resisting the impulses of the Quirk, the gamemaster
should start modifying the diﬃculty upwards until the character fails.
Multiple Quirks can be selected.
The gamemaster may allow multiple inclusions of the same version
of this Disadvantage, with all modiﬁers cumulative and an increase by
+5 per inclusion to the willpower diﬃculty.
Additional Note: Some players may choose to have their characters
roleplay Quirks they already have or might like to play. Sometimes this
works, sometimes it doesn’t. It can be hysterical to have a player “steal”
dice out from under another player’s nose (symbolizing the fact that
the character is taking necessary items away from the other player’s
character) as long as things don’t go too far (that is, when people start
getting upset). However, players who are “indecisive” should not play
characters who are indecisive — since they would be anyway. This is
too much like getting a Disadvantage for nothing.

Quirk (R2)
The rules for Quirk (R2) are the same as for Quirk (R1), only the
chance of occurrence is much greater and the eﬀects are larger.
Dependency: The character needs to fulﬁll his dependency much
more often (once a scene, perhaps). The character also experiences one
automatic Critical Failure per scene that he doesn’t (a smoker might
have a coughing ﬁt in the middle of a tense negotiation or during a
stealth attempt, for example).
Secret: There’s something about the character that she needs to
hide. If it were discovered, it would put her friends, family, and even
her own life at risk. This could be a civilian identity (if she has a heroic
alter ego) or a skeleton in the closet.
Restrictions/Notes: The diﬃculty of resisting the “impulse” is now
Diﬃcult, but all other rules are the same as under Quirk (R1).

Quirk (R3)
These “personality quirks” are much more serious. The character
might be a junkie, a psychotic with a certain type of behavior, or has a
severe phobia (he’s deathly afraid of something). Some examples:
Dependency: The character is a junkie, always after a “ﬁx.” The
“ﬁx” might be an illegal substance, or a perfectly normal one, or even a
type of roleplaying interaction (maybe the character has to try to come
as close to dying as he can).

•

Page 27

Paranoid: The character trusts no one. He receives a +6 to the bonus
number when trying to resist being conned, but he also receives this
“bonus” when trying to be persuaded — and he must be persuaded before
he’ll help even his closest friends. “Everyone is out to get him.”
Phobic: The character is deathly afraid of something. It could be
heights, open spaces, spiders, or another character. Unless the character
makes his willpower roll (below), he dissolves into terror.
Vengeful: The character cannot stand to “lose” or be “wronged.”
If the character perceives herself as looking foolish (or whatever), she
will go to great lengths to get even (in reality, the character probably
takes it too far).
Restrictions/Notes: The character has Very Diﬃcult Presence or
willpower roll to make to overcome the Quirk — at the least. If, in the
gamemaster’s judgment, there is a reason the character should have
modiﬁers to the diﬃculty, then he will. Players who don’t want to play
a character that can frequently lose control should avoid this option.
Other rules are the same as under Quirk (R1)

Reduced Attribute (R2)
Something about the character’s species, age, physical condition, or
some other factor has permanently reduced one attribute by one pip.
The character may not reduce the attribute die code below 1D, and
the attribute die code may never be increased by spending Character
Points (though gaining a Special Ability would help).
Restrictions/Notes: The reduction in die code increases by one
pip for each additional rank taken in this Disadvantage. (Remember
that three pips equal one die.) The character may have diﬀerent variations on this Disadvantage for each attribute, including Extranormal
attributes. Only one rank may be taken with an Extranormal attribute
of 0D, and the character’s species must be required to take at least 1D
in the aﬀected attribute. Characters who have this Disadvantage on
an Extranormal attribute before having any die code in that attribute
may never take that Extranormal attribute.

Advantages
Authority (R1)
The level of the Advantage is based on the character’s rank, duties,
and power in his local jurisdiction. An Authority (R1) Advantage
might belong to someone who, because of circumstance, does not
have a lot of opportunity to use his authority or someone who is very
low in rank.
Law Enforcement is one version of this Advantage that gives
adventurers some measure of abilities associated with being a deputized agent of the law. Authority: Law Enforcement (R1) means the
character can carry a ﬁrearm and has limited authority to enforce the
law. Private investigators, bounty hunters, and bail bondsmen would
need this Advantage.
Restrictions/Notes: It is not necessary to have the Authority: Law
Enforcement Advantage to own a ﬁrearm in those countries that allow
ordinary citizens to own them. However, if owning a gun is illegal in
a country and limited to deputized oﬃcials, then this version of the
Advantage would be necessary.

Chapter 2

Page 28

Remember, too, that outside of the character’s jurisdiction or permit
limits, this Advantage may have little or no value.

Authority (R2)
Same as Authority (R1), but the character has more inﬂuence, possibly commanding a small number of troops or being in charge of a
small company or town. With Authority: Law Enforcement (R2), the
character is actually a police oﬃcer and is allowed to make full arrests
and reasonable search and seizures.
Restrictions/Notes: See Authority (R1) for more information.

Authority (R3)
Same as Authority (R1), except that the character
has a great deal of power and inﬂuence. The head
of a large company or someone whose authority is simply never questioned would have this
Advantage. With Authority: Law Enforcement
(R3), the character is a federal agent and have
authority over local police for the purpose of
investigations.

Remember that contacts are gamemaster characters. They should
be created and played rationally. If a player refuses to roleplay or takes
advantage of contacts, he should be penalized when trying to use them
(and possibly lose them). There should also be a reason in the character’s
story why he has these contacts.

Contacts (R2)
This Advantage is identical to Contacts (R1), except the contact is
more powerful, more inﬂuential, easier to get hold of, willing to do
more favors, or aﬀects the game on a larger scale.
If the contact is supposed to be a large group, it now has much
greater inﬂuence over a wider area. In the real-world example, instead
of having the auto club as a contact, the character
might have a government agency
there to help him out
occasionally.
Restrictions/Notes:
Under no circumstances
should any contact, regardless of rank number, make
roleplaying and thinking
superﬂuous. Contacts are
totally under the control of
the gamemaster and, even
powerful and influential
contacts from this rank should
be kept under a tight rein.
See Contacts (R1) for more
information.

Restrictions/Notes: Higher levels of
Authority indicate a wider sphere of inﬂuence,
such as multiple countries or time. Otherwise,
see Authority (R1) for more information.

Contacts (R1)
The character “knows somebody” or a
group of somebodies who will generally
help out the character if he makes a decent
appeal or suﬃciently compensates the
contact. This level of contact only sticks
around for a limited amount of time (part
of an adventure or maybe throughout a
short adventure).
The character might know a “group”
with a wider range of inﬂuence (but
less power) that will help out, again, for a
modest fee or under the right circumstances. The inﬂuence
might not be as direct, but it is easier to come by. For example, there
might be clubs or organizations that will provide certain services for
travellers — maps, hotel reservations, emergency transportation, and
so on — for a small membership fee. You have to call them or go to
their oﬃces, and they won’t do much about that maniac with the gun
who is chasing you, but they can be of immense help under the right
circumstances.
Restrictions/Notes: Contacts should not automatically help the
character, but they should be reasonable in their negotiations. Multiple
contacts of various ranks may be selected and they may be stacked. For
example, a certain person might be a Contact (R1) in most circumstances, but he could be a Contact (R2) or even a Contact (R3) in the
right place — for example, a mercenary might help out for a fee versus
normal foes, but when ﬁghting his “hereditary enemies,” he might be
almost invincible and eager to help.

Contacts (R3)
The contact or contacts chosen
should be nearly supernormal,
supernatural, or uncanny in origin. For example, in a pulp ﬁction
setting, a character’s Contact (R3)
might be an “adventurer’s guild”
with globe-trotting members and
representatives who all have their own
unusual abilities — and who can turn

up at the oddest moments.
Work with the gamemaster to come up with some interesting contacts.
It might be a mystical force that “protects” the character under certain
circumstances, or a group of psionic monks who can be called upon for
“mental aid” — or maybe a really complete occult library.

Restrictions/Notes: Again, as with Contacts (R1) and (R2), don’t
let the contacts take over the game — and don’t let the player’s character
abuse them. Contacts are gamemaster controlled, but they will usually
only be brought into play at the character’s request.

Contacts (R4)
There is some sort of strange “force” that “watches over” and occasionally helps the character. In many ways, this Advantage is not as

useful in most adventure situations as the other versions of Contacts,
but it can have dramatic eﬀects on occasion.
Some examples of this include a particularly powerful gamemaster
character who will step in occasionally to help the character when he’s
in trouble. Or, a large governmental agency might, for some reason,
want to step in and aid the character at times.
Generally, the character can get minor assistance (as could be gotten from Contacts (R1) or Contacts (R2)) on a fairly regular basis
— and under the same sort of circumstances as having lower versions
of Contacts — but “the big stuﬀ” only happens when the gamemaster
thinks it appropriate. The character might get killed before the Contacts
(R4) intervenes — maybe the character just wasn’t doing something
the contact felt was important to it — but, most likely, assistance will
be provided.
Restrictions/Notes: Players’ characters should take this option
only if they want to take Disadvantages relating to it. For example,
if a character in a pulp ﬁction campaign wants to have a group of
super-scientists who like him and will supply him with substantial aid
on a regular basis (like a spy who gets outﬁtted with new gizmos at
the beginning of every adventure and who can call for more during
certain times in the adventure), then he should take Disadvantages that
relate to that. The character could be a member of an organization (see
the Disadvantage Employed), or he must do reciprocating favors for
the super-scientists (see the Disadvantage Price), or there are equally
powerful people who want to eliminate him because of his contacts
(see the Disadvantage Enemy).
If the character does not want to take extensive Disadvantages
relating to the contact, then Contacts (R4) should be unpredictable
and not always useful. For example, the super-scientists might provide

•

Page 29

the character with plenty of extraordinary equipment, but it might
not always be what the character needs or might not work correctly
all of the time.

Cultures (R1)
This is another Advantage that can be utilized in more than one
way. The ﬁrst way is the simplest. The character has knowledge of a
particular (usually unusual) culture that he can use to his beneﬁt when
among people of that culture. This acts both as a knowledge (scholar)
type skill and as a bonus (usually +1) to interaction in that culture.
Example: A character in a pulp ﬁction game setting might have Cultures (R1) pertaining to a certain Amazonian tribe. When the character
goes on an adventure in the Amazon, chances are good he will get help
from that tribe in his activities instead of being attacked as a stranger
or trespasser and ending up with his head on a pike.
The second way Cultures (R1) can be used is a little more widesweeping. The character has a knack for drawing parallels between
unknown/unusual and known cultures. For example, the character
might be able to ﬁgure out why certain religious taboos exist in a
society she’s just met. These should just be bursts of culture-related
intuition that the gamemaster supplies occasionally — the player can
only remind the gamemaster her character has this ability and hope
the gamemaster feels the situation is appropriate.
Restrictions/Notes: A character with Cultures (R1) has about the
level of knowledge of a frequent tourist — no more. Unless the character
has skills like streetwise, languages, and other supporting skills, he acts
as if he has visited the culture and learned a decent amount about their
ways, but he is deﬁnitely an outsider. This Advantage may be taken
more than once for diﬀerent cultures.
In the second example, the character has absolutely no control over
her ability and only gains very limited insights — though sometimes
at critical moments. The character cannot “call upon” this knowledge.
This version of the Advantage may not be taken more than once, but
it may be combined with the other type of Cultures at any rank.
In both cases, the character’s background must reﬂect the “special
insight” he has into the culture or cultural trends.

Cultures (R2)
This option can be used pretty much like Cultures (R1), only on a
larger scale. Instead of choosing a small, unusual culture, the character
might choose an “alien” culture (one totally diﬀerent from his own)
and gain an understanding of it comparable to the understanding in
Cultures (R1). Or, he could choose to learn more about a relatively small
cultural group (to the point where the character would be accepted as
one who has spent a lot of time with the people). The last option, the
sweeping cultural understanding, would also be much more in-depth.
The character would be able to call on cultural parallels much more
often and the gamemaster should give more information.
Restrictions/Notes: The same as for Cultures (R1), but the character
has about the level of knowledge of an outsider who has lived in the
culture for a while. Either that, or he would get more useful information on alien cultures or “sweeping” cultural examinations.

Chapter 2

•

Page 30

Cultures (R3)
The character is either a native of an unusual culture or has the
knowledge and the respect as if she were one. A person who has lived
a signiﬁcant portion of her life in a culture and has that sort of understanding of it would have Cultures (R3) — only the character is actually
a part of the game setting’s dominant culture as well.
If an alien culture can be, and is, selected, then the character has an
extreme familiarity with it. Alternatively, the character might be something of a cultural anthropologist — the character can observe a particular
culture for a brief time and have a very good (gamemaster-controlled)
chance of understanding the culture on a respectable level.
Restrictions/Notes: As with Cultures (R1) and (R2), the character
must choose what sort of cultural familiarity to have. Also, there must
be a compelling reason the character has this familiarity or understanding. Finally, if the character chooses to be a “native” of a particular
culture, she should probably have to learn language: (the culture’s major
language) at least +1D.

Cultures (R4)
This selection should be taken only if the game setting employs the
use of alien cultures (those not totally understood by the dominant
culture). The character understands the alien culture and can interact
within it — he is still an alien to it, but he is treated better than any
other outsider (most likely).
Example: In a game setting where “aliens live among us,” the character
is a Human member of secret society that keeps the aliens hidden. But,
because of something in his background history, he can interact with
certain types of aliens and he can understand their ways. This doesn’t
mean he’s friends with them, but he has a better chance of interacting
with them, ﬁguring them out, and outsmarting their “alien logic” than
other characters.

equipment totaling in cost not more than about US$1,000 (or a price
diﬃculty of Moderate) would ﬁt in this category.
Restrictions/Notes: Typically, as long as the character is not careless
with it, Equipment taken with any rank of this Advantage is replaceable,
unless the Burn-out Disadvantage is included with it. Equipment (R1)
may be selected more than once or in combination with higher ranks
of the Equipment Advantage with gamemaster approval.

Equipment (R2)
The character gains a piece of equipment that would be very hard to
get because of expense or availability. Standard military weapons that
are usually out of reach of the normal citizen are available. In addition,
equipment totaling in cost not more than several thousand U.S. dollars
(or a price diﬃculty of Diﬃcult) would probably be okay. In game
settings that have magical or super-science equipment, objects of fairly
low power would probably be obtained using this Advantage.
Restrictions/Notes: See Equipment (R1) for more information.
Equipment (R2) may be selected more than once or in combination
with higher ranks of the Equipment Advantage with gamemaster
approval.

Equipment (R3)
Items of equipment that are normally unavailable to just about
anyone can be picked up using this Advantage. Any one item on any
equipment chart can be selected, or the gamemaster can make up a
“special” item that has unusual eﬀects or Special Abilities. Or they can
just be really expensive or virtually unavailable items. Equipment totaling a few tens of thousands of dollars (or a price diﬃculty of Heroic)
falls under this category.

Restrictions/Notes: The gamemaster should watch this Advantage

dense penetration of recognition, but with less wide-sweeping eﬀects
(for instance, everyone in town knows who they are, but no one from
more than a few days travel away has ever heard of them).
Whenever the gamemaster or the player thinks the character might
be recognized (and the Fame Advantage would come into play), the
gamemaster should roll 3D. If the result is 15 or higher, the character
is recognized. Otherwise, he will have to do something “special” to
be recognized (and gain the beneﬁts of recognition).
If a character with Fame (R1) is recognized, he should gain small
perks, like being seated in a restaurant early, avoiding small legal
hassles (like routine customs checks), or just be treated generally
better (perhaps the character gets a couple of bonus points to persuasion, con, and charm attempts). Like most roleplayed Advantages,
the gamemaster should decide on the results.
Restrictions/Notes: Fame may be chosen multiple times as
long as the player deﬁnes how each Fame is diﬀerent. For example,
a character might have Fame (R1) in regards to his ﬁghting abilities, but another type of Fame pertaining to his intelligence or
some other ability.

Fame (R2)

The equipment could be a weapon more powerful than most personal
weapons in the game setting. Or it could be a magical spell that could
not normally be used by the character or anyone else in the world at
its relatively low diﬃculty. Or it could be a collection of gadgets and
gizmos that can perform many diﬀerent mundane tasks — but how,
nobody knows.
Restrictions/Notes: The character should have Disadvantages
related to the equipment. Maybe Enemies want to steal it, or it has
an Advantage Flaw so it doesn’t work all the time — or the same way
every time. In addition, the equipment should not make the character
so powerful that opponents fall before him. In game mechanic terms,
the equipment should be a just slightly more powerful or more useful
item than what is available normally. The more powerful the item, the
more Disadvantages and restrictions should be related to it.
Example: A character might choose an average gun and increase
the damage score by a modest two points, but make it so it never has
to be reloaded.

Fame (R1)
The character, for some reason, is fairly well known. The extent of
the character’s fame should be determined by the game setting. In a
global game setting (such as pulp ﬁction or real world), the character
has moderate recognition value in a particular region. In a smaller game
setting (like post-nuclear war settings), the character might have more

The character is very well known. On a global setting, the
character would probably be recognized in most fairly civilized
cultures and almost deﬁnitely in her home culture. The gamemaster should roll 3D and, on a 15 or higher, a person from
another culture will recognize the person and react (usually
favorably). In the character’s own culture, this reaction comes on
an 8 or more. If the character draws attention to herself in her own
culture (identiﬁes herself ), then the reaction will most likely be automatic (gamemaster’s option).
Restrictions/Notes: At this level of fame, the character should be
treated like a famous author, an occasional movie or television star, or
a reasonably recognizable sports ﬁgure (in a real world setting). Some
gamemaster characters will be immune to this fame, but most will have
some sort of (generally positive) reaction. Otherwise, see Fame (R1)
for more information.

Fame (R3)
There is a pretty good chance anyone in the game setting (unless
it is a multi-world setting) will recognize the character (or what the
character is) fairly easily. The base die total needed is 8, and it can be
modiﬁed by circumstance. The character has the status of a movie star,
a famous politician, or a top-ranked sports hero.
Restrictions/Notes: They are the same as for Fame (R1) and Fame
(R2) — certain people just won’t be impressed. In addition, characters
with Fame (R3) should almost always have to take the Disadvantage
Infamy at least Rank 1 — no matter how nice, talented, or generally
well-liked a person is, there’s always somebody out there who wishes
them harm.

Patron (R1)
The odds are that most players’ characters are not independently
wealthy. But they might have access to wealth in the form of patrons.

Chapter 2

•

Page 32

If the characters are treasure hunters, patrons might include museums, universities, private philanthropists, newspapers, or even retired
adventurers.
Patron (R1) means the character has a backer who will fund one
expedition, with all proceeds going to the patron. All of the costs
(room, board, travel, expenses) are covered by the patron, with the
understanding that the player’s character is basically just a worker-forhire. Anything that the adventurer discovers or purchases becomes the
property of the patron.

Patron (R2)
A Patron (R2) expects much less from those he backs. The character may receive less ﬁnancial support, but will have greater freedom
of action.
A newspaper publisher looking for hot stories is a common example
of an organization qualifying for Patron (R2). They cover a character’s
travel expenses and any legal fees in exchange for inspiring stories.
Anything that the character ﬁnds on his own (like artifacts) remain
his own.

Patron (R3)
A Patron (R3) will give a character a limited stipend and cover
most expenses, then oﬀer to purchase whatever the character recovers.
Without consistent results, the funding will be cut oﬀ.

Size (R1 or more)
The character is much larger or smaller than the average Human. For
every rank in this Advantage, the player receives +3 to his character’s
scale modiﬁer (which starts at zero). The player must specify whether
the character is bigger or littler than the average Human.
Restrictions/Notes: Generally, the character’s weight is proportional
for his height, but a Disadvantage, such as Hindrance: Reduced Toughness, or a Special Ability, such as Hardiness, could be used to represent
a very thin or very large character (respectively). Likewise, to reﬂect a
longer stride, the character should have the Hypermovement Special
Ability, while a shorter stride would get the Hindrance: Shorter Stride
Disadvantage.

Trademark Specialization (R1)
This Advantage works a lot like a combination of the Skill Bonus
Special Ability and Fame. The character is very good at one very speciﬁc
thing, and he is known for it. Choose any specialization that the character has (or would like to have in the future), and the character gains
+2D to the roll when it is used. In addition, when the character uses
it, there is a gamemaster-option chance that people will recognize how
“naturally good” the character is at the specialization, and this might
produce interesting situations. Also, the character might be contacted
by people or recognized by certain people because of how good he is
at that one specialization.
Restrictions/Notes: This character acts as if trained in the use
of this skill. No character may have more than two Trademark
Specializations.

Wealth (R1 or more)
The character with this Advantage probably has an estate or a series
of investments that will keep him comfortable for a good long time.
Alternatively, character could be minor nobility, have a large trust
fund, or be married to the owner of a large corporation. This doesn’t
mean the character can buy everything — he is still subject to the
availability of items.
For each rank in this Advantage, the characters has US$5,000 in
readily available cash once per month. The accounts never have more
than US$5,000 times the number of ranks each month (fees and living
expenses keep it to that level), the amount could be less by the end of
the month. Additionally, adventure bonuses could temporarily raise
the ﬁgure, though the character would have to purchase an additional
rank of Wealth to make the increase permanent. Players in games using
the Funds attribute gain +2 per rank to all such totals.
Restrictions/Notes: Characters should select only one rank of
Wealth, unless there is some reason they might have Wealth (R1) and
another rank of Wealth in other circumstances. Also, this wealth does
not always help and disappears if misused (and it should be a major
concern to the character at times), but it should be there most of the
time. Gamemasters will probably think of ways to work around wealth
and players should play along — if you can throw money at every
problem, then they aren’t that much fun to try to solve, are they?
The most likely Disadvantage a character with Wealth would have
is Devotion, such as “helping all those in need” or “righting all wrong

doing.” Otherwise, there should be fairly extensive reasons why the
character can’t use his wealth to resolve every situation — or hire
somebody to do it for him (which is really the same thing).

could be considered an animal, unless the gamemaster says otherwise
(for example, a horse would be animal, but a zombie with a Knowledge
of 1D would not).

Special Abilities

Armor-Defeating Attack (2)

Before allowing players to create characters with Special Abilities,
the gamemaster may wish to peruse this list to see if there are any she
would prefer not to appear in her games. She may also decide that
certain Special Abilities require speciﬁc Limitations on them or Disadvantages on the character.
Any Special Ability that gives a bonus to the die roll or the skill
total also allows the character to use that skill as if trained. Bonuses
received from taking multiple ranks of the same Special Ability are
added together.
Skills gained with a Special Ability are not improved when that Special
Ability is improved. Instead, they are increased as a normal skill.
Unless stated otherwise in the Special Ability, it does not count as an
action for the character to get the bonus from a Special Ability. However,
except for such automatic abilities as Natural Armor or Combat Sense,
the character must state that she is relying on the Special Ability or she
does not receive the bonus.

Accelerated Healing (3)
The character gains a +1D per rank to his Physique for all natural
healing attempts, and a Critical Failure is treated as 1, rather than
having a negative eﬀect on the die roll.

Ambidextrous (2)
The character is equally adept with her right or left hand. She may
perform an action with each hand in the same round, and, though she
takes the multi-action penalty, she receives a +1 per rank to each skill
total. The actions must involve the hands and each action must require
only one hand. If the character performs only one hand-related action
in a round, she does not get the bonus. Some skills that characters could
employ with either hand include brawling, lockpicking, marksmanship,
throwing, lifting, artist, forgery, and the map-making aspect of navigation,
though, of course, not every task covered by each skill is relevant. A
character may take multiple ranks of this Special Ability for two pairs
of hands and multiple ranks for each additional manipulative limb.

Animal Control (3)
This gives the character the ability to control one particular species
of animal, bird, or insect. The character gets a +10 bonus to her animal
handling total for that species. She must generate an animal handling
versus the Presence or willpower of the animal (more than one animal
can be targeted, although this is a multi-action). If the character gets a
high enough success (gamemaster’s decision), the animal is controlled
for a number of minutes equal to the animal handling skill total times
10. A controlled animal serves its master faithfully, even sacriﬁcing
itself on her behalf. The Special Ability has a range of sight or voice.
The character may gain one more species for each rank.
Note: A swarm of insects counts as one animal, as does a school
of small ﬁsh. Any creature with a Knowledge die code of less than 2D

When a character with natural weapons (the character’s ﬁsts, claws,
teeth, etc.) attacks someone protected by armor, this ability negates the
Armor Value, up to +1D per rank. The character must specify how the
attack negates the armor: an acidic mist slips through any openings,
enchanted claws reach directly to the ﬂesh, etc. There should be at least
one type of armor that is unaﬀected by this.

Atmospheric Tolerance (2)
The character can breathe one form of atmosphere (gas or liquid)
that would be lethal to most other characters. A character may not have
more than one rank in this ability, but he may have diﬀerent versions
for diﬀerent atmospheres.

Attack Resistance (2)
The character is highly resistant to a certain type of attack. She gains
+1D per rank to her damage resistance total against this type of attack.
Energy Attacks: Resistant to blasts of heat, ﬁre, electricity, radiation, light, cold, and so on, but not the ability to survive in extremes
of such environments.
Extranormal Attack: Resistant to damage from any Extranormalbased (such as Magic or Psionics) attack.
Mental Attacks: Resistant to mental harm from any source. It does
not provide protection against interaction attempts.
Nonenchanted Weapons: Resistant to physical damage from nonenchanted weapons, but not from poisons, energy, or similar materials.

Attribute Scramble (4)
The character can adjust an opponent’s (or a friend’s) attributes
temporarily. She gains the scramble skill at +1 per rank in a single version of this Special Ability (it is a Presence skill, described only here),
which she also can increase as a normal skill. The scrambler must pick
as her focus either physical or mental attributes (never Extranormal,
Funds, or Special Abilities). She can never do both, except by taking
this Special Ability once for each version.
When she goes after a target with an brawling roll, she may choose
(as a multi-action) to also perform a scramble attack versus her target’s
willpower or Presence. (This is not an action for the target.) No close
combat attack is necessary for a willing target, but the act of scrambling
still counts as an action. If her total is higher (not equal to), she may
shift her target’s attribute points around, within certain limits. The
close combat attack does no damage.
She may increase one or more related attributes by a number equal to
the amount she takes away from other related attributes — but she may
not decrease or increase any one attribute by more than 2D (6 pips).
The change lasts for a number of rounds equal to the diﬀerence
between the scramble attack and the target’s willpower or Presence. A
character who has been adjusted cannot be scrambled again until the
original adjustment wears oﬀ.

Blur (3)
The character can appear indistinct to the naked eye or nonenchanted
visual aids (binoculars, cameras, etc.). Commonly, a character with this
Special Ability will only be spotted out of the corner of the eye. This adds
1 to the character’s dodge, sneak, and hide totals, as well as +1 to all
default search, tracking, investigation, and attack
diﬃculties against the character that the blurring
character is not actively trying to defeat. (These
modiﬁers are per rank in this Special Ability.)
On the character’s turn, she may automatically
become blurry, without taking an action, and
remain so until she chooses otherwise. Blurring also makes it diﬃcult for the character
to hold a conversation with others.

on their depth. The character gains +1 per rank to contortion, dodge,
or sleight of hand totals, in addition to disguise attempts he performs
on himself.

Endurance (1)
The character has great endurance, and gains a +3D per rank to
Physique or stamina checks when performing taxing
physical tasks (such as holding
one’s breath underwater for a
long period or running a long
distance).

Enhanced Sense (3)
One of the character’s ﬁve
senses is heightened to abnormal
levels. The bonus to the skill total
received depends on the sense: sight
is +1; hearing is +2; touch, taste,
and smell are +3. The bonus is per
rank and applies to all skills related to
the sense. To have multiple enhanced
senses, this Special Ability must be
taken at least once for each sense.

Combat Sense (3)
The character can sense danger. She is
never surprised. Rather, she and her attacker
must determine initiative as normal. Even
if the attacker still goes before the character
does, any combat modiﬁer from the surprise is reduced by 2. A character may not
have this ability more than once.

Environmental
Resistance (1)

Confusion (4)
The character can hamper the
thoughts of those he comes into physical
contact with, at will. He gains the confuse skill at +1 per rank (it is a Presence
skill, described only here), which he
can increase as normal.
As a multi-action with a brawling attack,
he may also perform a confusion attack versus his target’s willpower
or Presence. (This is not an action for the target.) If his total is higher
(not equal to), the target is confused. Characters may not play cards (if
the gamemaster is using game-enhancing cards with the adventures) or
spend points, and they receive a +5 diﬃculty modiﬁer to even simple
actions for a number of rounds equal to two times the rank of this
Special Ability.

Darkness (3)
The character can project a ﬁeld of darkness around himself, adding
+5 per rank to the diﬃculty of any sight-based skill totals. The ﬁeld
extends in a half-sphere around the character with a radius equal to
one meter per rank. The ﬁeld can be maintained for a maximum of
one minute per rank before dispersing.

Elasticity (1)
The character can stretch, elongate, and compress his body, allowing
him to expand his height or become so narrow he can pass through
keyholes, cracks, or any other opening he could normally see through.
It takes one round or more to slip through small openings, depending

checks to resist ill eﬀects from these
environmental condition. The character
is not resistant to heat or cold attacks,
as these come and go too quickly for the
Special Ability to provide protection.

Extra Body Part (0)
The character has an extra limb or organ. If external, these may be
secondary arms or legs, a tail, or some more exotic bodily addition,
such as ﬁns, tentacles, or antennae. If internal, the parts are organs
such as extra eyes, hearts, or mysterious glands. Unless speciﬁed by a
Disadvantage or Limitation, the extra parts are included in the hero’s
body tastefully. Additionally, except in cases where the character has an
Enhancement or another Special Ability that uses this one this one (for
example, Extra Body Part: Tail and Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon:
Tail), the extra part is nonfunctional. A character may have only one
rank in this Special Ability, but she may have multiple versions to
represent multiple additional organs or limbs.

Fast Reactions (3)
The character gains +1D per rank to his Perception when determining initiative, and, for up to three times during the adventure, he may
receive one additional action for one round.

Character Options

Fear (2)
The character can provoke fear in those who can see or hear him.
He gains a +1 per rank to all intimidation totals and combat defense
diﬃculties against those so aﬀected. The willpower or Presence diﬃculty
to resist a Fear attack is 15.

Flight (6)
The character can ﬂy, either by nature or by virtue of having wings.
The character’s ﬂying rate equals his base Move times 2 times the number
of ranks. The ﬂying skill is required to maneuver.

Glider Wings (3)
The character can ﬂy by drifting with air currents, provided there is
suﬃcient wind (gamemaster’s call). Characters with this Special Ability
need the ﬂying skill to control their passage. A character may not have
this ability more than once.

Hardiness (1)
The character can take damage better than normal. She adds 1 per
rank to her damage resistance total against any type of damage.

Hypermovement (1)
The character is extremely fast, adding +2 meters per round per
rank to her base Move rate, which in turn aﬀects all other types of
movements.

Immortality (7)
The character is immortal, though she will grow older, at a decreased
pace compared to the rest of her species. If she is reduced to zero Body
Points, she doesn’t die. She will not go unconscious or bleed to death (as
mortally wounded characters do), but she will not heal without psionic
or magical aid or the Accelerated Healing Special Ability — her arms
could be blown oﬀ, her abdomen eviscerated, or whatever. She may
perform only the most minimal of physical actions, such as squirming,
and some actions may be impossible. She may rely on her Reﬂexes for
initiative purposes only.
There should be one particular set of circumstances whereby the
character will die forever. These sets of circumstances should not be
too unusual — killed directly by magic, drowned, decapitated, and so
on are all good examples.
A character may not have this ability more than once.

Immunity (1)
The character is highly resistant to disease and poisons and receives a
+1D per rank to Physique or stamina checks when determining whether
he has contracted an illness or suﬀering from ingested poisons.

Increased Attribute (2)
Some strange ability (or his species) allows the character to gain
+1 bonus per rank to all rolled totals related to that attribute. (For
Physique, this also includes the damage resistance total and Strength
Damage.) A character may have multiple ranks of this Special Ability,
as well as multiple versions of it.

•

Page 35

Note: To get another rank in this Special Ability after character
creation costs 4 times the number in front of the “D” of the attribute
that it aﬀects plus the number of ranks currently in the Special Ability.
(This is instead of the normal cost to increase Special Abilities.)

Infravision/Ultravision (1)
The character gains the ability to either see in the dark using infravision
or ultravision. Infravision allows the character to see changes in heat,
while ultravision enables the character to make the most of the available
light. Each provides a +2 per rank in a single version of this Special
Ability to sight-based rolls while in dim or dark conditions. Obviously,
extreme heat or light prevent this Special Ability from working.

Intangibility (5)
The character can reduce his physical density to virtually zero for one
minute per rank. During that time, his damage resistance score against
physical and energy attacks is +3D per rank, but his movement rate is
halved. An intangible character can pass through solid objects, providing
they do not contain wards or other spells of protection designed to repel
passage of this nature. He may not pass through energy or electriﬁed
barriers. While intangible, the character cannot carry any object along
(including clothing), nor can he attempt any physical attack. It takes a
full round for a character to become intangible or solid, during which
he can do nothing else. The character must spend at least one minute
solid before attempting intangibility again.

Invisibility (2)
The character can become transparent. This adds 1 per rank to the
character’s dodge, sneak, and hide totals, as well as +1 per rank to all
default search, tracking, investigation, and attack diﬃculties against the
character that the invisible character is not actively trying to defeat.
Additionally, no character may take an action to “spot” the character
unless the gamemaster feels there is suﬃcient provocation, such as
brushing against others or removing something in a crowded area.
The invisibility covers the character’s basic clothes only — not any
gear she’s carrying, or anything she picks up. Also, remember that the
character is transparent when invisible — she can’t hide things behind
her back.

Iron Will (2)
The character is highly resistant to all interaction attempts and mental
attacks. The character gains a +1D per rank to all willpower rolls and +2
to the default diﬃculty of any such attempts against this character.

Life Drain (5)
This ability allows the character to drain attribute pips or Body
Points from his target.
The character must choose one set of attributes to target, either physical
(Reﬂexes, Coordination, Physique), mental (Knowledge, Perception, Presence),
Wounds, or Body Points. For example, most vampires drink blood, and
thus lower Body Points, while succubi target the soul and so weaken
mental attributes. The player must specify in what manner the character
drains these attributes (biting a vein, hypnosis, and so) It should involve
some sort of successful attack result (either physical or mental).

When the character wishes to employ Life Drain, he makes an
attack on his target using the relevant skill. For every four points over
the target’s defense roll, the character drains one pip per rank oﬀ each
of the target’s relevant attributes or three points per rank from the
character’s Body Points or one Wound for every two ranks. (Remember
that there are three pips in each die.)
If any of the target’s attributes or Body Points ever go to zero (or the
character reaches the Dead Wound level), the target dies. If the target
survives, she regains one attribute point (to each attribute aﬀected) every
hour after the attack. Body Points return at the normal rate.
For each attribute pip the character drains, he may add one pip to any
attribute in his chosen category. He would get one Body Point for each
Body Point drained or one Wound for each Wound drained.
Life Drained attributes and unused Body Points or Wounds disappear at a rate of one pip or point per hour.
A character may have multiple ranks of this Special Ability, as well
as multiple versions of it.

Longevity (3)
The character lives longer than the average Human. Often, this
Special Ability has a Flaw attached that governs what the character must
do to maintain his life. The character should gain peripheral bonuses
during game play because of his “longer outlook.” A character may not
have this ability more than once.

Luck, Good (2)
The character is blessed with unusually good luck. Once per adventure, a character with Good Luck can receive one of the following beneﬁts
just by asking for it: action, breakthrough, haste, or second chance. See
the “Luck Beneﬁts” sidebar for details on each of these options. Calling
upon one’s luck does not count as an action.

Good Luck can only be declared once per rank during a particular
adventure, but it may be declared at any time, and it cannot be cancelled by any other eﬀect. A character may have up to two ranks of this
Special Ability. This Special Ability can be taken with the Bad Luck
Disadvantage — sometimes really good things happen, sometimes
really bad things happen.

Luck, Great (3)
A character with Great Luck can call on one of the following beneﬁts once per adventure per rank: action, alertness, breakthrough, haste,
hero, opponent fails, or second chance. See the “Luck Beneﬁts” sidebar
for details on each of these options. Calling upon one’s luck does not
count as an action.
If the character has not used his Great Luck during an adventure
and something really disastrous happens, the gamemaster may choose
to counteract the eﬀects and temporarily “burn out” the character’s
Special Ability — that is, the character’s Great Luck has been used up
for the adventure. Usually, this is used when the character does something stupid or the player is the victim of incredibly bad luck — die
rolling, not the Disadvantage — and something “stops” the eﬀect. This
is a “last ditch,” gamemaster-controlled eﬀort when circumstances get
out of control. It is also a nice thing for inexperienced roleplayers to
have — just in case they do something they really shouldn’t have, they
get another chance.
Example: The character’s mission is to turn oﬀ the power at a
nuclear plant or it will explode and destroy the city that’s conveniently
downwind. Unfortunately, the character takes too long ﬁghting the
minions of the bad guy who set the plant to overload, and, according
to the rules, the whole city should go up in a radioactive ﬁreball. The
character is too late. The gamemaster might choose to have the character
be really lucky — the villain was bluﬃng, and there’s really more time

Character Options
on the clock than anyone thought, or the power plant begins a long
meltdown procedure instead of exploding. In any case, the character’s
Good Luck is gone for this adventure (his luck ran out), but he has a
chance of averting disaster.
As with Good Luck, the character may have up to two ranks of this
Special Ability. Also, this Special Ability can be taken with the Bad
Luck Disadvantage — sometimes really good things happen, sometimes
really bad things happen.

Master of Disguise (3)
The character has a natural talent for disguise. She gains a +5 per
rank bonus to all disguise totals and a +1D bonus per rank to any Presence-based actions while in that disguise.

Multiple Abilities (1)
A character might have multiple minor abilities that are increased by
a Special Ability. All bonuses are added to the skill or attribute total, not
to the die code. For example, a character could have “eyestalks” that give
him a +1 bonus to Perception or search totals that would negate surprise,
the ability to focus his ears on particular types of noises (+1 bonus when
listening for particular sounds), and ﬁngers that are sensitive to subdermal
motion (+1 bonus to lockpicking against safes with moving tumblers). All
the bonuses should be fairly limited in their applications, pertaining to
only speciﬁc uses of particular skills (like specializations do), but there can
be several of them for each selection of this Special Ability. The maximum
total bonus for each rank of this Special Ability is +4.

Natural Armor (3)
The character has plates, toughened skin, scales, or something
similar. His own surface adds 1D per rank to his damage resistance
total to physical (not energy or mental) attacks and contact poisons,
corrosives, or similar materials.

Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon (2)
The character has some sort of natural weapon — such as claws,
pincers, bone sword, or stinger — that adds 1D per rank to his Strength
Damage when determining his damage with the natural weapon. The
character uses brawling to attack, unless the weapon is something
that detaches from him or (in the case of a super-scientiﬁc or magical
weapon) exists separately. In this latter case, the character employs
melee combat to wield it.

Natural Magick (1)
The character can use a magic spell as a natural ability. An example
of this would be a character who can dispel magic by his nature, rather
than through the use of a countermagic spell. The cost of the ability
— and the number of ranks the character has in it — equals the difﬁculty of the spell. (See the “Magic” chapter for details on creating
spells; the “Precalculated Spells” chapter has some sample spells.) The
chosen spell may not be charged (that is, have a ﬁxed limit to the
number of times it can be cast).
The character must adhere to the requirements of the spell, including its gestures, incantations, components, and so on. The casting of

•

Page 37

the spell is automatic (there is no need to roll a Magic skill to perform
it), but the character does need to attempt any targeting skill or skill
required by the casting (such as one needed to perform a gesture). If
any of these fail, the spell does not work.
The player and the gamemaster need to discuss what spell the
character will have, and what the range, duration, and so on will be.
It’s suggested that some limitations be placed on the use of this ability
to maintain game balance — for instance, a character who can toss
ﬁreballs as a natural ability might have to recharge for a certain number
of rounds between doing so.
A character may have this Special Ability once each for diﬀerent
spells.

Natural Ranged Weapon (3)
The character has some sort of natural ranged weapon, using missile weapons (for solid objects) or marksmanship (for energy, gas, or
chemical projection or for solid projectiles in cybernetics or super-science weapons) to target it. Long range equals 20 times the number of
ranks in this Special Ability times the character’s Physique, lifting, or
marksmanship (as appropriate) in meters. The damage for physically
enhanced projections is the character’s Strength Damage plus 1D per
rank, while the damage for all other types of blasts is 3D per rank. The
projection must have a visible eﬀect (such as a ray that glows or bone
spikes) and it may not do mental damage. Note that, regardless of the
nature of the projection, there are no additional eﬀects from this type
of Special Ability unless an Enhancement allows otherwise.

Omnivorous (2)
The character can gain nourishment from any organic substance
(though she is not immune to poisons). She can also chew through
just about any organic substance with no adverse eﬀects to her teeth or
jaws. A character may not have this ability more than once.

Paralyzing Touch (4)
The character can freeze her target with the merest touch.
When she makes a brawling attack, she may, instead of doing
damage, paralyze her victim, who remains that way until he makes a
successful Presence or willpower roll against the brawling skill total. He
may attempt to do so once per round; the only other actions he may
take are mental-based ones and Extranormal or Special Ability ones that
do not require movement. Note: Characters who are heavily armored
or covered will be harder to hit. The gamemaster needs to decide how
much skin is exposed and adjust the attack diﬃculty accordingly.
A character may not have this ability more than once.

Possession, Limited (8)
The character can possess the body of a living creature or a corpse.
The character must be within three times the rank of this Special Ability
in meters of the target in order to possess it.
Possessing a corpse doesn’t require a roll, but it does take an action.
Possessing a living being involves making a Presence or willpower check
by the possessor versus a standard interaction diﬃculty. Exceeding (but
not equalling) the diﬃculty means the target has been possessed. The
target can actively defend if she is aware of the potential danger.

Chapter 2

Page 38

To gather knowledge about his host body’s life, the possessing character must generate a successful investigation total against the target’s
Knowledge roll (this does not count as an action for the target). Information the possessor gains depends upon the level of success achieved;
see the accompanying chart for details.
With Limited Possession, the character does not gain control of
the new form. Instead, he must use persuasion, intimidation, or other
interaction skills to convince his host to do what he wishes.
Exiting a host body is commonly a simple action. As long as the
possessing character exits before the host dies, he simply moves on to
his own or another form. Killing a possessing spirit usually involves
taking it completely by surprise with a killing blow to the host form or
using a spell to force it to remain in the body until it can be slain.

skill changes to reﬂect the adjustments in the base attribute. Likewise,
not all skills will be usable in the new form.
Attribute dice can also be used to include Special Abilities in the new
form. One attribute die can be spent to gain one rank in one Special
Ability or to get a +2 skill total bonus (split among up to two skills).
The gamemaster may allow a larger skill total bonus or more skills to
fall under the bonus if the desired eﬀect is particularly narrow (such
as a bonus for a single sense).
For an example of how Shapeshifting can work, see the accompanying sidebar.
Shapeshifting may be done at will, though a Limitation may force
it to be triggered by stress or environmental factors.
If shifting voluntarily, the character must generate a disguise total
of 11 to bring about the change, and a second total to turn back
again. Each change takes one

Sense of Direction (2)

Silence (3)

The character has a good sense of direction. He gains +1D per rank
to navigation and tracking rolls.

The character can move in complete silence. He gains +2D per rank
to all sneak checks and a +1D per rank when attacking from behind.

Shapeshifting (3)

Skill Bonus (1)

The character can manipulate the shape, color, and overall appearance
of her body, though mass and body compositions remain the same.
The character must chose a speciﬁc creature to emulate, gaining one
form for every three additional points spent on this Special Ability. At
six ranks in this ability, the gamemaster may allow shifting among one
class of creatures (such as birds or furniture) as long as all forms chosen
for previous ranks were within the same class.
Body Points, Wounds, and the Knowledge attribute remain unaffected by this Special Ability, but the dice in the Reﬂexes, Coordination, Physique, Perception, and Presence (although the die code in the
willpower skill remains the same regardless of the change in form) are
redistributed to match the new form. Additional dice in skills above
the base attribute score remain the same, though the total dice in each

Skill Bonus represents a natural talent (a character with the Charismatic group might be “friendly and outgoing”), a particular knack (a
character with the Animal Friendship group has a “way with animals”),
years of devotion to a profession prior to beginning adventure, or the
result of an extended life.
The character chooses a group of three related skills in which he
gains +1 to the skill total of any action performed with those skills (or
specializations of that skill). The skills need not be under the same
attribute. The character may or may not actually have adds in those
skills, and the gamemaster must approve the fact that they are “related.”
Some examples of skill groups include:
Acting: charm, con, disguise
Acute Balance: acrobatics, climbing, sneak

Players may substitute other related skills for the ones listed in the
groups above, or create their own groups as long as there is a common
thread and the gamemaster approves the grouping.
Three specializations may replace one general skill, getting a +1 for
three diﬀerent specializations.
Example: In the Investigative group, a character might take out
investigation and replace it with three specializations — investigation:
eavesdropping, investigation: evidence analysis, and investigation: reconnaissance. While this means the character gains no bonus for “general”
investigation activities (such as a roll to research a project), he does have
a more “detailed” group. This may be done for all three skills in the
group, that is, choose nine specializations instead of three skills.
Additionally, the character acts as if trained in these skills even if
he doesn’t have any additional pips in them, and so does not get the
unskilled modiﬁer. This Special Ability does not aﬀect the cost of
improving the related skills.

•

Page 39

Gamemasters may allow a higher bonus for fewer skills (such as
a set of two skills where one gets a +1 bonus and the other gets a +2
bonus, or a +3 bonus to a set of three specializations). However, the
bonus per rank may total no more than +3.
At each additional rank, the player may increase the bonus by +1 for
three of the skills aﬀected by this Special Ability. A character may have
diﬀerent versions of this ability for diﬀerent groups of skills, though
the skills in each group may not overlap.

Skill Minimum (4)
The character can select three related skills unaﬀected by any other
sort of Special Ability and the character will always gain a minimum
total of 3 times the number before the “D.”
Example: If the player selects persuasion, charm, and intimidation
(all interaction skills) for his character, all of which he has at 4D, and
he generates a less than 12, the total automatically becomes 12. That
is the character’s minimum total.
The player may not select Skill Minimum for any skill that has any
other Advantage or Special Ability tied to it. Also, the skills must be
related in some way (see the Skill Bonus Special Ability for information
on related skills). The character may only select general skills, but the
specializations underneath that general skill are aﬀected as well. This
Special Ability may be selected only once for each group of skills.

Uncanny Aptitude (3)
This Special Ability is similar to the Skill Bonus Special Ability in
that some sort of bizarre ability gives the character added bonuses to
certain actions. However, instead of selecting a group of skills that
the character gains a bonus to, the player and the gamemaster work
out circumstances where these abilities come into play. For instance,
a character might gain a +1 bonus to all Reﬂexes-related skills totals
when in sunlight.
A character may have several variations of this ability, reﬂecting
diﬀerent bonuses. Each variation could have several ranks, with the
bonuses adding to each other.

Teleportation (3)
The character can move instantly to another place up to 10 meters
per rank away. The character must see her destination clearly. In combat, this action takes an entire round. The character may take along
whatever she can carry.

Transmutation (5)
The character can alter his substance to something else, while retaining his form (such as a man who turns to stone). Characters with this
ability may only shift into one speciﬁc substance, which the player
must specify when his character gets the Special Ability. Generally, this
substance gives the character distinct advantages. The player may select
up to four points (not ranks) in other Special Abilities that relate to the
chosen form, per rank in this Special Ability. (Thus, two Transmutation
ranks means eight points in other Special Abilities.) Natural Armor,
Hardiness, and Environmental Resistance are common ones.

Ventriloquism (3)
The character can throw her voice up to three meters away per rank.
No skill roll is required to do this, but if it is part of a trick attempt,
she receives a +2D bonus per rank to con and charm rolls.

Water Breathing (2)
The character can breathe water and will not drown in water. She
gains +1D per rank to all swimming rolls because she doesn’t need to
worry about drowning.

Youthful Appearance (1)
The character looks much younger than she actually is and receives
a +1D per rank to charm, con, or disguise attempts that involve posing
as someone youthful. In general, characters should not look more than
10 to 20 years younger than they are, regardless of the number of ranks,
though gamemaster discretion and common sense should rule here.

Special Ability Enhancements
Enhancements allow Special Abilities to be somehow more than
the typical version. Each Enhancement may be taken more than once
for each Special Ability, either altering the ability in similar though
distinct ways or, for some, through stacking the eﬀects. The cost of the
Enhancement adds to the associated Special Ability’s total cost (base
cost plus the cost for additional ranks).
Additional Eﬀect (1): The Special Ability produces a useful, though
minor, side eﬀect that is a natural extension of the power. The more
useful the side eﬀect, the greater the number of ranks. Some examples
include a skill bonus when using the ability, doing residual damage
(such as reﬂection with Natural Armor or radiation with Natural Ranged
Weapon), or adding functionality to an Extra Body Part.
Bestow (see description): The character may share her Special
Ability with a certain type of target: sentient living, nonsentient living,
or nonliving. The player must chose which group when including this
Enhancement. The cost of this Enhancement equals one-half (rounded
up) of the Special Ability total (base cost plus additional ranks cost plus
Enhancement costs). She may only use her Special Ability on herself
and on members of her target group with a multi-action penalty. Some
Special Abilities will require better stories concerning how the character
can manage sharing them than others (such as Youthful Appearance or
Ambidextrous), while others may not have this Enhancement (such as
Longevity or Immortality). The target has control over the use of the
Bestowed Special Ability for as long as the Bestowing character allows.
A character may only have one rank in this Enhancement, but she may
have multiple versions of it.
Extended Range (3): The factor used to determine the range of the
character’s Special Ability is increased. Every rank of this Enhancement
allows the player to add one half of the ranks in the Special Ability
(rounded up) to the factor when determining the range. Thus, to increase
the range factor by half the ranks costs three, by the ranks in the ability
costs six, by 1.5 times the ranks costs eight, and so on.
Example: The range for Natural Ranged Weapon is 20 times the
number of ranks in the Special Ability times the character’s Physique or

lifting in meters. With two ranks of Extended range, the range would
now be 20 times twice the number of ranks in the Special Ability times
the character’s Physique or lifting.
Magically Empowered (4 for 1 rank; 5 for 2 ranks): The Special
Ability comes from a magical source — a feature of the character’s
species, a result of the character’s parentage, a means of explaining
a mysterious ancient artifact, and so on. A Special Ability provided
by a spell does not need this Enhancement, nor does Natural Magic
require it. An item created for a character because of the Equipment
Advantage would.
Two ranks exist for this Enhancement. At Rank 1, with a cost of
four, the power with this Enhancement has a magical power source, but
it is not truly magical in nature. If it does damage, protecting Special
Abilities or magical spells of any defensive nature can defend against
it as normal. It can act on characters in astral form, spirits, and other
magical creatures or magical items not aﬀected by normal harm. It does
harm to those beings and items at one-half of its damage total, before
modiﬁers and rounded down.
If it provides protection, it defends at one-half its total, before
modiﬁers and rounded down, against magical blasts or Special Abilities
possessed by demons, ghosts, and other magical or spiritual beings.
In both cases, these bonuses are in addition to the normal applications of the Special Ability.
At Rank 2, with a cost of ﬁve, the power with this Enhancement is
magical in nature. If it does damage, protecting Special Abilities only
defend at one-half their die code (rounded down) against its attacks,
but the Enhanced Special Ability can be completely protected against
by other magical Special Abilities (protecting Special Abilities with this
Enhancement; spells that protect against magical attacks; and protective
versions of Natural Magick). It can be used against characters in astral
form, spirits, and other magical or spiritual creatures or magical items
not aﬀected by normal harm. For both cases, this is in addition to the
regular manifestations of the Special Ability.
If the Special Ability with this level of Enhancement provides protection to the character, it can defend against normal and magical powers
(attacking Special Abilities with this Enhancement; damage-dealing
spells; and attack versions of Natural Magick; Special Abilities magical
in nature possessed by demons, ghosts, and the like).
To include this Enhancement with a Special Ability in an item, the
item’s Special Ability should also have the Limitation Burn-out (R1),
item can be lost or stolen.
Multiple Targets (2): The character may use the Special Ability
more than once per round without incurring a multi-action penalty.
For each rank in this Enhancement, the character gains one additional
use of the Special Ability. This adds to any other bonus actions provided
by a power; it does not multiply it.

Special Ability Limitations
These Limitations can be associated with Special Abilities, restricting
their functionality and reducing their total cost (base cost plus the cost
for additional ranks plus any Enhancements — not the per rank cost).
For example, the total cost of two ranks of Iron Will in a game where
Special Abilities are uncommon is four, and in a game where they are
common, the cost is three.

Character Options
Limitations may not lower a Special Ability’s total cost below one,
and all Limitations must have some sort of eﬀect on play — just like
Disadvantages. Each of a character’s Special Abilities may have more
than one of each Limitation, as they can either describe similar but
distinct negative situations or, in some cases, stack the eﬀects.
Ability Loss (3 for 1 rank; 4 for 2 ranks): The character temporarily loses his Special Ability at regular intervals or, when the Special
Ability is used, he loses the ability to use a common skill in which he
has experience (that is, additional pips or dice). Examples include: a
character who cannot shapeshift when the sun is out; a character who
cannot use his natural weapons on a particular day of the month or
during a certain phase of the moon. The character is aware of what the
circumstances are that will cause this. For an additional point and additional rank, the character must undergo
some sort of (fairly simple) procedure to
regain his ability or skill use. A Special
Ability may only have a maximum of
two ranks in a single variation of this
Limitation, but a character may have
it multiple times for diﬀerent Special
Abilities, circumstances, or combinations of Special Abilities and skills.
Allergy (3 for 1 rank; 4 for 2
ranks): The character has a fairly
minor allergy. Exposure to a fairly
common substance (smoke, sunlight,
particular food, etc.) causes the character to lose all Critical Success rerolls
until the condition is removed. For
an additional point and additional
rank, the eﬀects are worse, and the
character loses all actions due to
coughing ﬁts, watering eyes, or
similar discomfort until she can get
away from the allergen. A Special
Ability may only have one rank in
this Limitation, though it may have
several diﬀerent Allergies.
Cybernetics (0): An artiﬁcial
limb or organ provides the character’s Special Ability. As a cybernetic
improvement is impossible to accidently drop or remove, this Limitation has no cost. Characters may have only one rank in it.
Burn-out (1): See the Disadvantage by this name for suggestions
that could also be applied to a Special Ability. The more likely the
burn-out, the greater the number of ranks in this Limitation. A Special
Ability may have multiple variations of this Limitation, representing
diﬀerent triggers for the Burn-out.
Debt (3): Someone (or, more likely, some entity) gave the character
the Special Ability. See the Debt (R3) Disadvantage for suggestions. A
Special Ability may only have one rank in this Limitation.
Flaw (1): All diﬃculties associated with using the Special Ability
are increased by +2 per rank. The greater the rank associated with this
Flaw, the greater the diﬃculty modiﬁer.

•

Page 41

Minor Stigma (3): The character cannot use the Special Ability
without performing the “proper rituals” before or after (someone with
a natural weapon who must sketch an image of his intended victim
before hunting him down; a shapeshifter who must be puriﬁed by his
cult after killing someone). A Special Ability may only have one rank
in this Limitation.
Others Only (2 for 1 rank; 3 for 2 ranks; 4 for 3 ranks): The
character may not use the Special Ability himself; he may only allow
others to use it. The value of this Limitation depends on how many
groups of “others” he can use it on: For two points and one rank, the
character may aﬀect sentient living, nonsentient living, or nonliving
targets. For three points and two ranks, the character can aﬀect only
two of the three groups. For four points and three ranks, the character
can aﬀect only one of the three groups. This Limitation may not be
taken more than once per Special
Ability. Additionally, like the Bestow
Enhancement, some Special Abilities
may require valid reasons before the
gamemaster will allow the Limitation’s
inclusion. Some abilities, such as
Immortality and Longevity, may not
have this Limitation. The target who
gets the Special Ability has control over
its use as if she actually had the ability, for
as long as the giving character allows.
Price (1): The character must fulﬁll
certain obligations in order to use the
Special Ability. Perhaps when using
Water Breathing, the character must
remain in the water for at least 24 hours
for every 24 hours out of it or suﬀer -4
modiﬁer per rank in this Limitation to
his damage resistance total for changing
environments so quickly. Alternatively,
there could be a Character or Fate Point fee
of three Character Points per rank or one
Fate Point per rank in the Limitation.
Restricted (1): The Special Ability is
hindered in a way not covered by any other
Limitation. The more restrictive the situation, the greater the number of ranks in this Limitation. For instance, a
Natural Weapon (either kind) may only be useful against certain items.
A Special Ability may have multiple variations of this Limitation, each
representing a diﬀerent restraint.
Side Eﬀect (2): One of the character’s Special Abilities has some
sort of annoying side eﬀect that appears with its use, such as constant
whistling, a continuous glow, or a terrible stench. Add 4 per rank to
the diﬃculty of all stealth attempts when the Special Ability is in use,
as everyone can ﬁgure out she’s coming. This will also aﬀect interaction
attempts, adding at least a +1 per rank to the diﬃculty.
Singularity (1 per Special Ability): The character may use only
one of a group of two or more Special Abilities each round. It does not
take an action to switch Special Abilities. He may change the Special

Chapter 2

•

Page 42

Ability in use at the beginning of his turn in a round, and he may
rely on the chosen Special Ability until the next time he changes it.
For a second rank (and an additional one point per Special Ability),
it does take an action to switch Special Abilities. A Special Ability
may not have more than two ranks in this Limitation and all Special
Abilities in the same group must have this
Limitation at the same rank. Not all of a
character’s Special Abilities need be in the
same Singularity group.
Super-science (2): The Special Ability is
contained in a piece of equipment — such as
a gun, a staﬀ, or a ring — developed through
a technological means not readily available
and certainly experimental. The item could be
lent to another character or taken away with

a successful grab and used by someone else, though at a +5 to the difﬁculty. On a Critical Failure, the item malfunctions and requires repair.
Unless combined with the Burn-out Limitation, a destroyed item may
be recreated in a number of days equal to the total cost of the Special
Ability (including all ranks, Enhancements, and Limitations). Characters
who wish to have Special Abilities in
their cybernetic implants may not
take this Limitation, as cybernetic
implants are impossible to remove
without serious and extended eﬀort.
(See the Cybernetic Limitation,
described herein.)

CHAPTER THREE

Improving Characters
What’s in this Chapter
Once players have taken their characters through an adventure or
three, they’ll want to improve or change them. This chapter provides
guidelines for accomplishing that.

Learning and Improving Skills
When a player ﬁrst creates a character, she should use the character
creation guidelines for gaining attributes and skills.
Players whose characters have been through at least one adventure
can use Character Points, accumulated from completing adventures,
to learn new skills and improve old ones. Spending Character Points
this way may be done only between adventures.
In addition to Character Points, the character needs experience
with the skill, either through training or by attempting to use the skill
(through rolling its die code or its governing attribute’s die code, regardless
of the outcome) during an adventure. If the gamemaster decides that
there is a signiﬁcant amount of training involved (such as improving a
skill beyond 6D), or the character needs to ﬁnd a suitable teacher, that
might become an adventure’s focus. (The teacher must have a skill die
code higher than the one the potential student currently has.)
The cost of getting one pip in a new base skill equals the number
before the “D” in the governing attribute’s die code.
Example: If a character wants to learn languages after an adventure
and he has a Knowledge die code of 3D, the ﬁrst pip in languages
costs him three Character Points. The hero then has a 3D+1 in his
languages skill.
The cost of improving an existing skill is determined in the same way,
except that the number of dice in the skill (instead of in the attribute)
is used to determine the cost.
Example: A character has a dodge of 4D+2 and wants to increase
it. To raise the skill by one pip to 5D, the character must spend four
Character Points. To increase the skill to 5D+1 after the next scenario,
the character must spend ﬁve Character Points.
The cost to get one pip in a new specialization equals one-half of
the number before the “D” in the governing attribute or skill’s die
code. The cost to improve an existing specialization by one pip equals
one-half of the number before the “D” in specialization skill’s die code.
(In both cases, round up.)
A character does not need the governing skill to get a specialization
in it. However, if he does have one, getting a specialization in it acts as
a bonus to the base skill when taking actions of that type, but it does
not also improve all uses of the base skill.

Example: For a character with 6D in missile weapons to gain a bow
and arrow specialization, he needs to spend three Character Points to
get a +1 in the specialization. The full missile weapons skill, however,
stays at 6D.
Specialization improves when the base skill improves.
A character may improve a skill or any of its specializations but not
both. In other words, a character may improve as many specializations
as he desires at the same time, though he cannot improve them at the
same time as he’s improving the governing skill. Skills and specializations
may only be improved by one pip each in between each adventure.
Once characters reach 10D in a skill, gamemasters may choose to
use the upper limit rule for improving attributes (see that section for
details).
Extranormal skills cost twice as much to learn as other skills. Skills
gained due to a Special Ability are not improved when that Special
Ability is improved. Instead, they are increased as a normal skill.

Improving Strength Damage
As a character’s Physique or lifting goes up or is altered by Special
Abilities, Disadvantages, or Character Point expenditure, reﬁgure the
Strength Damage die code: take the character’s new Physique or lifting (including any modiﬁers from Disadvantages or Special Abilities)
and drop the pips. Divide by 2, and round up. This is the Strength
Damage die code.

Improving Attributes
With the exception of Extranormal and Funds, the attributes you
choose for your character usually represent her maximum potential.
Most of the time, you’ll improve your character’s attributes by training in one particular aspect (improving skills), through temporary
means (taking drugs), or with implanted equipment. Nonetheless,
some freak industrial accident or bio-manipulation experiment might
provide you with a reason to improve your character’s base attributes.
(Some characters, such as kids, might start with fewer attribute dice,

Effects of Character Options
—
When determining how many Character Points a player
needs to improve his character’s skills and attributes, ignore
any modiﬁers provided by Advantages, Disadvantages, or

Chapter 3

but their excuse for their attributes’ improvement is puberty.) There
are two ways to do this.
The ﬁrst way is how kids improve their normal attributes and how
everyone improves their Extranormal attributes. The gamemaster may
chose to use this option for adult characters who want to increase their
normal attributes.
In the ﬁrst method, to boost an attribute by one pip costs 10 times
the number before the attribute’s “D” in Character Points. Generally,
a single attribute may be raised only one pip per adventure, though
it’s possible that the eﬀects of the situation inﬂuence the character’s
physical makeup for a while or the gamemaster may decide that the
situation was so life-changing that more than one attribute may be
boosted by more than one pip.
There is an upper limit using this method: Every time an adult
character boosts a normal attribute, the player rolls that attribute’s
new die code and the gamemaster rolls one die less than the maximum
die code for the species, including any appropriate Special Abilities.
(The maximum for all attributes except Extranormal and Funds is 5D,
unless altered by a Special Ability, so the gamemaster would roll 4D.)
If the gamemaster’s roll equals or exceeds the player’s roll, the attribute
improves. If it does not, the attribute does not improve, the character
gets half the Character Points back, and the character has reached her
upper limit for that attribute. Ignore this upper limit rule for Extranormal and Funds attributes.
In the second way, the gamemaster requires all adult characters to
take the Increased Attribute Special Ability (discussed in the “Character
Options” chapter) in order to improve their physical and mental attributes.
There is no maximum with this method, aside from whatever roleplaying
or adventure obstacles the gamemaster decides to include.

Improving Body Points
As a character’s Physique goes up or is altered by Special Abilities or
Disadvantages, you’ll need to change the Body Points amount. Roll the
dice indicated by the Special Ability or Disadvantage (if applicable),
and add any pips or other modiﬁer. Then add or subtract, as dictated
by the Special Ability or Disadvantage, that number from the Body
Points total.

Improving Wounds
As a character’s Body Points go up or down, the Wound
level changes. For characters who rely solely on Wounds,
the only way to alter how quickly or slowly the character
reaches each level is by changing his damage resistance total.
This could be through a change in Physique or by acquiring
more protective gear or protecting Special Abilities.

Gaining and Losing
Character Options
As players take their characters through adventures and develop
them, they may decide that the Advantages, Special Abilities, and
Disadvantages the characters started with don’t ﬁt the current concept.
To be ﬂexible, there are ways you can accommodate your players’ desire

to grow their characters. For example, an “enemy” might eventually
be killed, a character might be able to negotiate a way out of Debt, or
an Advantage Flaw might be “repaired.”
Getting rid of and gaining Advantages, Special Abilities, and Disadvantages should only happen after the character has been used during
several adventures and has had a chance to come up with reasons for
character alteration.
These game mechanics for gaining Advantages, Special Abilities,
and Disadvantages apply only to individuals who seek to have them.
Because of an adventure or series of adventures, the members of a
group may each acquire the same new Advantage or Disadvantage.
In this case, each hero does not pay the cost or receive any Character
Point beneﬁts outlined here. The new Advantage can be considered a
reward for participating in the team and the scenario, while the new
Disadvantage would be a penalty.

Advantages
There are two methods for acquiring new Advantages: (1) The player
pays, in Character Points, 5 times the rank of the Advantage. (2) The
player takes an equivalent amount of dice in Disadvantages and pays
a number of Character Points equal to the rank of the Advantage. In
either case, the player must come up with a well-crafted story for getting
the new Advantage that’s backed by actual experiences in one or more
adventures. The story, and its related Advantage, must be approved by
the gamemaster.
Generally, a player may not remove an Advantage from a character,
but it might be lost in the course of roleplaying due to player negligence
(that is, continuously bad roleplaying or ignoring Disadvantages) or
some tragic game-world mishap (such as a Patron’s city being destroyed).
If the loss occurred through no fault of the character, the gamemaster
may give the player a consolation gift of three Character Points per rank
in the Advantage, or may substitute an equally valuable Advantage.
Gamemasters should not reward the loss of an Advantage through
player negligence.

Disadvantages
There are also two methods for permanently overcoming a Disadvantage: (1)
The player pays 10 times the die code of
the Disadvantage. (2) The player loses an
equal number of Advantages and pays a
number of Character Points equal to the
die code of the Disadvantage. As with
Advantages, the player must have a
good tale and adequate adventuring
experience before the gamemaster
should approve the loss of any
Disadvantage.
Example: If a character had Equipment (R3),
he might also have a Rank 3 Disadvantage tied to it. If
the character can get rid of the equipment (which he might not
be able to do in some settings — a cursed sword or a cybernetic spine,
for example), then the Disadvantage goes away.

Improving Characters
When a player wishes to add another Disadvantage to her hero,
she receives an immediate bonus for this choice if she isn’t using the
Disadvantage to help her get a new Advantage. For the new Disadvantage, the character receives a number of Character Points
equal to 3 times the die code of the Disadvantage. However,
the hero now has a new limitation to contend with!

Special Abilities
Unless the gamemaster decides to reward a character
with a Special Ability, it costs 5 times the sum of the
Special Ability’s base cost plus the current number of
ranks in Character Points — and a really good excuse
— to acquire or improve a Special Ability after character
creation. A character may improve a Special Ability by
only one rank after each adventure, unless there is some
compelling reason to allow otherwise. Gamemasters
may disallow increases in Special Abilities if they feel the
reason for the improvement isn’t good enough.
Example: A character has Accelerated Healing at Rank 1. She decides
to spend some time in a monastery, learning how to improve it. The
cost in Character Points to increase her Special Ability to Rank 2 is 16
(5 times the sum of the base cost of 3 plus the current rank of 1).
Characters can have their Special Abilities weakened and occasionally even lose them entirely, and they get no reward for this. In other
circumstances, the character could wish to use all his mental and spiritual
resources to defeat an otherwise unstoppable force.
In these instances, by sacriﬁcing one rank in a Special Ability, a
character receives in Character Points 2 times the base cost of the
Special Ability. If the player wants to remove completely a Special
Ability from the character, however, he reduces the Special Ability to
one rank, receiving Character Points for each rank lost, as above. In
sacriﬁcing the ﬁnal rank of the Special Ability, the character receives
in Character Points 7 times the initial cost of the Special Ability. Costs
of Enhancements and Limitations are ignored. The character also, of
course, loses all Enhancements and Limitations associated with that
Special Ability when he permanently sacriﬁces it. (Getting the Special
Ability back requires the character to spend Character Points for it as
a new Special Ability.)
The act of losing Special Abilities does not typically count as an
action. Even so, some circumstances may justify a Moderate willpower
roll or the character’s complete concentration for a full round to simulate
the character summoning his deep inner resources.
The player can combine losing Special Abilities with gaining Special
Abilities to simulate an event that alters the character’s extraordinary
abilities completely. In this case, if the gamemaster accepts the player’s
explanation, simply trade the hero’s current Special Abilities for Character
Points and spend them on the desired new Special Abilities.

Gaining and Losing Special Ability
Enhancements and Limitations
It is possible for a character to gain or lose control over a Special
Ability, beyond what increases in skill and Special Ability rank allow.

•

Page 45

Unlike Advantages and Disadvantages, Special Ability Enhancements
and Limitations are fundamental to a Special Ability’s manifestation in
a character or item. Enhancements and Limitations must be purchased
or overcome with Character Points, representing the character’s
greater understanding of the Special Ability. Also, the
gamemaster may not allow some Limitations to be bought oﬀ without an excellent plot-related explanation, especially
if the Limitation is physical in nature.
Unless the Enhancement or Limitation
relates to the character’s understanding of the
Special Ability, such as many Minor Stigmas,
a reasonable explanation of how the Special
Ability has changed is also required.
Gaining a new Enhancement costs 8 times
the desired rank times the base cost of the
Enhancement in Character Points. Although most
Enhancements have several possible ranks that can
be purchased in stages, common sense should apply.
A Special Ability may obtain new levels for the same Enhancement,
but the nature of previously added Enhancements cannot be altered,
unless the Enhancements are removed.
Example: An Enhancement that provides an additional eﬀect must be
purchased at the full cost of each desired eﬀect. A player could not, for
instance, buy the one rank of energy sustenance for Attack Resistance,
and then later spend more Character Points to increase the Enhancement
rank and change it to attack reﬂection. However, a character with an
additional eﬀect of stickiness on the Natural Ranged Weapon Special
Ability could purchase additional ranks of the Enhancement.
Eliminating a Limitation costs 10 times the die code of the Limitation in Character Points. As with Enhancements, it is possible to buy
oﬀ a Limitation in stages, if the stages are related. The Debt Limitation
probably couldn’t be bought down one level at a time, but a Flaw with
multiple ranks could be, if the Narrator allowed. The gamemaster may
disallow buying oﬀ certain variations of Limitations because they are
inextricably tied to the related Special Ability.
A character can also remove an Enhancement or acquire a Limitation after character creation. A character who purposely removes an
Enhancement from a Special Ability receives 4 times the rank times the
base cost of the Enhancement in Character Points. The character can’t
rely on the Enhancement until the player buys it again. A character who
takes a Limitation for a Special Ability after character creation gains
5 times the rank times the base cost of the Limitation in Character
Points. Since it is unlikely (though not impossible) that a character
would do either of these deliberately, the player must come up with
a reasonable explanation for how the Special Ability has become less
useful. Again, the gamemaster may take away Enhancement or Limitations based on the adventure situation and does not necessarily have
to award points for it.

CHAPTER FOUR

Game Basics
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter deﬁnes how to play the game, from rolling the dice
to using skills. The basic unit of game time, order of play, and what
players can have their characters do on a turn are explained. Suggestions for determining the diﬃculty of actions are oﬀered, including
some examples.
The introduction oﬀered an overview of how the game works, so
some of this may look familiar. However, this chapter clariﬁes a lot of
special situations that will undoubtedly come up during play.

Rolling Dice
A die code shows how good a character is in a particular area, how
harmful a weapon is, how useful a Special Ability or tool is, and so on.
Each die code (also known as a value) indicates the number of six-sided
dice you roll (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, etc.), and sometimes an added
bonus of “+1” or “+2” — referred to as pips — you add to the total
result you roll on the dice.
An Advantage, Special Ability, or piece of equipment may provide
a bonus to the roll. If the bonus is in the form of a die code (such as
+1D), then you add the listed number of regular dice to the amount
you would roll. If the bonus is in the form of a number (such as +2),
then you add the amount to the total that you rolled on the dice.
Example: A shovel adds 1D to digging attempts. A character who
decides to dig a hole uses her lifting skill. If your character has a lifting skill of 4D, you would roll ﬁve dice to determine how well your
character dug the hole with the shovel.

Wild Die
Whenever any player, including the gamemaster, makes any roll, one
of the dice must be diﬀerent from the rest (in size or color). Designated
as the Wild Die, this odd die represents the vagaries of life — like the
direction of the wind aﬀecting the ﬂight of a bullet — that are too
small to warrant their own diﬃculty modiﬁers.
Example: Your character’s Reﬂexes attribute is 3D+1, so if your
character tried to jump onto a table, you would roll two regular dice
and one Wild Die.
If the player has only 1D to roll, then that one die is always the
Wild Die.
If the player rolls a 6 on the Wild Die, this is called a Critical Success
and she may add the 6 to her total and roll the Wild Die again. As long
as she turns up Critical Successes on that die, she may continue to add

them to her total and continue to roll. If she rolls anything other than
a 6, she adds that number to the total and stops rolling.
If the player rolls a 1 on the initial toss of the Wild Die, this is called
a Critical Failure, and the gamemaster may chose one of two options
for the result, depending on the gravity of the situation.
1. The Critical Failure cancels out the highest roll. Then the player
adds the remaining values, and the roll is determined normally.
2. Add the dice results normally, but a complication occurs. The
gamemaster gauges the signiﬁcance of the complication by the total
generated — from a funny, “nearly didn’t do it” result for a high total
to a serious, “we have a problem” obstacle for a low total.
When using the second option, make certain the complication chosen
relates to the task attempted. It should serve as an extra, minor obstacle
the characters must now deal with or, more often, as a place to insert
a bit of comic relief. Only on rare occasions (such as numerous poor
decisions by the players) should a complication be without solutions or
even deadly. The complications can also serve as opportunities to bring
nearly invincible characters down to a more reasonable level.
Note: Unlike rolling a Critical Failure initially on the Wild Die,
no complications occur when a 1 shows up on later tosses of the Wild
Die in the same roll.

Improving a Roll
The average person fails at average activities nearly half of the time.
Characters aren’t average people, so they need ways to beat those odds.
Thus, they have Character and Fate Points, which represent those
surges of adrenaline, sudden insights, and other unexplained helpful
acts of chance.
Players may not trade Character Points for Fate Points, nor may
they trade Fate Points for Character Points. A player may only spend
her Character and Fate Points on her character’s rolls. She may not
spend more Character or Fate Points than the character has listed

Alternate Dice Rolling Option
—
Some gamemasters prefer rolling fewer dice. To this end, a
die code simpliﬁcation chart has been included in an appendix
of this book. It oﬀers two solutions for reducing the number of

Game Basics
on her sheet. Except when allowed
by the gamemaster for exceptionally
cinematic situations, players may not
use Character Points and Fate Points
on the same roll.

Fate Points
Each players’ character has a personal moral code, generally involving
a sense of honor and justice. The devotion to this code is represented
by Fate Points. Violating that code takes a little bit away from that
nature, which is represented by a loss of Fate Points.
Example: Heroic characters receive Fate Points for doing good, such
as protecting innocents, bringing an evil character to justice (regardless
of the justice system’s ﬁnal decision), preventing damage, and saving
a life (except the character’s own). Heroic characters lose Fate Points
for performing evil actions, such as stealing, maliciously destroying
property, taking a life, and other terrible acts, especially if they use
Fate Points to accomplish that harm.
Individual ethical codes may diﬀer from the heroic code, but the more
well-deﬁned the code is, the easier it is for the gamemaster to determine
when to reward Fate Points — and when to take them away.
When a player feels she needs even greater help for her roll, she
may spend a Fate Point to double the number of dice she normally

Page 47

gets for that roll. However, the player
only rolls one Wild Die. Furthermore,
anything that’s not part of the character — weapon damage die codes,
equipment bonuses, and so on — is
not doubled.

Character Points
Whenever a player makes any roll
(attribute, skill, damage, Special Ability, and so on), he has the option to
spend Character Points to increase the
total rolled. He may spend one Character Point for each extra Wild Die
rolled, to a maximum decided upon
by the gamemaster and based on the
challenge level of the adventure. (For
adventures with easy challenges, the
maximum is two; for more cinematic
adventures, the maximum is ﬁve; for
universe-shaking ones, the maximum
is unlimited.)
A player may choose to spend
Character Points before or after he
makes a roll — or both — but always
before the gamemaster determines
the result. The gamemaster need not tell the player
whether he should spend more points to improve a roll.
Extra Wild Dice gained from spending Character Points each
work like a normal Wild Die except that a Critical Failure counts as
a 1; it does not adversely aﬀect the roll. Because of the special nature
of Character Point Wild Dice, the player may wish to roll these dice
separately from his normal Wild Die.
Once used, the character loses the point. Players get Character
Points for their characters by overcoming obstacles, roleplaying well,
and having fun. They can also use Character Points to improve skills
(see the “Improving Characters” chapter for details).

•

Example: Your character has a demolitions skill with a die code of 4D+2.
Normally, you would roll three regular
dice and one Wild Die and add two pips
to the total. But this time, you want to
make sure the villain’s car doesn’t ever
move, so you spend a Fate Point. This
allows you to roll seven regular dice and
one Wild Die and add four pips to the
total (for a total of 8D+4, or twice what
you’d normally roll).
Usually, a player may use only one
Fate Point per roll per round, though a
character may improve several diﬀerent
actions in a round with Fate Points.
Particularly beneficial or malicious
deeds presented and roleplayed well by
the player or gamemaster may warrant
additional Fate Point expenditures. In the
general course of play, a Fate Point is useful for one roll only. However,
once per game session, a player may choose to spend a Fate Point climactically, which doubles all of the character’s rolls for that round. The
gamemaster also may allow players to spend Fate Point climactically
several times during the highest point of the adventure (the climax),
even if it takes place over multiple game sessions.
Players may only spend Fate Points before making a roll. Furthermore, double the initial number before applying any die code penalties
and bonuses.
Once used, the character loses the Fate Point — but she may earn
it back at the end of the game if it was used for a deed that supported
her moral code. However, if the character used a Fate Point to go
against her moral code, the gamemaster may decide that it costs an
additional Fate Point.
As characters become more experienced, the gamemaster may
include further restrictions on Fate Point use. Gamemasters might
allow moderately experienced characters (those with at least 6D in
several skills) to spend Fate Points only on actions that promote the
story line, while highly experienced characters (those with at least 9D
in several skills) might be permitted to use Fate Points only during
climactic moments in the campaign.

Using Skills
At those times when there’s a chance that a character may fail at an
action, that character must make a skill check. The player decides what
she wants her character to do and which skill is best for accomplishing
the task (sometimes with the help of the gamemaster). The gamemaster
determines a suitable diﬃculty number, which the player must meet or
beat by rolling the number of dice in the skill and adding the results.

Untrained Skill Use
If a character doesn’t have dice in the skill required to attempt an
action, she generally may use the die code of the attribute under which
that skill falls. This is sometimes referred to as defaulting to the attribute
or using the skill untrained or unskilled. The gamemaster may include
an unskilled modiﬁer to the diﬃculty. This modiﬁer takes into account
that people who aren’t trained or don’t have experience in certain tasks
usually have a harder time doing them. Typically, this modiﬁer is +5,
but it could be as low as +1 for simple tasks or much higher for complex
plans. The gamemaster may rule that some situations, such as building
a spaceship or performing brain surgery, are impossible for anyone to
attempt without the proper training and the correct skills.
When attributes are given in the text along with the skill, such as
in spell descriptions, resisting Wounds, and so on, do not apply the
untrained modiﬁer. This also includes most uses of dodge and brawling
in combat situations, attempts to ﬁnd clues in a room with search, and
resisting interaction attempts or mental attacks with willpower.

Alternate Attribute Option
Sometimes it makes more sense to base a skill on a diﬀerent attribute
than the one it’s under by default. In such cases as the gamemaster
designates, subtract the skill value from the attribute value to get the
number of skill adds. Then add those skill adds to the new attribute
and roll away. Some example alternate skill-attribute combinations
(and the reason for using each attribute) include:
• Climbing, jumping, running, swimming: Physique for distance;
Reﬂexes for obstacles
• Command: Presence for leading others; Knowledge for determining tactics
• Disguise: Perception for creating the disguise, especially on someone
else; Presence for pulling oﬀ a disguise
• Flying: Physique for wings or to represent the physical strain of
rapid movement; Reﬂexes for obstacles
• Medicine: Knowledge for information and diagnosing; Coordination for performing surgery
• Security: Knowledge for information and recognizing systems;
Perception for installing systems

Game Time
Generally, time in a roleplaying game doesn’t matter too much. A
character may spend several hours searching a library, though only a minute
passes as far as the players and gamemaster are concerned. To keep the
story line moving, sometimes it’s necessary to skip the tedious parts.
More intense scenes require more detail. In these cases, time slows
to units of ﬁve seconds called rounds. Each character may take one
action in the round with no penalty. Unless the character has special
skills or abilities, additional actions increase the diﬃculty of performing each task; this concept is dealt with later, in the “Multi-action
Penalty” section. Once a round ends, the next one begins, continuing
until the scene ends (with the task completed, the opponent subdued,
and so on).
Since all characters in a scene are making actions in the same ﬁvesecond round, the actual length of game time taken up by an action is
usually less than ﬁve seconds. This is obviously the case when a single
character is performing multiple actions, but it is also true when one
character reacts to what another character is doing. Actions in rounds
are not simultaneous (actions out of rounds sometimes are).

Initiative
Once rounds have been declared and depending on the situation, the
gamemaster applies one of three methods to determine in what order
everyone goes. Determining initiative does not count as an action.

Method 1
The ﬁrst method is to allow whoever makes the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
action (such as those surprising other characters in an ambush) to
act ﬁrst in the rounds. The characters retain the same order until the
scene ends.

Methods 2 and 3
The other two ways start out the same, by requiring the characters
involved to make Perception rolls to generate initiative totals. The
gamemaster makes one Perception roll for each character or group of
characters he controls, depending on the number and how important
each character is to the adventure. The character with the highest roll
takes her action ﬁrst. The character with the second highest roll then
takes his action, and so on. After the last character performs her action,
the round ends and a new one begins. Note that a character rendered
unconscious, immobile, or otherwise unable to act loses his action for
that round if he hasn’t taken it already.
The gamemaster may chose then to have everyone roll initiative
once for the entire scene (the faster method) or roll at the beginning
of each round (the more realistic yet slower way).
The gamemaster and players may use Character Points, but not
Fate Points, to increase their initiative rolls if they want. Spending one
Character Point, for example, allows the player or gamemaster to add
the result of one extra Wild Die roll to the initiative roll.

Ties/No Rolls
In the event of ties, or if the gamemaster chooses not to have the
players roll to determine initiative, comparing attribute and skill die

Game Basics
codes can decide the order of actions. The character with the highest
value in the characteristic goes ﬁrst, and so on. Once a character has
a spot in the order, it doesn’t change, regardless of how other characteristics compare. Ties are broken by moving to the next factor and
looking at those values. The order: (1) ability or talent that allows the
character to go ﬁrst, (2) Perception, (3) search, (4) Reﬂexes, (5) dodge,
(6) special equipment or situation that allows the character to go before
another character.

Optional Initiative Bonus
For every 2D over the base attribute in search (round down) or 4D
in Reﬂexes (round down), a character receives +1 to his initiative roll.
Every six ranks in a Skill Bonus or Increased Attribute Special Ability
that aﬀects Reﬂexes or search provides a +1 bonus.

Performing Actions in Rounds
A character does not need to declare what she intends to do until
her turn comes up in the round. Once the character decides to take
her turn, she may use as many actions as she wants, but her player
must decide on the total number of actions that the character wishes
to take in that round, which is used to ﬁgure the multi-action penalty (see the next section for details). The character does not need to
declare when determining the number of actions what she intends to
do with all of them.
Note that waiting counts as an action (once per each time the
character wishes to wait). The character may take no additional actions
once the multi-action penalty is ﬁgured. Any actions calculated into
the multi-action penalty but that the character did not use by the end
of the round are lost.
A character may take a few actions, wait, take a few more, wait
again, and so on, as long as the player has declared a suﬃcient number
of actions in which to do everything she wants her character to do
(including waiting).
A character may only interrupt another character’s action if she has
waited and after that character has made the skill roll and spent any
points but before the gamemaster declares the result.
Example: A character surprises a thug. Because she got the jump on
him, the gamemaster decides the character may act ﬁrst in this round.
The character decides to wait and see what the thug will do, choosing
to take one other action this turn. The thug takes a swing at her, so the
character decides to dodge. If the character has no ability that gives her
extra actions, she may take only one action without penalty. She used
that one action on waiting. When she makes her dodge roll, it’s at -1D,
because it’s the second action she’s taking this round.
Only a few instances exist in which the gamemaster may permit
a character to “move up” her turn and react to another character’s
actions. These include catching a thrown object, resisting certain
mental attempts, and other situations that the gamemaster deems
appropriate. These do take the character’s action, though the player
can declare that her character will perform multiple actions in the
round. For the most part, having a turn later in the round than
another’s simply means that another character could take advantage
of the situation faster.

•

Page 49

Multi-action Penalty
Characters may attempt to perform several tasks in a single round,
or, if the action takes longer than one round to complete, in the same
minimum time period. The more they try to do, however, the less
care and concentration they can apply to each action. It becomes
more diﬃcult to succeed at all of the tasks. Thus, for most characters,
for each action taken beyond the ﬁrst, the player must subtract 1D
from all skill or attribute rolls (but not damage, damage resistance, or
initiative rolls). Thus, trying to do four actions in one round gives the
character a -3D modiﬁer to each roll. For characters with an ability
that increases their base number of actions, the multi-action penalty
doesn’t take eﬀect until the character uses up his allotment of actions.
For example, if a character with an action allotment of eight per round
wants to do nine actions, each of the nine actions is at -1D.
Only equipment and weapons suited for quick multiple actions may
be used several times (up to the limit of their capabilities) in a round.
Some examples include semi-automatic guns or items with little or no
reload time, like hands or small melee weapons.
A character may not rely on any skill or attribute reduced to zero.

Actions that Take Time
Each entry on this nonexhaustive list counts as one action taking no
more than ﬁve seconds to perform. The gamemaster may decide that
certain types of actions oﬀer a bonus or special eﬀect and, thus, have
requirements to perform. The suggested skill to use with each action
is included at the end of the task’s description.

Chapter 4

•

Page 50

Bash: Hit an opponent with a blunt weapon. (melee combat)
Catch: Stop the movement of a thrown or dropped object or person.
(The catcher must act later in the round than the person doing the
throwing or dropping. This is one of the few cases where a character
may “move up” his turn.) (throwing)
Choke: Grab a person’s neck and gripping tightly. (brawling)
Communicate: Relay plans or exchange complex ideas and information with other characters (more than a few words or one sentence).
(an interaction skill or only roleplaying)
Disarm: Remove an object from an opponent’s hand. This action is
treated as a called shot. (brawling, marksmanship, melee combat, missile
weapons, throwing)
Dodge: Actively evade an attack. (dodge)
Entangle: Throw an entangling weapon at an opponent. (throwing)
Escape: Break a hold. (lifting)
Grab: Latch onto an opponent. Depending on where the opponent
was grabbed, he can take other actions. (brawling)
Kick: Strike out at an opponent with a foot. (brawling)
Leap: Jump over an opponent or onto a table or any other such
maneuver. (jumping)
Lunge: Stab forward with a pointed weapon, such as a sword or a
knife. (melee combat)
Move: Maneuver 51% of the character’s Move or more around
the area. The gamemaster should call only for a roll if the terrain is
challenging or the maneuvering complex. During some rounds, the
gamemaster may decide that existing factors dictate all movement,
regardless of length, require an action. (running, swimming)
Parry: Block an opponent’s blow. (brawling, melee combat)
Pin: Trap an opponent by either holding him to the ground or
tacking a piece of his clothing to a wall or other nearby object. When
pinning the whole opponent, this is the same concept as tackling.
Pinning prevents the victim from using the fastened part. (brawling,
melee combat, missile weapons, throwing)
Punch: Strike out at an opponent with a ﬁst. (brawling)
Push: Forcibly move an opponent. (brawling)
Ready a Weapon: Draw or reload a gun or bow, unsheathe a knife,
and similar actions. This generally does not require a skill roll, but the
gamemaster may chose to require one related to the weapon in question
for particularly stressful situations.
Run Away: Flee from the scene. (running)
Shoot: Fire a missile or projectile weapon. (marksmanship, missile
weapons)
Slash: Swing an edged weapon. (melee combat)
Switch a Weapon or Equipment’s Setting: Although rare, some
weapons and equipment have more than one damage or eﬀect setting.
It takes an action to change the setting. This generally does not require
a skill roll, but the gamemaster may chose to require one related to the
item in question for particularly stressful situations.
Tackle: Bodily overcome an opponent. Once tackled, the opponent
can do no other physical actions other than speak or attempt to break
the attacker’s grip. (brawling)
Throw a Weapon or Object: Toss something at an opponent.
(throwing)

Trip: Quickly force one or both of an opponent’s legs upward.
(brawling)
Use a Skill or Ability: Perform a quick action related to a Special
Ability the character possesses or a skill he wants to use. A character
may not use a Special Ability he does not have, though he may use a
skill he has no experience in (possibly at a penalty). Note that some

Game Basics
skills and Special Abilities take longer than one action or one round to
perform, so trying to do them in ﬁve seconds incurs penalties.
Vehicle Maneuver: Perform a stunt in a moving vehicle.
(piloting)
Waiting: Watch for a better opportunity to perform an action. This
does not require a skill roll, but it does take concentration.

Free Actions
Free actions are anything a character can automatically perform
except under the most extreme conditions. They don’t require a skill
roll or much eﬀort. If the gamemaster thinks a task requires concentration (and has a possibility of failure, thus requiring a skill roll), it’s
not a free action.
A few examples of free actions include:
• speaking a few words to someone nearby
• a quick glance around a room (and possibly a roll of Perception)
• moving 50% or less of the character’s Move over an easy area or
up to a meter over more challenging terrain
Additionally, the following player actions do not count as character
actions:
• determining initiative
• rolling to resist damage
• rolling willpower or Presence to determine the emotional eﬀects
of the environment on the character

Related Skills
In some situations, two or more skills seem to suit the task at
hand. The gamemaster can declare that only one is suitable for the
current circumstances. Or he can choose the primary one and decides
which other skills are appropriate secondary, or related, skills that the
character can use to improve his chances with the primary skill. The
gamemaster sets diﬃculties for each skill. The character ﬁrst performs
the related skills, and then he attempts the primary one.
To determine the related skill’s modiﬁer to the primary skill, the
gamemaster subtracts the diﬃculty from the total rolled with the related
skill; this determines the number of result points from the roll. Then he
divides that number by 2, rounding up, to get the modiﬁer to the total
rolled with the primary skill. The minimum related skill modiﬁer is 1.
If the skill total was less than the diﬃculty, the modiﬁer is subtracted
from the primary skill total. If the skill total was equal to or greater than
the diﬃculty, the modiﬁer is added to the primary skill total.
The character may perform the related skills and the primary skill
successively, but the related skill modiﬁer is only good for the one
initially intended attempt and the character must make that attempt
within a short time of using the other skills. Should the character decide
to perform the primary skill and the related skill at the same time, he
takes the multi-action penalty.
Example: Your character has to carefully place some charges on a
wall. You decide that the character ﬁrst examines the wall for weaknesses
(using the search skill). Once examination has been completed and the
search roll has been made, you apply the modiﬁer to your demolitions
roll only, which must take place immediately after your character’s
examination of the wall.

•

Page 51

Gamemasters also can use the related-skills guidelines for deciding
how well one person can help another person.

Preparing
A character willing to spend twice as much time to complete a task
receives a +1D bonus for the die roll for every doubling of time, up to
a maximum bonus of +3D. However, the character can do nothing else
or be otherwise distracted (such as getting shot at) during this time.

Rushing
A character can also attempt to perform an action that normally
requires two or more rounds (10 seconds or more) in less time. The
diﬃculty increases depending on how much less time the character
puts into the task: +5 for 25% less time, +10 for 50% less time, and
+20 for 75% less time. A character may not perform any task in less
than 75% of the normally needed time. Thus, to rush an hour-long
surgery into 30 minutes, the diﬃculty increases by +10.
Of course, not every task can be rushed. If in doubt, the gamemaster should ask the player to justify how the character can speed
up the task.

Groups
To save time, gamemasters may chose to roll one action for a group
of characters he controls. Any number can belong to
the group. Each member of the group does not have
to perform exactly the same maneuver, but they do
need to take similar actions. A gamemaster could
make one roll for a pack of wolves who attack diﬀerent
characters, but he would have to separate the pack into
those attacking and those circling if the gamemaster wanted
to have them perform those distinctly diﬀerent activities.

Choosing Difﬁculties
There are two possibilities for assigning diﬃculties to a speciﬁc
action: a diﬃculty number or an opposed roll. Generally, the adventure
speciﬁes the diﬃculty and what skill is needed, but the gamemaster
may come across circumstances that were not foreseen. In such cases,
use these guidelines to decide what to do.
Certain circumstances (typically involving a character attempting a
task without a force actively opposing her, such as climbing a wall or
piloting a boat) may call for a static diﬃculty number. In these cases,
select a standard diﬃculty or use a special diﬃculty. Circumstances
involving an actively opposing force call for an opposed diﬃculty.

Standard Difﬁculties
A standard diﬃculty is a number that the gamemaster assigns to an
action based on how challenging the gamemaster thinks it is. Existing
conditions can change the diﬃculty of an action. For instance, walking
has an Automatic diﬃculty for most characters, but the gamemaster
may require someone who is just regaining the use of his legs to make
a Very Diﬃcult running roll to move even a few steps.
The numbers in parentheses indicate the range of diﬃculty numbers
for that level.

Chapter 4

Automatic (0): Almost anyone can perform this action; there is no
need to roll. (Generally, this diﬃculty is not listed in a pre-generated
adventure; it is included here for reference purposes.)
Very Easy (1–5): Nearly everyone can accomplish this task.
Typically, only tasks with such a low diﬃculty that are crucial to the
scenario are rolled.

Special Difﬁculties
There are two special and optional diﬃculties: Wild Die Only
and derived.

Wild Die Only: The standard diﬃculty of an action may be so much
lower than a character’s skill value that rolling and totaling dice would
waste time. However, the gamemaster may feel that the situation is

Generic Standard
Difﬁculties —

Opposed Difﬁculties

An opposed diﬃculty (also called an opposed roll) applies when one
character resists another character’s action. In this case, both characters
generate skill totals and compare them. The character with the higher
value wins, and ties go to the initiator of the action.
In an opposed task, since both characters are actively doing something, both the initiator and the resisting character use up actions. This
means that the resisting character can only participate in an opposed
task either if he waited for the initiating character to make a move or if
he was actively preparing for the attempt. Otherwise, the gamemaster
may allow a reaction roll of the appropriate skill as a free action in
some circumstances, or he may derive a diﬃculty equal to 2 times the
target’s appropriate opposing skill.

Derived: Any
time one character does something to another character or animate
creature or object, the base diﬃculty equals 2 times the target’s relevant
opposing attribute or skill and add the pips. Gamemasters may further
modify derived values, as the situation warrants. Derived values do not
get the unskilled modiﬁer if they are determined from the governing
attribute.
Example: Your character attempts to intimidate a thug. The gamemaster could use the standard intimidation diﬃculty of 10 or she could
derive one from the thug’s willpower skill, or, if he doesn’t have one,
the governing attribute, Presence. If his Presence has a die code of 3D,
then the base derived diﬃculty is 6.

climbing).

Generic Modiﬁers

Gamemaster’s Fiat

The modiﬁers oﬀered in a skill’s list or a pre-generated adventure
may not cover all the gamemaster’s needs. When conditions arise for
which there aren’t pre-established modiﬁers, use the chart herein to
help at those times. Gamemasters can add these modiﬁers to opposed,
standard, or derived diﬃculty values.

The rules are a framework upon which the gamemasters and their
friends build stories set in fantastic and dynamic worlds. As with most
frameworks, the rules work best when they show the least, and when
they can bend under stress. Keeping to the letter of the rules is almost
certainly counterproductive to the whole idea of making an engaging
story and having fun. To keep a story ﬂowing with a nice dramatic
beat, gamemasters might need to bend the rules, such as reducing the
signiﬁcance of a modiﬁer in this situation but not in another one, or
allowing a character to travel a meter or two beyond what the movement rules suggest.

Good Roleplaying Modiﬁer
Gamemasters should reward good roleplaying by lowering the
diﬃculty a few points. The better the roleplaying — and the more
entertaining the player makes the scenario — the higher the modiﬁer
the gamemaster should include.

Unskilled Attempts
Remember that someone without training or experience might, with
blind luck, do better than someone with experience — but generally
only that one time. There is no guarantee of future success. When a
character defaults to the attribute, ﬁgure in not only a diﬃculty modiﬁer of +1, +5, or more, but also adjust the result accordingly: the result
won’t happen as precisely or stylishly as someone with skill.

Determining Success
If the total rolled on the dice is greater than the diﬃculty, the attempt
was a success. Ties generally go to the initiator of the action, but certain
circumstances dictate otherwise (such as the use of some Special Abilities or determining the amount of damage done). The description of
the ability, challenge, or activity explains the results.

Result Points
Result points refer to the diﬀerence between the skill roll and the difﬁculty. The gamemaster can use the result points to decide how well the
character completed the task; the “Result Points and Success” sidebar for
suggestions. The gamemaster may allow a player to add one-half of the
result points (rounded up) as a bonus to another skill roll or Extranormal
or Special Ability eﬀect. One-ﬁfth of the result points from an attack
roll can be included as bonus to damage. (Round fractions up.)

Second Chances
As characters tackle obstacles, they’ll ﬁnd ones that they can’t overcome initially. Gamemasters must rely on their judgment to decide
whether and when a character may try an action again. For some
actions, such as marksmanship or running, the character may try the
action again the next turn, even if she failed. For other actions, such
as repair or con, failing the roll should have serious consequences,
depending on how bad the failure was. A small diﬀerence between the
diﬃculty number and the success total means the character may try
again next round at a higher diﬃculty. A large diﬀerence means that
the character has made the situation signiﬁcantly worse. She will need
to spend more time thinking through the problem or ﬁnd someone
or something to assist her in her endeavor. A large diﬀerence plus a
Critical Failure could mean that the character has created a disaster.
She can’t try that speciﬁc task for a long time — perhaps ever. This is

Common Difﬁculties and Modiﬁers
You can ﬁnd the more commonly referenced diﬃculties listed
on the Reference Sheet at the back of this book. With these and the
generic diﬃculties and modiﬁers described previously, you can run

CHAPTER FIVE

Movement
What’s in this Chapter
Getting from here to there by any means – running, swimming,
ﬂying, using a vehicle, you name it – is what this chapter’s all about.

Running
The diﬃculty to cover rapidly a distance on foot is determined by
the number of extra movements the character takes. One movement
equals the character’s Move value; two movements equals twice the
Move value, and so on. For each movement beyond the ﬁrst, add 5 to
the base diﬃculty of zero.
Example: A character with a Move of 10 meters per round who
wants to move 20 meters in one round has a running diﬃculty of 5,
while a character who wants to move 40 meters has a diﬃculty of 15.
A character who fails his running roll covers only his Move or may
even trip.

Swimming
A hero’s swimming Move equals half his normal Move (rounded
up). One movement while swimming equals the swimming Move, two
movements equals twice the swimming Move, and so on. Increasing
this rate likewise increases the base diﬃculty of 5 by +5 for each movement beyond the ﬁrst. Thus, the diﬃculty for a character to move 2
times his swimming speed is 10 (5 for the base diﬃculty plus 5 for the
additional movement).
Without preparation, a character may hold his breath for a number
of seconds equal to 5 times a roll of his Physique or stamina. Preoxygenating his lungs gives a character a bonus. The maximum any
character can hold his breath with preparation is a roll of his stamina
in minutes, though this requires having the stamina skill. The bonus
should be much less for the average person.

Climbing
Characters who have the climbing skill can move up a surface at
their normal Move (barring adverse environmental factors) with a base
diﬃculty of 5. Those without such a skill move at half their normal
movement rate. Increasing the rate increases the diﬃculty by +10 for
each additional one-half of the base climbing Move (rounded up).
Example: A character with a running Move of 10 meters and without
the climbing skill wants to move quickly up a tree. His base climbing
Move is 5. To increase this to eight meters per round means a diﬃculty
of 20 (10 to climb the tree plus 10 to increase the movement by onehalf, or three meters, of his base climbing Move).

Additional modiﬁers can be found in the “Example Skill Diﬃculties” chapter.

Jumping
A character’s total leaping distance (vertically and horizontally) from
a standing position equals one-quarter of his Move in meters (rounded
up). The base diﬃculty is 5 to move this distance, and +10 for each
additional two meters (vertically and horizontally) the character hopes
to cover. If there is enough room, the character may try running before
jumping. The character may add 5 to his skill total per round of the
running start, up to a maximum of +10 (two rounds). The character
must have beat the running diﬃculty in both rounds in order to get
the full bonus.
Additional modiﬁers can be found in the “Example Skill Diﬃculties” chapter.

Short Distances
A character may move up to 50% of his movement rate (swimming, ﬂying, or base Move) without this counting as an action. Thus,
a character with a base Move of 10 could move ﬁve meters on land or
2.5 meters in the water with no action penalty.

Maximum Movement
Characters may perform only one movement action of each type
per round, unless a Special Ability allows them to do otherwise.
Gamemasters may choose to limit the speed at which characters may
travel to 4 times the Move rate for each type of movement.

Accelerating and Decelerating
When it becomes important to the scenario, such as a race or a
chase scene, the gamemaster may choose to include acceleration and
deceleration maximums.
A character may increase or decrease his current movement rate by
up to 2 times that rate, regardless of whether his movement roll would
allow him to travel a greater distance. The minimum increase or decrease
is 2 times the character’s base Move for that type of movement.
Example: A character with a base walking Move of 10 has minimum
swimming change of 10 — 2 times his swimming Move of 5.
Example: A character with a Move of 10 is chasing a thief, who just
swiped her pocketbook. In the ﬁrst round, she may move up to 20
meters, which has a running diﬃculty of 5. In the second round, she
can increase her speed to 40 meters, which has a running diﬃculty of

it as the modiﬁer to a base diﬃculty of 5 when using the stamina or
willpower skill in an attempt to overcome the fatigue.

Other Movement Options
The gamemaster may include additional modiﬁers or require an
additional related skill roll for any form of movement, depending on
surrounding conditions, such as high winds, numerous obstacles, slick
surfaces, sharp turns, and so on.

15. If, in the second round, the player generates a running total of 20,
by the acceleration rules, she may only move 40 meters, even though
her running total meets the diﬃculty to move 50 meters.
Similarly, if a character does not make a movement roll that would
allow him to move at the previous round’s rate, that character automatically slows by two times his base Move. In other words, subtract
two times the base Move from the current movement rate to get the
new movement rate. If this makes the current movement zero, then
the character stops. If it’s less than zero, the character trips.
Example: The character chasing the thief increased her speed to a
rate of 40 meters per round. To maintain this speed, her player needs
to continue generating a total of 15 with the character’s running skill.
If the player gets less than 15, then her character’s speed drops to 20
meters per round (40 minus 2 times her base Move of 10).

Fatigue
Keep in mind that most characters cannot move rapidly for long
periods of time. Determine a suitable length of time depending on
existing conditions, the Physique of the character, and any relevant
Special Abilities she has. Any additional fast movement beyond that
predetermined length requires a fatigue modiﬁer of +3 to the diﬃculty
for each additional round that she continues running. The modiﬁer is
cumulative. Thus, one round beyond the maximum is +3, two rounds
is +6, and so on.
The gamemaster may use the fatigue modiﬁer for any repetitive
action performed for an extended period of time. They can also use

Vehicle actions work like normal character actions, with some
additional game mechanics for special situations.
Much of the information found in this section applies equally well
to ﬂying characters, particularly the details on stunts.

Vehicle Movement
Vehicles have ﬁve speeds of movement: stopped, cautious, cruising,
high, and all-out. They may make one movement action per round.
• Stopped: The vehicle is motionless. This requires no roll. Air vehicles
should be on the ground when at this speed level.
• Cautious: The vehicle travels at half its Move. This is generally a
free action requiring no roll, but terrain conditions may increase it from
its base diﬃculty of zero. Air vehicles at this level must be attempting
to reach a higher or lower altitude at this speed; they cannot maintain
altitude at cautious.
• Cruising: The vehicle travels at its Move. This requires an action,
but since it has a base diﬃculty of zero, the character need only roll if
movement conditions dictate otherwise.
• High: The vehicle travels at twice its Move. This requires a piloting
roll with a base diﬃculty of 5, modiﬁed by existing conditions.
• All-out: The vehicle travels at four times its Move. This requires
a piloting roll with a base diﬃculty of 10, modiﬁed by existing conditions.
Vehicles may travel anywhere between half their current speed and
the full current speed at each level. Rapid acceleration and deceleration
are considered stunts and dealt with later in this section.

Character Flying Movement
Characters who ﬂy travel at the base rate designated in the Special
Ability or equipment description. To increase this rate, use the same
rules as for running, except that the character relies on the ﬂying skill.
Characters may not use this skill unless they have a means of propelling
themselves through the air or they are in a zero-gravity environment.

Stunts
For normal vehicle use or casual ﬂying under ideal conditions, a
character need not make a skill roll. When the conditions turn less than
favorable or he decides to attempt a fancy maneuver, his piloting skill
plus the vehicle’s Maneuverability code or his ﬂying skill determines
his success.
Rapid acceleration and deceleration also warrant rolls, enhanced by
the vehicle’s Maneuverability, to see if the operator maintains control.
These maneuvers have an initial diﬃculty of 10, adjusted based on

Chapter 5

existing conditions (see the “Stunt Diﬃculties and Modiﬁers” chart
for some suggestions). A vehicle or ﬂying character may reduce or
increase movement by two levels in one round. Failing this roll means
that the character has lost control for one round. If some immovable
force doesn’t stop the vehicle or character during that round, he may
attempt to regain control (with a base diﬃculty of 15) on the following round.
If a character wishes to perform any other actions in addition to
piloting or ﬂying, he must make the appropriate skill rolls for all actions,
reduced by the multi-action penalty, regardless of the situation. The
base diﬃculty for normal operation becomes 5. Stunts still have their
established base diﬃculties.

Ramming and Sideswiping Vehicles
Ramming is done with the nose of a vehicle, while sideswiping is
done with its side. The character makes the appropriate vehicle roll,
including the vehicle’s Maneuverability. If the character fails the roll,
the vehicle misses and spins. Land and vehicles turn up to 180 degrees
and lose power, while space vehicles continuing spinning. The character
must then spend one round starting it or regaining control and another
getting back in the right direction. Should the character instead succeed, she keeps the vehicle reasonably straight and may try for another
sideswipe or ram on the next turn. The pilot of an air vehicle that rams
or sideswipes another vehicle automatically loses control. About the best
she can hope for is to make a successful, but rough, landing.
Both vehicles take damage (the mechanics of this are explained later
in this section) in a successful ram or sideswipe.

Vehicle Attacking and Dodging
The base diﬃculty to hit a vehicle 10, modiﬁed by distance and the
sizes of the attacker and the defender (using the scale modiﬁer listed
in the “Combat Options” chapter). That means a person shooting a
car has a +6 to his attack total, while a car sideswiping another car has
no modiﬁer.
If the driver wishes to ﬁre a weapon, he must make both an Easy
piloting roll (modiﬁed by the vehicle’s Maneuverability code) and a
marksmanship roll. Because he’s doing two actions, he also incurs a
multi-action penalty to both rolls. Passengers may shoot with few or
no penalties. (Note that these actions would not be possible in some
vehicles.)
A character may also attempt to maneuver the vehicle out of the way
of incoming projectiles or other vehicles. Instead of the dodge skill, the
character uses his piloting skill plus the vehicle’s Maneuverability code.
Use the active partial or full defense rules for characters to determine the
new defense total. The defense total becomes the new combat diﬃculty
and is in eﬀect until the character’s turn in the next round.

Vehicle Damage
When a vehicle takes damage from a weapon or another vehicle,
it’s the level of destruction that matters. Use the following guidelines
and compare the result to the “Vehicle and Passenger Damage” chart.
Modify the damage total of the attacker or the damage resistance total
of the target by the scale modiﬁer, as appropriate for the situation.

Movement
A vehicle’s damage resistance total equals its Toughness plus the
value of any armor. Character Points or Fate Points may not be spent
on this roll.
With weapons, compare the weapon’s damage total to the target’s
damage resistance total.
When vehicle collides with something else, decide how fast it was
going when it made the collision and modify it based on the circumstances of the collision. Compare that to the damage resistance total.
Should two vehicles be involved, both take damage. See the sidebar
for the speed and collision modiﬁers.

Crew and Passenger Injuries
Depending on how badly damaged the vehicle becomes, the crew
and passengers may be harmed, too. Use the “Passengers Suﬀer” column
of the “Vehicle and Passenger Damage” chart as a guideline. Adjust it
based on how much of the passengers is exposed (for example, motorcycles and canoes oﬀer little protection to their cargo).

Leaping Out of a Vehicle
Leaving a land or water vehicle moving at less than 5 miles per hour
is a Very Easy acrobatics or Reﬂexes roll (or jumping if the character leaps
from the vehicle). If the vehicle is moving faster than that, the base
diﬃculty becomes 15, with +1 added to it for every 10 kilometers per
hour the vehicle is traveling (rounded down). Additionally, the character takes damage from the fall, at a rate of 1 for every 15 kilometers
per hour the vehicle is moving (rounded up) minus the result points
from the roll.

Repairing a Vehicle

depends on the amount of damage and availability
of parts and tools. See the repair skill description

CHAPTER SIX

Combat
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter provides an extended description of one of the most
rules-intensive aspects of roleplaying: combat.
When resolving a situation calls for force, time becomes broken into
rounds, which were discussed in the last chapter. Within these rounds,
three steps occur: (1) generating initiative; (2) attacking and defending;
(3) determining damage; (4) repeating the steps, if necessary. Discover
herein what happens in each of those steps.

Step 1: Generating Initiative
As discussed in the “Game Basics” chapter, determine initiative
based on the ﬁrst signiﬁcant action or on initiative rolls. Then go on
to Step 2.

Step 2: Attacking and Defending
This is where the interesting stuﬀ happens. The person whose turn
it is gets to decide what type of action her character is going to do.
Once she chooses, she makes a skill roll.
Note that a character need not attempt to engage in combat, but
this chapter only discusses what to do if the player decides to attack,
defend, or (typically with a multi-action penalty), do both.

Base Combat Difﬁculty
The base diﬃculty to attack someone is 10 (called the target’s passive
defense value) or the target’s active defense value, modiﬁed by range
and other factors.

Active Defense
The target character can opt to use an “active defense,” which
aﬀects all attacks that occur after the defender’s turn in the current
round but before the defender’s turn the next round. Active defenses
are defensive maneuvers that the target consciously exercises, such as
dodging, blocking, or parrying. Each of these is represented by a skill
and counts as an action.
A character may make an active defenses only when his turn comes
up in the initiative line, but the total for the roll is eﬀective for all relevant attacks made against the character that occur after the character’s
current turn but before his turn in the next round.
Remember: if a character acts later in a round than the character
attempting to hit him, he cannot take his turn sooner and use an
active defense to replace the passive defense value — his reactions just
weren’t fast enough.

If the roll is lower than the passive defense value, the character has
succeeded in making himself easier to hit — by miscalculating where
the attack would be placed and actually getting in its way.
The active defense total is modiﬁed as the situation dictates.
Dodge: The character attempts to anticipate the ﬁnal location of
an attack from any source and be in another place when it comes. This
is done by rolling the dodge skill.
Block/Parry: The character attempts to stop his opponent’s attack
by intercepting it and either stopping it with a block or deﬂecting it
with a parry. The character may roll his brawling or melee combat (if he
has something in his hands) to block it. If the character uses a sharp or
energized weapon (sword or dagger, for example) to parry an unarmed
blow and is successful at the block, the attacker takes damage from
the weapon. However, do not add the defender’s Physique to the listed
weapon damage score when determining injuries inﬂicted this way.
If the opponent strikes at the character with a bladed or energized
hand weapon and the character uses any part of his body to intercept
the attack, the defender always takes the weapon’s damage total. If
the block was successful, then the attacker’s Strength Damage is not
added to the listed score. If the block was unsuccessful, then the target
character takes damage as normal. The character may avoid this aspect
by having armor, a special ability, or a suitable close combat specialization in melee parry.

Combat

Full Defense
A character who foregoes all of her actions for a round to completely
protect herself from attacks makes a full defense. The total rolled by
the skill plus 10 takes the place of the base combat diﬃculty from the
time the character makes the full defense on her turn to her turn in
the next round.
Full active defense value = any active defense skill roll + 10

Partial Defense
A character who chooses to do something else in addition to guarding
against attacks may take a partial defense. In this case, the active defense
roll replaces the base combat diﬃculty from the time the character takes
his turn in one round to his turn in the next round.
Partial active defense value = any active defense skill roll
Since the character is taking multiple actions, the multi-action
penalty applies.
The gamemaster may call for a partial defense roll (as a free action)
if he decides that the character might have a little awareness of an
impending attack, yet not enough foresight to prepare for it.

Optional Defense Modiﬁer
For every 2D in Reﬂexes or dodge above 4D (round up), a character
receives a +1 to her passive defense value. This modiﬁer does not aﬀect
the character’s active defense total. For every 2D in acrobatics above 4D
(round up), a character receives a +1 to her active or passive defense value
for attacks at Short range or greater. Every six ranks in a Skill Bonus or
Increased Attribute Special Ability that aﬀects Reﬂexes, dodge, or acrobatics
provides a +1 bonus, as speciﬁed for the skill in question.
Example: A character with 4D in Reﬂexes gets no bonus, while a
character with 7D in acrobatics has a +2 bonus.

Combat Difﬁculty Modiﬁers
Here are a few of the most frequently used modiﬁers to the combat
diﬃculty. Others are discussed in “Combat Options” chapter. Regardless of the number of modiﬁers used, the total combat diﬃculty may
never go below 3.
The gamemaster rolls the indicated modiﬁer and adds it to the
combat situation. A standard modiﬁer is included in parentheses after
the die modiﬁer, should the gamemaster prefer not to roll.
Range: The eﬀectiveness of a punch, weapon, Special Ability, or
any other attack made at a distance depends on its range. All range
modiﬁers are added or subtracted from the combat diﬃculty.
Note that, unless a special maneuver allows otherwise, characters
may use unarmed close combat attacks at Point Blank range only. In
most cases, this is true for using various melee weapons as well, though
the distance can be increased to Short range if the weapon is longer
than two meters. For instance, a character with a support beam can
whack an opponent at Point Blank or Short range.
Cover: When a target is protected by something — poor lighting,
smoke, fog, a table — it makes her harder to hit. This is represented
by a cover modiﬁer, which is added to the combat diﬃculty.

•

Page 59

Aiming: Aiming involves careful tracking of the target. Characters
may perform it against moving targets, but they cannot themselves do
anything else in the round in which they aim. Each consecutive round of
uninterrupted aiming adds 1D to the characters’s marksmanship, missile
weapons, or throwing skill, up to a maximum bonus of +3D.

Determining Success
Once the combat diﬃculty has been determined, the attacker rolls
the die code in his character’s combat skill and compares the total to

the combat diﬃculty. If it equals or exceeds the combat diﬃculty, the
attack hit, probably doing damage or having another eﬀect that the
attacker intended. If it was less than the combat diﬃculty, then the
attack missed.

Step 3: Determining Damage
If a character successfully hits his target, he may have done damage
to it. To determine the amount of injury caused, roll the damage die
code for the weapon, including any modiﬁers from a special combat
action, such as a sweep attack or hit location. Some weapons list their
score as a die code with a plus sign (“+”) in front of it; in this case,
add the damage die code to the attacker’s Strength Damage die code,
add modiﬁers, and roll. If the gamemaster chooses to use the optional
damage bonus, this is added to the total at this time.
After the player or the gamemaster has ﬁgured out how much damage is done, go to the “Damage” chapter to determine how much of
that damage the target sustained.

Determining Strength Damage
To ﬁgure the Strength Damage die code, drop the pips from the
character’s Physique or lifting die code (but include any relevant Disadvantages or Special Abilities), divide the number by 2, and round up.
The Increased Attribute: Physique Special Ability aﬀects the total.
Example: A character with 3D in Physique has a Strength Damage of
2D. A character with 6D+2 in lifting has a Strength Damage of 3D.

Optional Damage Bonus
The combat skill roll is supposed to reﬂect the accuracy of an attack.
Therefore, gamemasters may reward high rolls for players’ characters
and signiﬁcant gamemaster characters with a bonus to damage. Subtract
the diﬃculty of the successful attack from the skill total and divide
this number by 5, rounding up. Add this damage bonus to the damage
total before comparing it to the resistance total. If the gamemaster uses
the damage bonus in combination with a called-shot hit location, the
bonus is in addition to the damage modiﬁer except for attempts on an
arm, leg, or hand. In those cases, ignore the damage bonus.
For Special Abilities and Extranormal skills that require a combat
roll to target them, the gamemaster may allow the combat roll’s damage
bonus to apply to the ability’s roll.

If the ﬁght isn’t ﬁnished after one round, then return to Step 1 in
the “Combat” chapter and do it all over again. Repeat these steps until
the ﬁght is resolved in favor of one side or the other.

Combat Summary
You can ﬁnd a summary of the information in this chapter on the
Reference Sheet included in the back of this book.

Combat Example
To give you an idea of how all this works, here’s a typical exchange
between a player’s character and one of her opponents.
Gamemaster: Okay, we’re in combat rounds now. Everyone make a
Perception roll. (All players and the gamemaster roll their dice.) Anyone
roll higher than 20?
Rachelle: Yeah, I rolled a 23!
Gamemaster: All right, what do you want to do?
Rachelle: Ah, that depends. What’re the mercs doing?
Gamemaster: As one runs across the warehouse toward you, the
other two set up some kind of large, tripod-mounted weapon near the
entrance, which is about 15 meters away from you.
Rachelle: I’m going to take two actions. First, I’ll shoot at one of the
mercs with my riﬂe, and them I’m going to dodge out of the way.
Gamemaster: Okay, you lose 1D from each action and you don’t
get the full defense bonus, since you’re taking two actions.
Rachelle: (Rolls her character’s marksmanship dice.) I rolled a 6 on the
Wild Die! (Rolls the Wild Die again.) All right: that’s a total of 21!
Gamemaster: Let’s see... he’s at Short range, which doesn’t modify
the base combat diﬃculty of 10. So, you nailed him! Roll damage.
Rachelle: (Rolls her riﬂe’s damage dice.) I rolled an 18.
Gamemaster: (Using the Wounds system, he rolls the merc’s
Physique to resist the damage.) Whoops! I rolled a 1 on the Wild Die.
That leaves a total of 2. Well, that’s 16 points over the resistance total,
putting him at the Dead level! Your riﬂe shot catches him right in the
chest and he’s thrown backward into the wall. Okay, now make your
dodge roll. (Note that if the gamemaster had decided to use the Body Points
system, the merc would not have made a resistance roll, instead taking the
full 18 points of damage.)
Rachelle: (Rolls her character’s dodge dice.) Well, I rolled a 13, but
something tell’s me that’s not going to be high enough, so I’m going
to spend a Character Point.
Gamemaster: Okay, roll another die and add it.
Rachelle: (Rolls one more die.) I rolled a 5, so that’s a total of 18.
I’ll stick with that.
Gamemaster: Okay, the mercs get to go now. The one rushing
toward you ﬁres his handgun. (Checks range and then rolls the merc’s
marksmanship dice.) That’s a 17.
Rachelle: I rolled an 18 for my dodge this round. Good thing I
spent that Character Point!
Gamemaster: That’s right. As the bullet heads straight toward you,
you just barely manage to jump out of the way. On to the next one...

CHAPTER SEVEN

Damage
What’s in this Chapter
Injury can come from all sides. This chapter describes two methods
of ﬁguring out how hurt a character is, plus a few sources of damage
other than weapons.

Body Points versus Wound Levels
The Body Points system has the advantage of a gradual fall into death
and a more noticeable healing process. It also does not require a chart,
though it can be used with Wound levels. The Wound levels system
brings the end on faster and is slower to heal. Which the gamemaster
chooses to use depends on how deadly he wants the game.
Furthermore, gamemasters should feel free further adjust the deadliness of their games. See the sidebar on page 64 for some suggestions.

Damage and Body Points
Once the player or gamemaster has her character’s damage resistance
total (see the next section), subtract the attacker’s damage total from the
target’s damage resistance total and subtract that number from the total
Body Points the character has remaining. If the gamemaster chooses,
she may compare the number of Body Points the character has remaining to the “Wound Level” table to determine what level of injury the
defender sustained and what its eﬀects on the character are.
If the damage resistance total is greater than or equal to the damage
total, the defender incurs no injuries (beyond an annoying bruise, a
shallow scrape, a light burn, or dinged protective gear).

Miscellaneous Damag

Here is a small selection

things

debilitating circumstances (such as Reduced Attribute: Physique or an

total by spending Character Points or a Fate Point on this roll.
If the character has no armor or Special Abilities, then the character
has a damage resistance total of zero, and the player makes no roll.
However, they can still spend Character Points, using them as a base
damage resistance total. Spending a Fate Point allows the player to roll
his character’s Physique. Totals determined from spending points are
adjusted as normal, including negative and positive damage resistance
modiﬁers.

Killing Blow
A killing blow by massive damage entails a damage total equal to
91% of the character’s maximum Body Points in one blow or 100%

Chapter 7

•

Page 62

of the character’s maximum Body Points in a single round. Use the
damage total after subtracting the damage resistance total to determine
whether the attack delivered a killing blow.

Stun Damage
For weapons that do stun damage, after the damage total is determined but before applying it, subtract a roll of the target’s Physique or
stamina from the damage total. If the victim suﬀers at least one point
of damage, that character goes unconscious for a number of minutes
equal to the diﬀerence between the resistance total and the original
damage total.
Equipment that does stun damage only has no eﬀect
on inanimate, nonelectrical objects, though it does tend to
disrupt electrical components.

Unconsciousness and Death
If the character’s Body Points reach a few points or he has attained
the Mortally Wounded level but the character wasn’t struck with a
killing blow, he is still gravely injured and falls unconscious. For every
minute he is at this level, his player makes a Physique roll against
a diﬃculty equal to the number of minutes the character has been
Mortally Wounded.
Suﬃcient medical aid to bring the character to at least 10% of his
maximum Body Points can possibly rescue the imperiled character. If

Wound Levels —

Damage and Wound Levels
Once the player or gamemaster has her character’s damage
resistance total (see the next section), compare the damage
total to the damage resistance total on the “Wound Level”
table to determine how much injury the defender sustained
and what its eﬀects on the character are.
If the damage resistance total is greater than or equal to
the damage total, the defender incurs no injuries (beyond
an annoying bruise, a shallow scrape, a light burn, or dinged
protective gear).

Damage Resistance Total
The resistance total equals the target character’s Physique
plus any bonuses from armor or Special Abilities (such as
Increased Attribute: Physique) minus any modiﬁers from disease, ingested poisons, or other debilitating circumstances (such
as Reduced Attribute: Physique or an appropriate Hindrance).
Do not include any Wound level modiﬁer when attempting to
resist damage. A character also may improve her resistance by
spending Character Points or a Fate Point on this roll.

Killing Blow
A killing blow by massive damage entails a Mortally Wounded
result with one blow or gaining the Dead level in a single round.
Use the damage total after subtracting the damage resistance total
to determine whether the attack delivered a killing blow.

Stun Damage
For weapons that do stun damage, after the number of
Wounds have been determined but before applying the level
modiﬁers, reduce the weapon’s damage by two Wound levels,
with a minimum level of Stunned. The character also goes
unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the diﬀerence
between the resistance total and the damage total.
Equipment that does stun damage only has no eﬀect on
inanimate, nonelectrical objects, though it does tend to disrupt
electrical components.

Damage
suitable medical aid is administered within four minutes, the character recovers without undue harm. If the medical aid is given within
four to 10 minutes, the player rolls his character’s Physique or stamina
against a diﬃculty equal to the number of minutes he was Mortally
Wounded. If the roll succeeds, the character revives but he loses 1D
from all of his skills, though the skill cannot go below the attribute’s
die code. If the medical aid is given within 10 to 15 minutes, the player
rolls his character’s Physique or stamina against a diﬃculty equal to the
number of minutes he was Mortally Wounded. If the roll succeeds, the
character revives but he loses 2D from all of his skills, though no skill
can be reduced below the attribute’s die code. In any case, should the
roll fail, the character dies.
Characters who receive their total Body Points in additional damage
after reaching zero Body Points cannot be revived (by normal means,
anyway).
Gamemasters who prefer a more rapid exit out of the mortal coil
may ignore these rules, instead declaring that once the character reaches
the Dead level or zero Body Points, the character is history.

Negative Damage Resistance Total
It is possible for the damage resistance total to be a negative number.
Spell feedback, poisons, and sickness can all contribute negative modiﬁers
that might take the damage resistance total below zero. In this case, the
character’s body is working against him, compounding the additional
damage done. Gamemasters have three options for handling this: (1)
They may use the negative damage resistance total as a positive bonus
to all diﬃculties until the character is healed. (2) They may have the
negative damage resistance total add positively to the amount of injury
caused. This is a good method for simulating gritty adventures, as well
as a way of getting low-level gamemaster’s characters out of the way. (3)
Have the damage resistance total equal zero. This last way works best
for adventures of the comic book or action ﬂick types.

Massive Damage Option
If a character incurs two Wound levels or the Body Points equivalent
within a single round, not only do the normal modiﬁers for the greatest level apply, the character also can do nothing but defend or run
away on the next two rounds. In either of these rounds, the character
may make an Easy stamina or willpower attempt, as an action, to try
to recover from the blow and shake oﬀ the penalty. If this is declared
as a multi-action for the round, then the character takes the multiaction penalty. If not, and the stamina or willpower roll is successful,
the character may act as normal in the next round.

Descriptive Damage
So a character is down by a few Body Points or has a couple of
Wound levels — so what? What does that mean in descriptive terms?

It depends on what caused the harm. The following list supplies some
general guidelines for describing what might have happened to the
character’s body when he was hurt. Use the “Wound Levels” chart to
decide on the character’s current Wound level.
Stunned: Moderate bruise or minor sprain; laceration; muscle tear;
minor dislocation of joint.
Wounded: Severe abrasion or sprain; deep laceration; torn ligaments;
major dislocation or minor break.
Severely Wounded: Broken bone; gaping wound; ripped cartilage
and muscle; concussion.
Incapacitated: Multiple fracture; laceration in vital area; heavy
concussion.
Mortally Wounded: Above options combined with multiple
internal injuries.
Dead: Broken neck; punctured lung; eviscerated.
These are just a few examples. Really interested gamemasters can
come up with charts, tables, or detailed descriptions of damage for
those players who absolutely must know. The gamemaster may also
assign diﬀerent modiﬁers than the general ones listed in the “Wound
Levels” sidebar that more appropriately indicate the type of injury
that was suﬀered.

CHAPTER EIGHT

Healing
What’s in this Chapter
There are many diﬀerent ways that characters can regain their health.
Characters may never get back more than their maximum number of
Body Points or Wounds.

Body Points
Natural Healing
The body heals naturally during the course of the day. The more rest
characters get, the faster their wounds heal. Using the “Body Points
Healing” chart, the character rolls her Physique plus a modiﬁer based
on how much rest she’s had that day. A character gets a modiﬁer of
+1D on each full day of rest (sleeping, reading, or other sedentary
activities). If she is involved in light activity, such as walking or singing,
the modiﬁer is zero. However, if most of the day is spent ﬁghting and
running, the modiﬁer is -1D. The character receives the Body Points
back at the beginning of the next day.
Optionally, the gamemaster may require an injured character to
complete a period of rest before making the natural healing roll. Use
the “Rest Period” chart and the character’s Wound level to determine
how long the character needs to wait before attempting the natural
healing roll. The gamemaster then multiplies the result by 3 to ﬁgure
out how many Body Points were healed.

Skill
Characters can heal others or themselves with some basic ﬁeld
procedures for treating wounds. Such attempts don’t require a medi-

cal kit. Simply roll medicine to help an injured comrade, and ﬁnd the
results on the “Body Points Healing” chart. A successful roll heals the
character the listed amount. A character using a medical kit may add
its bonus to the roll.
A character may only attempt to heal a patient once per day. Other
characters may also try to help the patient, adding their expertise to
the ﬁrst healer’s.

Wounds
Natural Healing
A character can heal naturally, but this process is slow. The character must rest a speciﬁed amount of time and then can make a natural
healing roll: roll the character’s full Physique and ﬁnd the result on the

chart related to the character’s current Wound level to see if the
character heals.
Healing characters can do virtually nothing but rest. Characters
who try to work, exercise, or adventure must subtract 1D from their
Physique when they makes their natural healing roll. Any character
who opts to take it easy and do virtually nothing for twice the
necessary time may add 1D to the Physique roll to heal.

Skill
Characters can heal others or themselves with some basic ﬁeld
procedures for treating wounds. Such attempts don’t require a
medical kit. Simply roll medicine to treat wounds in the ﬁeld,
and ﬁnd the results on the Assisted Healing chart.
A successful roll heals the character up one level: for instance,
a successful medicine roll on someone who’s Wounded would
bring him back to Stunned. A character using a medical kit may
add its bonus to the roll.

Medicine Modiﬁer Option
Before the beginning of the technological and pharmaceutical
boom, which started in the 1940s, medicine was handled in a
crude fashion and ideas such as sterilizing were only beginning
to catch on. To reﬂect this, gamemasters may wish to impose a
-5 penalty to the total when attempting to use the medicine skill before
the 1940s or in primitive conditions.

CHAPTER NINE

Combat Options
What’s in this Chapter
Players sometimes want their characters to do some pretty fancy
maneuvers during combat. This chapter oﬀer guidance with several
common ones.

Using the Modiﬁers
All modiﬁers listed in this chapter and in the “Combat” chapter are
cumulative, though the gamemaster doesn’t need to include all of them.
Modiﬁers may never adjust the total combat diﬃculty below 3.
The gamemaster rolls the indicated modiﬁer and adds it to the
combat situation. A standard modiﬁer is included in parentheses after
the die modiﬁer, should the gamemaster prefer not to roll.

Marksmanship Options
Burst Fire as Single: A character may perform this attack only with
a weapon capable of burst ﬁre (like an assault riﬂe) and switching to
single ﬁre. The ﬁrer ﬁres only one shot instead of a burst; it is primarily
used to conserve ammunition.
Full Auto: This attack is only possible with weapons that can ﬁre
at fully automatic settings (such as assault riﬂes, submachine guns,
and machine guns). Since the character is taking quite a bit of time to
“hold down the trigger” and pump ammo into the air, the extra “to hit”
and “damage” bonuses are somewhat compensated for by the modiﬁer
to the character’s defensive value during the round he is performing
a full auto attack.
Single Fire as Multi: The character ﬁres a weapon (such as a pistol)
several times in a round at the same target. Characters may use this
option only when a weapon automatically reloads itself after ﬁring a
single shot or when it is fairly easy to ready it for ﬁring again (such
as a .45 automatic, which puts a new cartridge in the slide as soon as
the ﬁrst one clears the barrel). It increases the character’s chance to hit
a target, as well as the damage. It does not count as a multi-action as
long as the shot is taken at the same target. One target, one die roll,
one damage total.
Sweep (Ranged): The character wants to “spray an area” with
ammo. Only characters with weapons that go full auto, burst, or single
ﬁre as multi (in general, just about any automatic weapon) can perform
this maneuver. The gun uses the amount of ammunition needed by
whichever setting is used. They gain a positive modiﬁer to hit (because
of the sheer volume of shots), but this “non-targeted” attack results in
a lower damage total.

Brawling and Melee Combat
Options
Acrobatic Tricks: Acrobatics can also enhance brawling and melee
combat attacks. The character must perform the acrobatics trick and
the attack on the same turn. The gamemaster determines the exact
diﬃculty of the acrobatics attempt. The player may add one-half of
the diﬀerence (rounded up) between the diﬃculty and the successful
acrobatics roll to the amount of damage done (not to the combat skill
roll). One acrobatics trick roll can aﬀect one attack only.
All-out Attack: The character attacks with no thought to the consequences. This maneuver increases the chance of the character striking

Lunge: The character takes a step forward to jab at an opponent,
usually with an edged weapon. This adds about a half-meter (more or
less depending on the stride) to the range of the attack, but it lowers
the eﬀectiveness of the attack.
Knockdown/Push/Trip: Using brawling or a blunt melee weapon
in the usual way, the attacker causes his target to stumble and, instead
of taking damage, the opponent loses 2D from her next Reﬂexes or
Reﬂexes-based skill roll. If this is a knockdown or trip attempt, she must
also spend one action to stand up again. Generally, unless the character
has special training, he may only knockdown or push a character whose
Physique (including Special Abilities or Disadvantage modiﬁers) is equal
to or less than his own.
Sweep (Close Combat): These attacks, usually foot sweeps or
roundhouses, are used when the character wants to make certain she
hits the target, regardless of how much injury is caused.
Tackle: Tackling is much like grabbing, except that the attacker
seeks to overcome the target entirely. Characters may perform this with
brawling only. If successful or the target chooses not to struggle, the
character captures the target and may, if desired, do normal damage.
The target, meanwhile, may make no other actions than attempt to
escape (see the escape rules herein). On subsequent rounds, the attacker
may choose to do her Strength Damage only (no modiﬁers).
Grab: The attacker physically grasps a target. Few melee weapons
allow this option, so it is used generally only in brawling attacks. What
eﬀect this has on the target depends on the type of grab. (The ones
listed here are choke, ﬂip, hold, slam/throw, and arm pin.) See the escape
rules in this chapter for details on getting out of grabs. On subsequent
rounds of a grab, attackers who defeat an escape attempt or against
a defender who chooses not to resist may do their Strength Damage
only (no modiﬁers except those from Special Abilities or equipment).
Some grab variations may oﬀer other options.
Choke: Ropes and hands can cut oﬀ the target’s source of air. Damage
on the ﬁrst round equals the character’s Strength Damage plus any modiﬁers. See the general grab rules for damage on subsequent rounds.
Flip: The character reaches out, grabs his opponent’s wrist, arm, leg,
or similar body part, and jerks violently, causing the opponent to fall to
the ground. The opponent takes 3D in damage from slamming into the
ground and must spend the next round getting to her feet (if she can).
Hold: The character does less damage (-3D or more, at the player’s
option, to the damage total), but she has hold of the target with a
successful attack.
Slam/Throw: The character grabs or picks up his opponent and hurls
him into the ground, a wall, a bus, or another obstacle. Lifting the
opponent counts as an action (using the lifting skill), as does slamming
or throwing the target (which uses the throwing skill). The character must
be strong enough to pick his opponent up to use this maneuver.
Once slammed into an object, the target takes the damage score of
the object (usually determined by its Toughness, but the gamemaster
may adjust this) plus the attacker’s Strength Damage. The object being
slammed into takes the Strength Damage of the opponent.

Arm Pin: The hero grabs his target’s arm and forces it around
behind her, pinning it there. After the ﬁrst round, the player has
three choices as to what his character can do. Each option counts as
a separate action.
Option 1. The character does his Strength Damage only for each
round he has the arm pinned.
Option 2. The character tries to break the opponent’s arm. The
attacker must make a successful Physique or lifting roll versus a breaking diﬃculty.
If the opponent does not resist, the diﬃculty equals two times
the target’s Physique or lifting die code plus the pips plus any relevant
protection. Failing to beat the breaking diﬃculty in this case means
the target takes damage as in option 1.
If the target chooses to resist, she may make no other action in the
round, but she may move her turn up. Instead, the player rolls her
character’s Physique or lifting and adds 5 and any relevant protection to
the total to generate the breaking diﬃculty. Failure by the attacker to
beat the breaking diﬃculty in this case means that the target wrenches
free and may freely take action on the next round.
Option 3. The character may attempt to force the target to the
ground while maintaining his hold on the arm. The attacker rolls his
brawling against a submission diﬃculty.
If the opponent does not resist, the submission diﬃculty equals two
times her Reﬂexes die code plus the pips. Failing to beat the breaking
diﬃculty in this case means the target takes damage as in option 1.
If the target chooses to resist, the opponent may make no other
action in the round, though she may move her turn up. Instead, the
player rolls her character’s Reﬂexes and adds 5 and any relevant modiﬁers
to the total to generate the submission diﬃculty. Failure by the attacker
to beat the diﬃculty in this case means that the target wrenches free
and may freely take action on the next round.

Options for Various Combat Skills
Breaking Things
Use the demolitions skill guidelines in the “Example Skill Diﬃculties”
chapter for determining the eﬀect of damage on items.

Called Shot
The character chooses a speciﬁc target, like a gun in a thug’s hand,
and aims for that. This is represented by a called-shot modiﬁer, which
is added to the combat diﬃculty. On a successful attack, he knocks the
item out of the target’s hand, grabs the limb, pins the target to a wall,
or does +1D (or more, at the gamemaster’s discretion) to the damage.
The exact result depends on the situation and the player’s intent.

Disarm
If the disarm attempt is successful and the target character has
not made an action yet, she may move up her action to try and keep
a grip on the item she’s holding. The defending character makes
a Physique or lifting roll against the amount of damage done. If the
defender’s roll is greater than the damage, the target character retains
the item. If it is less than or equal to the damage, she drops it.

Combat Options

Entangle
A hero throws an entangling weapon at her opponent. On a successful marksmanship, missile weapons, or throwing roll (as appropriate), the
end of the weapon wraps itself around the target. Unless the weapon is
spiked, electriﬁed, or enhanced in some other way, it does no damage,
but it prevents the target from doing any action except for trying to
break free. The target may escape by snapping the bonds or slipping
free, each of which counts as an action. To break the weapon, he must
make a Physique or lifting roll that meets or beats the damage total of
the weapon. To slip free, he needs to roll a Reﬂexes total equal to or
higher than the weapon’s damage total.

Escape
To break free from any hold, the character must make a successful
opposed Physique or lifting roll versus the holder’s Physique or lifting.
This counts as an action.

Group Attack
This is a coordinated action. See the description of the command
skill in the next chapter for details.

Hit Locations
Hit locations are a special kind of called shot that allows a character
to shoot or strike a speciﬁc point on his target’s body. The table is used
to determine the modiﬁers for hitting a target of Human proportions
in diﬀerent areas of his body. Note that aiming at an arm or leg actually
causes less damage — this is because the character took extra care to
shoot an area that is “less vital.”

Knockout
This option does only half of the normal damage, but it can render
the target immediately unconscious with a successful attack. It requires
a successful called shot to the head. If, after the resistance total has
been subtracted, the target sustains at least two Wound levels or 50%
of his maximum Body Points in damage, then he falls unconscious for
a number of hours equal to diﬀerence between the combat skill total
and the combat diﬃculty or until he’s awoken by some external force,
whichever comes ﬁrst. The target receives only half the Wound levels
or Body Point damage inﬂicted (round down).

Multiple Weapons
Weapons that characters can use with one hand and in either hand,
such as knives or most guns, may be employed at the same time in the
same round. The character incurs a multi-action penalty.

Prone and Crouching
Attacking a target that is crouched on the ground adds 1D (3) to
the combat diﬃculty. If the target is moving while crouching, then the
combat diﬃculty increases by 2D (6), but the defending character’s
normal Move, free Move, or running result is halved.
For prone targets, subtract 2D (6) from the combat diﬃculty when
attacking at Point Blank or Short range, but add 2D (6) to combat
diﬃculty when attacking at Medium or Long range.

Characters who willingly get low to the ground or make themselves
small may get into and out of the position as a free action. However,
character forced into that position, such as a result of being thrown,
need to make an eﬀort to stand, which counts as an action.

Quick Draw
This option allows the character to act rapidly or draw and ﬁre a
weapon in the same round as one action. The character may use any
combat skill or appropriate specialization. If she is also using a weapon,
it must be suitable for quick drawing (a bow and arrow, a loaded pistol,
a dagger, a shuriken).
Before initiative is rolled, the player must announce that she intends
for her character to draw her weapon quickly. The player may then
take some of the skill dice and add them to the Perception die code for
purposes of increasing initiative for that round only. The player must
leave at least 1D in her skill. If the character wants to make multiple
attacks, she subtracts 1D for each attack beyond the ﬁrst from the

Chapter 9

•

Page 70

number of dice in the skill she’s using before
the player moves dice around. She does not
take a penalty for the draw.
All attacks by the hero in the same round
must be made with the same skill, though the
results are determined diﬀerently and they all
occur at the same die code because the multiaction penalty was already ﬁgured in.
Example: A crime ﬁghter wants to smack
her arch-nemesis with her shuriken before the
villain can draw his weapon. The crime ﬁghter
has 4D in Perception and 8D in throwing. She
may take up to 7D and add it to her Perception
die code to determine initiative. The crime
ﬁghter, however, wants to throw two shuriken.
After subtracting 1D for the extra attack, she
now has 7D in the skill, which allows her to add
up to 6D to the initiative roll. She decides to
move only 3D. This gives her 7D in Perception
to determine initiative and 4D in throwing.
Now both the hero and the villain make their
initiative rolls.

Once initiative is determined, at the character’s turn in the round,
she uses the remaining dice in the skill to determine her accuracy.

Ready a Weapon
It takes one action per item to draw a gun, unsheathe a knife, reload
a riﬂe, or something similar. Although this generally does not require
a skill roll, the gamemaster may require one related to the weapon in
question for particularly stressful situations. Additionally, drawing and
using the weapon in the same round incurs a multi-action penalty. The
gamemaster may add further modiﬁers for attempting to get out an
item from a restrictive location or ready an unwieldy weapon.

Scale
Occasionally, objects of vastly diﬀerent sizes get involved in ﬁghts.
The scale modiﬁer accounts for the fact that bigger items are easier
to hit, and usually can take more damage, than smaller ones. Use the
accompanying chart as a guide for determining the appropriate value
for the two combat participants. Gamemasters may further subdivide
between levels.
If both opponents are either larger than or equal to a Human or
smaller than or equal to a Human, subtract the larger number from

the smaller one to calculate the scale modiﬁer.
If one opponent is smaller than a Human while
the other is larger, then add together the two
values.
For most cases, use these rules: If the attacker
is larger than the defender, then the scale modiﬁer is added to the combat diﬃculty and the
damage total. If the attacker is smaller than the
defender, then the scale modiﬁer is added to the
attacker’s combat skill total and the defender’s
damage resistance total.
Example: A thief has snuck into a laboratory
defended by toy tanks with working weapons.
The tanks have a scale value of 6. With the thief ’s
scale value of the zero, the scale modiﬁer is 6
(6 - 0). Because the tank is smaller than the
thief, the tank gets a +6 to its marksmanship
roll, while the thief gets a +6 to his damage
resistance total. When the thief attacks the
tank, the scale modiﬁer is added to the thief ’s
combat diﬃculty and to his damage total, if
he manages to step on it.

In some cases, the object may be large but lightly constructed (such
as a parade balloon). At these times, the gamemaster should not add
the scale modiﬁer to the damage resistance total.
Typically, a weapon’s scale when determining how much damage it
does is the same as the person holding it or the thing it’s mounted on.
So, a riﬂe has a scale value of 0, while a full-size tank’s gun has a scale
of 10. These would diﬀer if someone targeted just the weapon.

Surprise
A hero who surprises her opponent may either act ﬁrst in the round
(if initiative hasn’t already been determined) or gain a +1D or more to
her action. Attacks from behind, an ambush, or unexpected sources (such
as a companion) make up the most common sources of surprise.

Unwieldy Weapon
Melee weapons longer than 60 centimeters, objects that are hard
to throw or grasp, ones relying on technology with which the user is
unfamiliar, or any weapons otherwise diﬃcult to wield may incur a +5
or more modiﬁer to the combat diﬃculty. The gamemaster may decide
that such factors as experience, strength, and features of the weapon
(such as a well-balanced sword) lower this modiﬁer.

CHAPTER TEN

Example Skill
Difﬁculties
What’s in this Chapter
The “Character Basics” chapter provided brief descriptions of each
skill (and you will need to return to that chapter for a refresher). When
the generic diﬃculties aren’t enough, look up various skills in this
chapter to get even more ideas on the challenge level for using those
skills in common situations. Of course, not every possibility has been
covered, but this provides a terriﬁc foundation.

Using the Example Difﬁculties
and Modiﬁers
Unless otherwise stated, all listed modiﬁers are to the diﬃculty.
Modiﬁers may be cumulative, depending on the situation — the tenser
they are, the more important the minutia become. The associated
attributed is listed after the skill name.

Extranormal Skills
Descriptions and diﬃculties for Extranormal skills are found in
their own chapters.

Knowledge-Based Skills
Skills covered: business, scholar, tech
The Knowledge attribute assists characters in ﬁnding out how much
they know about a certain ﬁeld, modiﬁed depending on the situation.
For this reason, one chart of general diﬃculties can serve most uses of
Knowledge, business, and scholar, some uses of tech, and investigation
attempts involving researching a topic.
Gamemasters can employ the “Information Diﬃculties” chart in one
of two ways: by picking a diﬃculty based on what the character seeks or
wants to recall, or by comparing the skill total rolled to the diﬃculties
(whichever level the character meets or beats is the amount and type of
information collected or recollected). Realize that the less well-deﬁned
the skill is, the less information the character knows or ﬁnds.
One high roll in any of these skills does not necessarily make the
character an expert in that ﬁeld. The roll represents only what the
character recalls at the time. A high roll could reveal a speciﬁc detail
of the information sought, as well as some hints for discovering more
of what the character seeks.

Perception-Based Skills
Skills covered: search, tracking
Gamemasters can rely on the “Observation Diﬃculties” chart on
the next page for situations involving the gathering of information.
They can be used as diﬃculties to beat or as a means of reading the
results of a dice toss.
To see if a character notices details of a scene or situation, the gamemaster may have the player make a Perception roll. Unless the characters
are actively eavesdropping, searching, tracking, or performing a similar
activity (and thus using the search or tracking skills), this passive observance of a scene does not count as an action. Use this chart as a guideline
for how much the character notices. If the skill total meets or beats the
diﬃculty, the character gains that much information.

Presence-Based Skills

Interrogation Modiﬁers —

Skills covered: charm, con, intimidation, persuasion
Characters use one of several Presence-based skills to inﬂuence other
people that they meet. The typical diﬃculty is 10, modiﬁed based on
the dispositions of the characters involved, but a gamemaster may base
it on a skill roll. See the “Mental Defenses” sidebar for more information
on this; suggested diﬃculty modiﬁers are listed below.
Die rolls alone should not determine interactions between players’
and gamemaster’s characters. Gamemasters should have their players
detail what their characters say and do to before rolling the dice. The
better the player acts the role of his character, the greater his chance of
success should be, which gamemasters can reﬂect by allowing up to a
+1D modiﬁer to the skill roll.
See also the individual entries in this chapter for charm, con (listed
with charm), intimidation (also listed with charm), and persuasion.

Mental Defenses —

In general, the resistance diﬃculty
for any Psionics or
interaction skill equals 10. The targe
t cannot actively resist
unless he knows that a psychic or inter
action skill is being
used on him by another character. If the
gamemaster decides
that the target suspects but does not
know for certain that
someone is attempting to inﬂuence him
, the gamemaster may
allow the character to take an action
earlier than his turn in
the round and roll his willpower or Prese
nce to generate a new
resistance diﬃculty. Should the character
decide to actively
defend against mental intrusion or pers
onal interaction, he
may devote all of his actions for the roun
d to that task and roll
his willpower or Presence, adding +10
to the score to get the
new resistance diﬃculty. However the
interaction resistance
diﬃculty is determined, gamemaster may
further modify the
number as the situation warrants (suc
h as stress, surprise, or
character relationship).

Interrogation Attempts
Characters may use intimidation or persuasion to get information
out of someone. Use the rules for mental defenses to determine the
diﬃculty and base interaction modiﬁers. Further modify the number by
how important the information is to the target. (See the accompanying
chart for suggestions.) A separate intimidation roll to scare the target
can complement an interrogation session.

Combat Skills
Skills covered: brawling, dodge, marksmanship, melee combat, missile
weapons, throwing
Diﬃculties for these skills are included in the “Combat” chapter.
For throwing, see also that skill’s entry in this chapter.

Business, Scholar (Knowledge)
See the “Knowledge-Based Skills” for diﬃculties and modiﬁers
related to using this skill.

Charm, Con, Intimidation
(Presence)
Charm, con, and intimidation can enhance a character’s attacks and
defenses. The player adds one-half of the diﬀerence (positive or negative)
between the diﬃculty and the charm, con, or intimidation roll to any
one attack or defense attempt (not both) made at Point Blank or Short
range. The character must use the beneﬁt from scaring (intimidation),

tricking (con), or seducing (charm) the target on the same turn as or
on the round after the interaction endeavor.
The user’s appearance and demeanor can also aﬀect charm, con, or
intimidation attempts. The more threatening the character looks or seems,
the less eﬀective charm and con actions are, while intimidation attempts are
more eﬀective. Use the “Generic Modiﬁers” table in the “Game Basics”
chapter to decide how much the appearance and demeanor aﬀect the
target, if a Disadvantage or Special Ability doesn’t already provide one.
See also “Presence-Based Skills” for other diﬃculties and modiﬁers
for these skills.

Flying (Reﬂexes),
Running, Swimming (Physique)
Diﬃculties for these skills are included in the “Movement”
chapter.

Hide (Perception), Sneak (Reﬂexes)
The diﬃculty for a hide or sneak attempt is usually the opponent’s
Perception, search (for hide), or tracking (for sneak), either as a die roll
(if the opponent is actively trying to ﬁnd the object or person) or as a
derived value equal to the number in front of the “D” in the opponent’s

Acrobatics (Reﬂexes)
Using acrobatics can also improve many of a character’s climbing,
jumping, and running attempts. The gamemaster determines the difﬁculty of the acrobatics stunt. One-half of the diﬀerence (rounded up)
between the diﬃculty and the acrobatics roll is added to the complementary skill. The acrobatics attempt and the climbing, jumping, or
running try must be done on the same turn.
Instead of adding a modiﬁer to the running or swimming diﬃculty for
particularly challenging obstacle courses, the gamemaster may have the
hero make an acrobatics roll in addition to a running or swimming roll.
Acrobatics can make a character appear more intimidating. The
player may add one-half of the diﬀerence (rounded up) between the
diﬃculty and the successful acrobatics roll to her intimidation attempt.
The intimidating attempt may be made on the same turn as the acrobatics roll or on the next round.
During a fall, acrobatics may be used to reduce bodily harm. If the
character has not already used his turn for the round, he may rely on
acrobatics in an attempt to land properly. The character generates an

acrobatics total. For every ﬁve points over the base diﬃculty number
of 10, the hero reduces the damage total by one point, in addition to
a base reduction of one point. The damage total, however, cannot be
lower than zero.

Animal Handling (Presence)
When attempting to get an animal to do a trick, the character must
also roll against its willpower roll (the gamemaster generates this).
Examples of tricks include rolling over, getting into a cage, jumping up,
and obeying commands. The character’s animal handling total may be
modiﬁed by the attitude of the animal toward the character. The success
of tricks are determined by a roll of the animal’s attributes or skills.

Command (Presence)
The command skill governs the act of convincing individuals to
comply with speciﬁc directions, as well as maintaining morale during
group undertakings (such as combat or building large pieces of equipment). This skill is typically used only with the gamemaster’s characters,
though it can be sometimes attempted with the players’ characters
(such situations should be roleplayed ﬁrst, with a bonus or penalty
to the command roll based on how well the group participated in the
activity together). A high command roll can complement individual
participants’ rolls in a group activity, while a low command roll can
impose negative modiﬁers. It generally requires at least one round of
planning to perform eﬀectively.
Characters can use this skill to combine their attacks. One person is
designated the leader and makes the command roll. If successful, everyone

Contortion (Reﬂexes)
The chart below contains sample diﬃculty numbers for escaping
from various kinds of restraints. Modify the diﬃculty based on the
circumstances of the escape, such as the conditions the character
works under or specially designed restraints. The character may not use
this skill if completely immobilized. If in multiple
restraints, the character must make a separate roll
for each one. A Critical Failure indicates that the
character has pulled a muscle (and he does his
Strength Damage to himself ). The gamemaster
decides whether he may try again.
Note that this skill does not substitute
for the lockpicking skill. The character may
be able to pull his arms over his head to
use his hands, but he may not be able to
slip out of the handcuﬀs unless they are
improperly secured.

Demolitions (Knowledge)
The base diﬃculty is 5. For extra damage and special eﬀects, the
character must spend one round per diﬃculty number setting up the
explosives. The character also needs to indicate how much explosive
she’s using. If the attempt is successful, compare the skill total with
the object’s damage resistance total (its Toughness modiﬁed by size,
thickness, ﬂaws, supports, etc.). Items that take at least 13 points above
their damage resistance total are severely damaged, if not destroyed.
Items taking less than that are weakened, and another attempt may be
made (with the object having a reduced damage resistance total and
possibly other problems).

Page 75

Remember that, while a character may think an object is constructed
of one type of material, it may not be. Though this does not alter the
diﬃculty of setting the explosive, it may change the results of special
eﬀects. For instance, an explosive set for thin wood won’t do much
good if that’s only veneer for reinforced steel.

Rigging a bomb so a car explodes

Disguise (Presence)
A character’s skill total in creating the disguise
serves two related purposes. First, the higher the roll,
the less likely an observer will be to question the disguise. Second, the total becomes the diﬃculty number
for Perception or investigation eﬀorts to see through it.
If the investigation check is higher than the disguise total,
the disguise has been penetrated.
If at any time while the character is disguised she performs
an action inconsistent with the disguise, any observer has a
chance to see through it.
Although one character may use disguise on another character, the disguised character must actively work at keeping up
the disguise using her own disguise skill or Presence.

Gambling (Perception)
Gambling doesn’t aﬀect games that are purely random, but does
inﬂuence games with an element of strategy, like poker. All characters
make opposed gambling rolls, without spending Character or Fate
Points, and the highest roll wins. A character may cheat by using
Character or Fate Points on the roll, and the gamemaster may give
bonuses to rolls for people looking for a cheater or helping the cheater.
The gamemaster should consider as many “angles” as possible when
using the gambling skill, and add these as modiﬁers to one or more
participants’ rolls.

Know-how (Perception)
To use this skill to help with an activity covered by another skill
(which the character does not have), the character spends the round
before examining the situation, performing no other actions, and
making a roll of this skill versus the diﬃculty set for the action. The
character gets neither the unskilled modiﬁer nor the preparing modiﬁer. Within the next 30 seconds (six rounds), the character may add
the diﬀerence between the diﬃculty and the know-how skill roll to
total roll for the attribute dictated by the actual skill required. The
character may not use this skill in place of a skill she already has. The
gamemaster may limit the number of times per hour this skill may be
used on the same action.

Lifting (Physique)
At the gamemaster’s discretion, a player may make a lifting check
when his character ﬁrst picks up an object. (Generally, if the object’s
weight would give it a diﬃculty equal to or greater than one-half of
the character’s lifting, rounded up, or the object is being lifted hastily
or under stress, the gamemaster should require a lifting roll.)
For each round the object is carried, the character makes another
check to see if he can continue to carry the object. If the player fails the
roll, his character is too exhausted and must put the object down. If the
character is doing anything else at the time (other than walking slowly
or talking), continuing to carry the object counts as a multiple action.

Persuasion (Presence)
Characters can use persuasion to “pay” another person to behave
dishonorably, such as through ignoring duty, looking the other way,
or divulging secret information. Success depends greatly on the target.

accept bribes. Use the diﬃculties listed under “Presence-Based Skills”

Repair (Perception)
The base diﬃculty to ﬁx or modify any piece of equipment or
vehicle is 10. The amount of damage sustained, the character’s familiarity with the item, availability of parts, and complexity of the task
can modify the diﬃculty. The gamemaster may require a separate tech
roll to determine whether the character can ﬁgure out how to repair
an unknown item. Destroyed parts must be replaced, which raises
the diﬃculty. Additionally, if the character rushes the job, not only
is there an increased chance of failure, but the item could also break
again soon after its next use.

When a character ﬁrst mounts a ridable animal, she must make a
riding roll against the creature’s willpower roll (the gamemaster generates this). The character’s animal handling total may be modiﬁed by
the attitude of the animal toward the character. The character stays in
control if she ties or beats the beast’s roll. If she fails, consult the table
below for what occurs.
When attempting to get the beast to perform a special maneuver
or during events that might frighten it, the character must also roll
against the animal’s Presence or willpower. Examples of special maneuvers include jumping a fence, crossing a raging river, moving faster, or
slowing down quickly. (The success of special maneuvers are determined
with the animal’s attributes or skills.)
Characters attacking from the back of a beast take a multi-action
penalty for having to both control the mount and use their weapon.

Search (Perception)
When used to eavesdrop on or secretly watch an event or another
character, the skill total indicates the amount of information gained
from the surveillance. Use the “Observation Diﬃculties” table. A
Critical Failure could mean anything from no information obtained to
being immediately spotted by the character being observed, depending
on the situation.
When searching for a hidden object or person, the diﬃculty is
generally the hide roll used to conceal the target. Otherwise, the base

Stamina (Physique)
Gamemasters may allow a character to make a multi-action stamina
roll to complement a strenuous activity, such as lifting or running. The
diﬃculty equals 5 times the current fatigue modiﬁer. The character
may add one-half (rounded up) of the diﬀerence between the successful stamina roll and the diﬃculty. The strenuous activity still receives
the fatigue modiﬁer.
Whenever a character fails a stamina roll, she is fatigued; all actions
are at -1D for every stamina check failed until the character rests for
as long as she exerted herself.
Characters can still continue if they are fatigued, until they fail a
third stamina check. At this point, the character is completely exhausted
and must rest for twice the amount of time that she exerted herself to
remove the penalty.
To avoid the eﬀects of a toxin (inhaled, ingested, or absorbed) or
disease (encountered in any manner), a character makes a stamina roll.
(The ﬁrst attempt after initial exposure does not count as an action;
subsequent attempts to resist the toxin do.) Several factors ﬁgure into
the diﬃculty of the attempt, including the deadliness and dosage of
the poison in question. For example, a fatal bout of botulism has a
diﬃculty of 9, while a killing dose of cyanide has a diﬃculty of 42.
Gamemasters might call for stamina rolls against falling asleep
or unconscious. (This counts as an action.) Resisting sleep is a difﬁculty of 5 per hour beyond the normal awake time, modiﬁed by
environmental factor (too warm or too cold, noise level, etc.). For
unconsciousness caused by wounds, see the “Wound Levels” table in
the “Damage” chapter.

Streetwise (Perception)
Streetwise helps characters get around urban environments. Some
situations call for seeking out those living outside the local law, while
others can be handled through upstanding citizens. Generally, the
modiﬁers are the same for each situation, but the gamemaster should
adjust them depending on the circumstances. It is possible, though
generally unlikely, that a character would be well-liked by both upstanding residents and local criminals.
Example: In a village, a character would ﬁnd it easier to gather
information about a particular person (and thus the city-size modiﬁer
would be -15 instead of +15), but he might have a harder time getting someone to trust him enough to tell him about it (making the
tolerance modiﬁer +15).

Throwing (Coordination)
In addition to being useful for tossing items, the throwing skill
enhances a character’s ability to grab projectiles out of the air. The difﬁculty of catching an object is typically the thrower’s throwing or missile

takes care to throw well, reduce the thrower’s skill total by 9.
Combat diﬃculties for this skill are included in the “Combat”

target. A shadowed character can attempt to spot the shadow with a
search roll versus the shadowing character’s tracking roll. Gamemasters
may opt to include relevant hide modiﬁers to the tracking roll, if the
shadow is being cautious.

Willpower (Presence)
Willpower is generally used to resist interaction attempts and mentally damaging attacks. See the “Mental Defense” sidebar earlier in this
chapter for details. Characters with this skill may generally use it instead
of stamina to resist fatigue, sleep, and unconsciousness, though there
may be some situations the gamemaster restricts its substitution. See
the stamina entry in this chapter for information on diﬃculties.
Gamemaster can also use willpower (or Presence) to determine the
reactions of players’ and gamemaster’s characters to each other and to
their surroundings. The more the gamemaster believes that the character should be at ease or frightened, the greater the diﬃculty. Use the
descriptions of standard diﬃculties to determine the level. This passive
application of willpower is not an action.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

Magic
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter covers the ability to manipulate the paranormal forces
of the universe for extraordinary eﬀects. The Magic skills are available
only to characters with the Magic Extranormal attribute.
Although this chapter discusses guidelines for creating magical
spells, gamemasters may still include unexplainable magic. Since
unexplainable magic doesn’t have to be explained — it just is — its
use is out of the players’ characters’ control. Only the gamemaster
knows how it works.

Obtaining Access to Magic
There are only two ways for players’ characters to get magical abilities. The ﬁrst is to put dice in the Magic attribute and skills at character
creation, which costs the same as obtaining other attributes.
The second is to obtain the gamemaster’s permission after play has
begun. If the player can come up with a reason for the character to
learn or gain magic abilities (such as they were latent or were a gift
from a supernatural being) and the gamemaster agrees, then the player
may purchase them for the character. The cost to get the initial 1D in
Magic is 20 Character Points. After that, it is 10 times the number in
front of the “D” to improve this attribute by one pip. The player must
still purchase Magic skill pips separately, though a player may buy one
pip in one Magic skill for the character at the same time as he initially
gets the attribute after character creation.
Gamemasters are discouraged from allowing characters to have multiple Extranormal abilities, but it is possible, especially if the character
has several Disadvantages that show up frequently in each session.

Learning and Improving Magic
Skills
Magic skills may be learned between adventures, like regular skills.
The cost for a Magic skill, in Character Points, equals twice the normal
cost for gaining or improving a normal skill. This cost is doubled again
if a teacher — simply another magic user with the skill at a higher level
— is not available to instruct the character. A character may learn or
improve one Magic skill after each adventure.

Magic Skills
All spells require one of these skills in order to cast them. When
casting a spell, the character generates a Magic skill total and tries to
beat the spell’s diﬃculty. If the skill total equals or exceeds the diﬃculty,
then the spell works (to a greater or lesser extent).

Alteration
Alteration governs magic involving change. Change means taking
something that exists and modifying it or mutating it into something
else. A magic spell used to increase a character’s Physique attribute
would be an alteration spell, as would one that converts a simple ﬂame
into an exploding ﬁreball. Alteration could enhance, reduce, or restrict
a character’s existing skills.
Alteration must work with things that are already there. An alteration
spell can only modify existing characteristics. It could be used to change
a person into a bat, but it would not give the person the ability to ﬂy;
conjuration would also be necessary to give the character the Flight
Special Ability, something he didn’t have before.

Apportation
Apportation governs magic involving movement. For example, a
telekinesis spell, by which a character could “grab” an object and move
it using magic, would be an apportation spell. Calling a dagger from a
box at home to your hand is apportation, as is teleporting yourself to
another place. Apportation can also cause a person or creature to move
from one place to another under its own power. Spells that restrict
movement would also be apportation spells.
Apportation is not conjuration — the object or the creature summoned is in existence at the time the spell is cast, the apportation spell
simply “calls” the object or creature.
Characters or creatures may either be apported by compulsion (and
come under their own power), moved by the spell’s power, or teleported.
When the apportation spell uses compulsion, the skill total is compared
to the target’s willpower or Presence in much the same way a persuasion
attempt would be used — the target’s attitude toward being apported must
be assessed, and the spell works as if it were “persuading” the target.

Page 84

For apportation spells with the speed less than the range, the target is
moved by the spell’s power. The spell lifts up the target and brings her to
the caster. For apportation spells with the speed equal to the range, the
target is teleported. In either case, the apportation skill total has to overcome the target’s weight value. (Look up the target’s mass on the “Spell
Measures” table.) The target can resist by rolling her Physique or lifting
and adding it to her weight value (theoretically, she tries to make herself
harder for the spell to grasp). (Resisting does not count as an action for
the target character.) If the apportation total is equal to or higher than the
weight value, the character is teleported. This goes for self-teleportation
as well (though the character is not likely to resist).

Conjuration
Conjuration magic involves producing something from nothing. A
spell that produces gold out of thin air is conjuration, as is one that
imbues an inanimate object with animate features (such as creating a
stone man and giving it the attributes of a person). Conjured items and
characteristics remain in existence for the duration of the spell.
Conjuration is used for only one purpose: creation of something out
of nothing. For example, if you wanted to animate a plant and give
it the power of speech, you would use conjuration — you would have
to “create” in it the ability to talk and the Knowledge and Perception
necessary to speak. Conjuration is not used to bring things from one
place to another — that is apportation.

Divination
Divination governs magic involving obtaining knowledge. For
example, scrying spells, “far-sight” spells, and “speak with the dead”
types of spells are all covered by divination. Spells that block the obtaining of knowledge are also divination spells.

Characteristics of a Spell
There are eight characteristics of a spell, and the precalculated spells
are formatted using theses categories of information.
Skill Used: The skill selected is the one necessary to cast the spell.
A diﬀerent one might be necessary to target or use the spell.
Diﬃculty: The diﬃculty is the skill total a character must generate
to get a spell to work.
Eﬀect: The eﬀect describes the primary features of the spell (amount
of damage, amount of protection, distance moved, etc.), plus the value
of the eﬀect.
Duration: Duration speciﬁes how long a spell’s eﬀect will last. The
duration is given in both “real” time (minutes, seconds, hours, etc.)
and in a time value (as read on the “Spell Measures” table).
Range: The maximum distance the eﬀect travels from the magic
user’s casting location is called the range. (If the magic user moves, the
starting point of the range does not go with her.) In most cases, the
character using the spell can only use it at this range or less. Often, the
caster can choose the exact range when the eﬀect is used. Sometimes,
the character must use the spell at this range exactly. Ranges are given in
meters and in distance values (as read on the “Spell Measures” table).
Speed: The speed indicates how quickly the spell travels from the
caster to the target.

of the spell, regardless of

Casting Time: This aspect indicates how long the character must
spend creating the spell’s eﬀect. During the period of casting time,
the character may be performing related actions (like concentrating,
performing rituals, arranging components, etc.), but no other skills
can be used during the casting time.
Other Aspects: Other aspects of the spell encompass modiﬁers,
including components and expanded eﬀects, that inﬂuence the spell’s
eﬀect and adjust its diﬃculty.
Description: The description tells what skill is needed to create the
spell, what the spell does, what any success levels mean, and so on.
The description may be very short, or it may include tables and precise
explanations of eﬀects.

Using Spells and Their Effects
Roll the spell skill for the spell in question to get a skill total. If the
total is higher than the diﬃculty number, the spell has succeeded and
the caster may use the spell’s eﬀect.
Which skill the spell requires is either decided when the eﬀect is
developed or listed with a precalculated spell.
Remember that players may spend Character and Fate Points to
make sure they have suﬃciently high skill totals to cast the spell.

Targeting or Using the Spell
Many spells require separate targeting or manipulative skill totals
when they are used. The most common of these are combat eﬀects
that act like weapons.
If the spell focuses on a target (such as a lightning bolt or telekinesis spell), the player and gamemaster must decide what skill (such
as marksmanship, melee weapons, or throwing) to use to hit, if it’s not
already built into the spell or described with it, as well as the appropriate defense, if any. (Gamemasters who prefer to keep activation skills
within the arcane arts could allow a separate apportation roll as the
targeting skill.) Attack spells, for example, would use standard combat
diﬃculties and modiﬁers for their defense (regardless of the targeting
skill). Common sense should be used to determine which skill and
defense to use.

Magic • Page 85
Example: With a ﬁreball spell, the gamemaster decides that the caster
has to generate a marksmanship skill total to hit his target. Even though
the ﬁreball will go where he wants it to, there still has to be some way
to determine whether or not anybody is hit by it.

of the result points as the bonus to the appropriate value and reﬁgure
the value’s measure or die code, if necessary. (Round fractions up.)

This keeps eﬀects from being automatic “killers.” Granted, most
spells won’t need this — a spell that a character uses to take over a
target’s mind needs no “to hit” total; it is instead the eﬀect versus the
target’s willpower or Presence.
Casting a spell at the same time as using its targeting or activation
skill is not considered a multi-action. However, if the character wishes
to cast an attack spell, which requires a targeting skill roll, and ﬁre a gun
in the same round, then the multi-action modiﬁer of -1D (for taking
two actions in the same round) is applied to the casting roll, the spell
targeting roll, and the weapon targeting roll.
In general, any spell that works like a weapon requires this kind of
control, and a few others might. Gamemasters in doubt may wish to
assign a targeting skill check in addition to the spell skill diﬃculty.

Every once in a while, the gamemaster will come up with a spell
or magical item that is either too powerful for game balance, or she
doesn’t want to explain how it works for some reason. In that case, the
gamemaster should use the “artifacts and legends” rule.
The gamemaster can simply assign values and diﬃculties to a spell
and state that the spell’s eﬀect is “legendary” or part of an “artifact.” It
only works the way it does because the gamemaster says it does. She can
assign any side eﬀects, rules, or whatever to the special artifact because
it is a truly special case.

Backlash Option
At the gamemaster’s option, characters who roll a Critical Failure
with an abysmally small skill total becoming disoriented and lose all
of their actions in the next round.

Applying the Effect
The eﬀect is applied diﬀerently depending on its purpose.
Skill Simulations: Some spells provide the character with skills or
bonuses to skills or attributes. For example, a “healing” spell might
give a character a certain number of dice in medicine, and the result of
using the spell’s skill gift would be compared to the normal diﬃculty
for using medicine on a target. Any attribute bonuses aﬀect the skills
and specializations under them, and any skill bonuses add to the specializations under them (if the character has any).
Damage and Protection: The damage from any spell that causes
injury is magical in nature, of course, while protective spells can defend
against it. Thus, creatures and beings that are not normally aﬀected by
standard weapons can be harmed. Of course, unless the spell includes
the appropriate option, nonmagical armor can protect against magically produced damage.
General Eﬀects: When the spell oﬀers a “general” eﬀect, and thus
has no targeting or manipulative skill associated with it, the gamemaster
will have to make up levels of success for that spell. A minimal success,
with the roll equal to the diﬃculty, means that the spell was slightly
oﬀ or less than perfect. A solid success of one to ﬁve points over the
diﬃculty usually gets the spell to do exactly what the caster wants the
spell to do. A superior success of six points over the diﬃculty reveals
that the spell worked better than usual; at this level, the gamemaster
might even provide a bonus to its use.

Result Points
Unless the spell description mentions otherwise, the result points (the
diﬀerence between the spell casting roll and the spell diﬃculty) applies
to one basic aspect of the spell. The magic user must decide which one
— eﬀect, range, or duration — before casting the spell. Add one-half

Artifacts and Legends

Precalculated Spells
The next chapter oﬀers several common spells. You can use them
right away or as inspiration for inventing your own.

Building the Spell
As you create each spell, you will keep track of a Spell Total and a
Negative Spell Total Modiﬁer. Certain elements, like the value and
the range of the eﬀect, cause the Spell Total to go up (that is, make the
eﬀect harder to cast), while other elements, like a longer casting time,
add to the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁer and (in the end) make the
Spell Total go down (that is, make the eﬀect easier to cast).
Note that Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers are designated within the
spell design system as negative numbers to distinguish them from those
modiﬁers added to the Spell Total. However, they add to the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁers total, which is subtracted from the Spell Total at
the end of the design.
You will need a paper and pencil and an active imagination for this
part, so get ready. You can ﬁnd a blank Spell Design Sheet, including a
worksheet to help you with the calculations, at the end of this chapter.
A calculator might also help.

Determining the Desired Effect
At this point, write out what you want the spell to do — basically.
What sort of eﬀect are you trying to create? What range will you need?
Will it need charges? How long will the eﬀect last? Consider all things

Adjusting and Readjusting —

As you design a spell, you can always
adjust any aspects
you include, so that you can get the Spel
l Total (and the spell
diﬃculty) that you want. So, if you deci
de to add charges to
your wand of power after you’ve created
the initial design but
you don’t want the higher diﬃculty, you
can go back and lower
the range, increase the casting time,
or tinker with another
aspect, until you have a Spell Total you
like.

can determine, by using the “Die Code” table, has a value of 18) is a
safe bet. To kill someone outright, 10D (which has a value of 30) is
usually necessary.
Protection spells work similarly, though, obviously, they reduce the
amount of damage taken. Checking out weapon damage die codes can
help you determine the number of dice you need for your spell.
Both protection and damage have a visible component (such as a
glowing aura) that indicates their use and, if relevant, trajectory.
Spells that increase, decrease, create, or otherwise aﬀect attributes
or skills are determined the same way. For example, a spell to take over
someone’s mind would give the caster a persuasion of +3D or more with
a value of at least 14.
Spells may not create stand-alone attributes unless they are included
in something that the spell has created (such as a creature). In this case,
use the same level as the stand-alone skill.
Some spells’ eﬀects are best reﬂected by a Special Ability or a Disadvantage. With a Special Ability, the spell eﬀect’s value equals 3 times the
Special Ability cost times the number of ranks in that Special Ability,
plus the cost of any Enhancements and their ranks, minus the cost of
any Limitations and their ranks. With a Disadvantage, the spell eﬀect’s
value equals the 3 times the cost of the Disadvantage. Spells generally
do not provide a target with Advantages or improved Funds, but the
gamemaster may allow this in special circumstances, such creating a
friendship spell using Contacts.
Spell eﬀects that don’t fall into any category should be given a difﬁculty and the circumstance in which the diﬃculty can be beat. The
diﬃculty equals the eﬀect’s value.
If the spell creates something, refer to the “Spell Measures” table to
determine the spell eﬀect’s value for the desired amount of weight. Find
the desired weight in kilograms, then read over to the corresponding
value under the “Val.” column. Most oﬀensive and defensive spells have
a weight value of zero, but the gamemaster may require exceptionally
heavy-duty spells to have a larger weight value.

Basic Aspects
Use the Spell Worksheet to keep track of the Spell Total
and all modiﬁers, aspects, and your own ideas.

Starting Spell Total and
Starting Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers
Most Spell Totals begin at zero, but gamemasters who
want magic less common and spells to be more diﬃcult to
cast should have a greater starting Spell Total. Negative Spell
Total Modiﬁers always start at zero.

Effect and Skill Used
One you decide what the spell will do — damage,
protection, skill bonus, and so on — determine its corresponding value using the “Die Code” table or “Spell
Measures” table — or both, if the spell is intended to do
more than one thing (such as create an animated golem).
Here are some guidelines.
Damage spells aﬀect character health (that is, their
Body Points or Wounds). To hurt someone, 6D (which you

The spell designer may chose to have certain characteristics of the spell
(such as a golem’s Physique and Body Points or Wounds) be determined
by the points by which the spell skill beats the spell diﬃculty. (Subtract
the spell diﬃculty from the spell skill total to determine the number
of points.) Any attributes ﬁgured this way have a die code equal to the
points above the diﬃculty (minimum of 1D). Body Points equal 10
plus the points above the diﬃculty, while Wound levels equal the points
above the diﬃculty, divided by 2 and rounded up (minimum of one
Wound level). There is no cost for Body Points or Wound levels and
the ﬁrst attribute decided with this method; each additional attribute
ups the Spell Total by one.
A spell may contain more than one eﬀect. Each eﬀect is determined
separately and added to the total. All of the eﬀects must fall under the
domain of the same skill. You should also list the skill used to cast
the spell at this time. See the “Skills and Sample Eﬀects” sidebar for
suggestions.
Once you decide on a spell eﬀect’s value, write it down. This is the
ﬁrst element of your Spell Total.

Note on Attack and Protection Spells
By default, magical and nonmagical armor can defend against
attack spells. To ignore nonmagical armor, double the value to add it.
Damage is either physical or mental. To do both, each kind must be
purchased separately.
Similarly, protection spells defend against both magical and nonmagical attacks. To be subject to one but not the other, half the value
to add it (round up). The protection may be against physical or mental
attacks. To resist both, each kind must be purchased separately.

Range
Determine how far away you want the caster to be able to aﬀect things
with the spell. Then read the measurement (in meters) on the “Spell
Measures” table to get a range value. Add the value to your Spell Total.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the mage can use the spell (or its eﬀect,
if the spell was charged into an object) to target anywhere within that

range. The caster can aim at a spot or something mobile
(such as a person or a car). If the caster hits a moving target
within the range of the eﬀect, and the target leaves the range
of the spell before it ends, the eﬀect disappears (unless you
use the focus optional aspect, described herein). Even if the
target comes back into range within the spell’s duration, the
spell has to be created again.
For purposes of determining the range modiﬁer with ranges
longer than 20 meters, consider anything from three meters
up to one-third of the range to be Short range, anything from
one-third to two-thirds to be Medium range, and anything
from two-thirds to the full range to be Long range. (Round
fractions up.) For ranges of 25 meters or less, distances from
three meters to the full range are Short range.
Example: A spell has a range of 40 meters, which translates to a Short range of 3 to 14, Medium of 14 to 27, and
Long of 27 to 40.

For apportation spells, range indicates either how far
away the target is or how far a target may be sent. If the latter, the target
must be no more than one meter from the caster.

Speed
Speed determines how fast the spell gets from the caster to the target.
First, look at the range value (above). That is the maximum distance
the eﬀect travels. If you select a speed value equal to the range value,
then the spell’s eﬀect travels from you to your target in one second,
because the speed’s unit of measure is meters per second.
You can select a lower speed value. Its corresponding measure
indicates how quickly the spell’s eﬀect moves.
To see how long it takes the eﬀect to reach a given target, subtract
the speed value from the range value to the target (not the range value
of the spell). Read the result as a value on the “Spell Measures” table.
The measurement is the number of seconds it takes for the spell’s eﬀect
to go from you to your target.
Example: A projective telepathy spell could allow one character to
send thoughts to another. The player decides the range value of the
spell is an incredible 30 (one million meters, or 1,000 kilometers). She
makes the speed value, however, only 20 (10,000 meters per second,
or 10 kilometers per second). The target is 400 kilometers away (a
value of 28). The range of 28 minus the speed of 20 gives a result of
8. Reading this on the “Spell Measures” chart reveals that it takes 40
seconds for the eﬀect to reach the target.
Sometimes, you’ll use a lower speed to keep the Spell Total lower.
However, quite often, especially with attack spells, you’ll need that
instantaneous eﬀect. If you build an attack spell with a lower speed,
you have to be aware that the spell will be less accurate — that is, the
target will be able to get out of the way much easier.
The diﬀerence between the speed value and the range value of the
target is added to the target’s dodge, Reﬂexes, or combat diﬃculty when
getting out of the way of a slow attack. So, in the previous example,
not only would it take a value of 8 (40 seconds) to reach the target, the
target would get a bonus of +8 to dodge on the round that the spell’s
eﬀect reaches the area where the caster ﬁrst believed the target to be.

Magic • Page 89
A higher speed value than the range value provides no beneﬁt.
Add the speed value onto the Spell Total and keep going.

Duration
Duration indicates how long the eﬀect lasts or continues to act
upon a target. To determine how long the duration is, ﬁnd the time
value on the “Spell Measures” table and add it to the Spell Total. List
the time measure with the spell, leaving it as seconds or converting it
to rounds, minutes, hours, or whatever.
The minimum duration for any spell is one second (or zero value).
Since the duration begins from the moment the spell is cast, the duration may have to be quite long, especially if it takes a while for the
spell to travel to its target (determined by a lower speed value than its
range value; see the pervious section).

Casting Time
The last of the mandatory elements is casting time. This is the time
the character must spend preparing the spell and performing any optional
aspects (such as rituals, concentration, and so forth). This time must be
spent every time the character casts the spell. The casting time for a spell
cannot be rushed. A magic user may perform no other actions while
casting a spell, unless the cast time is three seconds (value of 3) or less.
The minimum casting time is zero (one second). Unlike the other
mandatory elements, casting time falls under the Negative Spell Total
Modiﬁers.
Some Notes Regarding Casting Time: For a noncombat spell,
or for a spell that will be built with charges (see the charges optional
aspect), high casting times are good. The character can spend some
time during or between adventures preparing and casting the spell and
then release it using an activation.

Effects and Their Dur
ations
—
Magic is not a science based
on observations of the nat
ural
world. It is an art based on
intervening in natural law
s. Magical eﬀects create a reality tha
t temporarily supersede the
local
laws of physics. When the
magic wears oﬀ, the natura
l laws
resume. In order for there
to be a permanent eﬀect, the
altered
reality has to stick around
long enough for the natura
l laws to
take over. As it is much eas
ier to destroy something
than to
construct it, damage is ins
tantly permanent while a
con
jured
item usually disappears wh
en the spell’s duration end
s. Thus,
many spells, especially com
bat spells, mayt have the mi
nimum
duration because their eﬀe
cts are permanent.
Generally, once a natural pro
cess begins to break down
the
conjured or altered item,
then the magic can return
control
of the reality to the local
natural laws and the con
jured or
altered item will not return
to its state before being aﬀe
cted
by magic. Similarly, if it wo
uld require more work for
nature
to revert an altered item
(such as closing an opened
door or
lock), then reality conced
es the spell’s eﬀect and allo
ws it to
continue past the spell’s du
ration.

If a character attempts to cast a spell over several days or several
weeks, the physical and mental strain will take their toll on the magic
user. When performing a lengthy ritual, the caster must make a stamina
roll against a diﬃculty of 5 increased by +2 for each day the character
continues the casting time past the ﬁrst day. The gamemaster may have
the character roll each day, or once at the end. Failure of a stamina roll
means that the character could not maintain the ritual or concentration, and the casting of the spell fails.

Summary
To this point, you have created a basic spell. It has a set eﬀect, a set
duration, and a set casting time. It may be used at any range up to the
maximum and can only aﬀect one speciﬁc target (person, tree, car, spot
of ground, etc.). There are no other controls or modiﬁcations.
If you don’t wish to go any further, add the Negative Spell Total
Modiﬁers to the Spell Total and then divide the total by 2, rounding
up. This is the diﬃculty to cast the spell. See “Final Spell Total” later
in this chapter for restrictions on the Spell Total. Then decide which
Magic skill is necessary to cast the spell. Write these last few things on
the Spell Worksheet, and you’re done.
Of course, there’s so much else you can do with the spell...

Optional Aspects
The caster may not care about having any options but without
optional aspects, the spell is pretty limited.
With all optional aspects, the caster must deﬁne exactly what that
particular spell calls for.
For those optional aspects that include a special roll (such as certain
levels of gestures or incantations), the roll is made at the end of the
casting time and it does not count as a multi-action, though the roll
must be modiﬁed if the magic user is attempting some other, non-casting-related action in the round.

Area Effect
The eﬀect of the spell travels out from a target. Add the area eﬀect
modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
Adjust the eﬀect by -1 (pip, point of damage, etc.) per full meter
for characters outside of ground zero (within a half-meter of the target). Compare the targeting roll of spell against the defense total of
characters not at ground zero; those who have a defense total greater
than the targeting roll managed to dive for cover or protect themselves
from the eﬀect.
Example: A spell with a damaging eﬀect and an area eﬀect with
a four-meter radius would do the full damage to between zero and
one-half meter from the target, one point less to characters between
one-half and one meter, two points less to characters between one and
two meters, and so on.
Two-dimensional circle (a few centimeters thick): +1 per half-meter
radius.
Three-dimensional sphere (for explosions and 3D illusions): +5 per
meter radius and +1 bonus to hit one target (bonus is applied to the
same target).
One alternate shape: +1 to area eﬀect modiﬁer.

Chapter 11

•

Page 90

Several alternate shapes (speciﬁc one chosen at time of casting): +3
to area eﬀect modiﬁer.
Fluid shape (shape may change any time during spell’s duration):
+6 to area eﬀect modiﬁer.

Change Target
The caster can move the spell’s eﬀect to a new target. Add the change
target modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
Only spells with durations of 2.5 seconds or longer may include
this modiﬁer. Changing a target requires a new targeting roll and, if
done within the same round as the ﬁrst targeting roll, incurs a multiaction penalty. If the old target moves out of range before a new one
is acquired, the spell ends.
Change target: +5 per target (including ﬁrst).
Change target with multi-target (multi-target aspect purchased
separately): the change target modiﬁer applies to each multi-target
(ex., three change targets with four multi-targets is +60, or +5 x 3
changes x 4 targets).

Charges
The caster ﬁxes the spell in his mind or in an object or another
person. Add the charges modiﬁer (see below for determining it) to
the Spell Total.
The caster needs spend the time to cast the spell only once, but if
there is a targeting or activation skill or requirement, then this must be
done each time. The charge goes oﬀ in the round it was activated.
Charges: Look up the number of charges as a measure on the “Spell
Measures” table; the corresponding value is the cost of putting the charges
in. (Round fractional measures down; minimum value of 1.)
Wards: If the charge is activated by a certain set of situations (speciﬁed
at spell casting) — such a phrase, a condition, or a time limit — then
the charge costs an additional 10% (round up). Should a speciﬁc skill be
able to circumvent the ward, the reduction equals -1 for a diﬃculty of
20 and an additional -1 for each one point below the starting diﬃculty.
(So a diﬃculty of 15 gives a reduction of -6.) Only spells that have a
speed less than the range (and therefore take at least one round before
the eﬀect occurs) may include wards that skills can circumvent.
Example: A magic user decides to give his ﬁreball spell ﬁve charges. This
has a value of 4, which is the charge modiﬁer. Should the mage decide
to charge a door frame with the spell, requiring that anyone who passes
through the door sets oﬀ the spell, the charge modiﬁer becomes 5.

Community
The spell requires helpers in order for it to be created. Use the
accompanying tables to determine the amount to add to the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁers.
The number of helpers determines the basic community modiﬁer.
The “Number of Helpers” is a range of helpers the character has assisting him. The character must specify when the spell is created exactly
how many helpers are necessary (along with what they must do and
any skills associated with those actions). The tasks must be reasonable
and appropriate to the spell’s eﬀect.
The participation of the helpers is determined by what the helper
actually has to do during the casting time. Decide how much help the

helpers lend (that is, how diﬃcult their tasks are), and multiply the
community modiﬁer by the corresponding participation multiplier.
The participants must be able to perform the tasks within the casting
time.
The character creating the spell must declare what type of actions
the helpers must perform. Simple actions include readying components,
chanting mantras, passing tools, and so on.
A participation level with a diﬃculty means that the helpers actually
have to execute some sort of complex action during the casting — perform a sacriﬁce, dance (and make an acrobatics skill roll), or whatever.
Diﬀerent helpers can be doing diﬀerent things of the same diﬃculty for
this purpose. Multiple groups of helpers might be performing diﬀerent
levels of actions, for multiple community multipliers.
Example: A magic user casts a spell to summon a spirit. There
might be two communities involved. The minor apprentice members
of his guild (a group of 31) might be chanting (a simple action). This
gives a community modiﬁer of 4 (8 x 0.5), while a cadre of ﬁve senior
apprentices perform the sacriﬁce of a lamb (diﬃculty 11, for a modiﬁer of 2 times 1 for 2. These are two separate modiﬁers worth 4 and 2
respectively, or a total of 6.
When the magic user ﬁnishes the casting time of a communityaided spell, the gamemaster generates a skill total for any communities
involved (when necessary). The skill of the community should be fairly
average, unless the gamemaster has reason to think diﬀerently (the minor
apprentices, above, would probably have artist skills of around 2D+2,
while the priests might have melee combat skill of 3D or so).

Magic • Page 91
Add the diﬃculty modiﬁer to the diﬃculty to determine the chance
of having the entire group succeed (in a mass skill total). So, if the 31
minor apprentices in the above example had to generate a artist total
of 11 (because they had to chant a long string of words correctly)
using their average skill level (2D+2), the actual diﬃculty would be
22 (11 + 14). For this reason, it is best if large groups only participate
by performing simple actions.
If the group is a small one (under six), or if the community role is
being performed by players’ characters or speciﬁc gamemaster-controlled
characters, however, the skill totals can be made separately. No diﬃculty
modiﬁer should be added to the community diﬃculty when the skill
totals are ﬁgured separately. If any community group or member of a
community fails in his skill total, the entire spell does not work.
The “Community” table is based on the “Spell Measures” table, so
you can extend the modiﬁers accordingly. To get the diﬃculty modiﬁer,
multiply the “base modiﬁer” by 2 and subtract 2 from that.
Example: A spell that use 1,000 apprentices would yield a bonus of
+15. The diﬃculty modiﬁer would be +28 (15 x 2 = 30 -2 = 28).

be representative of the spell’s eﬀect. Use the accompanying table to
determine the amount to add to the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers.

Concentration: Use the “Spell Measures” table to determine the
corresponding value for the concentration time measure; divide this
value by 3 (round up) to determine the amount to add to the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁers. Add the concentration modiﬁer to 6 to get the
willpower diﬃculty, which the character rolls at the end of the concentration time. If the character fails the willpower roll, the spell fails. A
Critical Failure on the willpower roll indicates that the caster takes any
feedback associated with the spell, even though it didn’t work.

Countenance
The caster’s body changes in response to the use of magic. Some go
pale or even blue with a lack of blood ﬂow to their skin, others shake
uncontrollably or foam at the mouth, still others get bulging eyes or
swollen lolling tongues. This alteration in appearance lasts until the
end of the spell’s duration. Use the accompanying tables to determine
the amount to add to the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers.
Nothing unreal can happen here: no glowing eyes, no ﬂames
from nostrils, no unearthly aura, except as a psychic illusion that
only the target can see. The drawback to an illusory change is that,
no matter what the victim’s perceptions and predispositions were
before the fact, after the image is seen, the victim is forever ﬁrmly
convinced that the caster is an inhuman monster. Only those already
endowed with a psychic or magic ability are capable of accepting

Chapter 11

•

that image for what it truly is. Psychic illusions may be used only with
living targets.

Feedback
The magic user lowers her resistance to taking damage when she
casts the spell. This damage may not be defended by armor, Special
Abilities, other spells, or any other means. It may only be healed by
natural means (such as resting or suﬃcient food).
Feedback: -1 to the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers for each -1 to
the damage resistance total. The damage resistance modiﬁer drops at
a rate of one-half of a roll of the character’s Physique per day, with the
decrease occurring at the beginning of a new day.

Focused
When a spell is “focused” on a target, it stays with the target until
the duration has ended. Add the focused modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
The range of the spell, then, only determines how far away the target
can be from the caster. Damage spells that are focused on a target do
the same damage each round.
Focused: (value of eﬀect + value of duration)/5, round down, minimum of +1, per target.

Multiple Targets

The caster, a charge, or a ward requires that a gesture be made so
that the spell will work. Use the accompanying tables to determine the
modiﬁer to the Spell Total. If there is a diﬃculty listed, the character
must make an acrobatics or sleight of hand roll against that diﬃculty at
the end of the casting time.

The caster can place the exact same spell on more than one target
(but not the same target multiple times) without having to cast the
spell separately for each target. Add the multiple targets modiﬁer to
the Spell Total. Each target must be within the spell’s range.
If a targeting skill roll is required by the spell, using it on multiple
targets is not considered a multi-action. If the diﬃculties to hit each
target are within three points of each other, the caster need roll only once.
If it’s greater than this, each target requires a separate targeting roll.
Multi-target: +3 per target (including ﬁrst target; ex., three targets
is +9).
Multi-target with area eﬀect modiﬁer (area eﬀect aspect purchased separately): +6 per target (including ﬁrst target; ex., three targets is +18).

Incantations

Unreal Effect

The caster, a charge, or a ward requires that a word or phrase be
said so that the spell will work. Use the accompanying tables to determine the modiﬁer to the Spell Total. If there is a diﬃculty listed, the
character must make an artist roll against that diﬃculty at the end of
the casting time.

When this optional aspect is used, it turns a heretofore real magic
spell into an illusion. The eﬀects are not real — they are just perceived
as real.
The spell’s eﬀect is automatically believed unless a target or an
observer actually states otherwise. Then, depending on the “Disbelief
Diﬃculty” (see the accompanying table), the illusion may lose all of
its eﬀects. The easier an illusion is to disbelieve, the more the modiﬁer
is worth (the “Modiﬁer Multiplier”).
Since the eﬀect is what is being tampered with, the spell eﬀect’s value
directly controls how much the modiﬁer can be worth.
Start with the spell eﬀect’s value, determined way back in “Spell
Eﬀect’s Value.” Then, when you decide how hard it is for a character
to disbelieve the illusion, multiply the eﬀect’s value by the modiﬁer
multiplier. Round up. The resulting number is added to the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁers.

Example: A spell’s eﬀect is 5D in damage, so the eﬀect has a value
of 15, and the spell has a duration of 10 seconds (two rounds), so the
duration has a value of 5. The cost of the focused optional aspect is
(15 + 5)/5, or +4.

(rounds up to 23).

Magic • Page 93
The guidelines for disbelief are as follows:
• Any player’s character can disbelieve
at any time he sees a spell’s eﬀect occur
but, if the eﬀect was used during a conﬂict
round, this counts as an action.
• Gamemaster characters should only
disbelieve when the gamemaster thinks
it is appropriate, or when the character
using the spell uses it quite often (and
eﬀectively).

Unreal Effect —

• When a character disbelieves, he
generates a Perception or investigation total. If the total is equal to or
higher than the disbelief diﬃculty, he is successful. The spell has no
aﬀect on him whatsoever — it does not disappear, but any eﬀects it
had do not apply to him.
• If a character is encouraged to disbelieve by another character who
has successfully disbelieved (and who he trusts or who can persuade
him), he gains +4 to his Perception or investigation total.
• A character who has disbelieved a spell will not believe in the eﬀect
later if it comes from the same source in the same way. As one example,
if the character disbelieves the eﬀect of a particular wand of power, that
wand of power will never be eﬀective against him again, but he may or
may not believe in other magical wands.
• The character who uses or creates the spell’s eﬀect knows it is an
illusion and can never be aﬀected by its eﬀect.
• The gamemaster can, and should, apply diﬃculty modiﬁers to
the disbelief diﬃculty based on how believable (or ridiculous) the
spell seems to be.
• In the event a character takes damage or suﬀers some sort of
debilitating eﬀect from an illusion that would, logically, disappear after
he disbelieves the illusion, it does.
Example: If a character falls into a “trap” and takes damage from
falling, and then ﬁnds out the whole pit was an illusion, he’ll be
healthy. But, a character who is “killed” by an illusion is dead unless
another character, who does not believe the illusion can, ﬁrst, perform
a medicine total equal to 21 and then, second, help him disbelieve the
illusion. This has to be done within a number of hours equal to three
times the character’s Perception attribute — otherwise, he slips into an
irreversible coma and dies.
Warning: do not overuse this modiﬁer. Once the players are clued
into what the gamemaster is doing, she’ll never get another illusionary spell through on them. The best way to use this is to have a nasty
gamemaster character mage research a number of spells two ways, as
both “real” eﬀect and “unreal.” He then casts the illusionary versions
(with the lower diﬃculty number) until someone ﬁgures out they’re
not real. Then, just for fun, he switches.
Imagine the look on the player’s faces when their characters charge
through the “illusionary” wall of ﬁery death and ﬁnd out it’s a bit more
substantial than they ﬁrst thought. It’ll drive them nuts.
There are a few things to remember when casting unreal eﬀects. The
spell does not aﬀect the caster. He knows it’s illusionary. So a character

Modiﬁer

can’t make an unreal bridge over a ravine and walk across
it. Using the same example, if someone other than the
caster believed in the bridge, they could walk across it,
maybe. They would unconsciously use any means at their
disposal to cross the chasm without realizing it. If they
couldn’t locate a way, they would ﬁnd some reason that
they could not cross the bridge. An illusionary bridge
doesn’t allow people to walk on air, nor can it cause people
to jump oﬀ a cliﬀ and die without realizing it.

Variable Duration
The caster may turn on and oﬀ the spell as many times as desired
before the duration expires. Add the variable duration modiﬁer to the
Spell Total.
The duration lasts from the time the spell is cast until the duration
time is up, regardless of the number of times or how long the spell is
turned on or oﬀ.
Oﬀ-only: +4.
On/oﬀ switch: +8.
Extended duration (separate from oﬀ-only and switch; extended
duration time measure — not value — added at spell casting if desired):
+1 per time value (example: a spell with a base duration of 60 seconds,
which has a time value of 9; to add another 60 seconds is +9).

Variable Effect
The caster may change the amount of the spell’s eﬀect when he casts
the spell. Add the variable eﬀect modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
Raising and lowering the eﬀect’s amount (die code or bonus) add
to the Spell Total separately. Be sure to specify in the spell’s description
the maximum or minimum eﬀect. If the spell has multiple eﬀects, each
variable eﬀect must be purchased separately for each eﬀect (though not all
eﬀects need have the same variable eﬀect aspect, if they have it at all).

Chapter 11

Page 94

Variable eﬀect: +1 for every pip or point per direction per eﬀect.
(There are three pips in one die.)

Variable Movement
The caster can control the movement of the spell’s eﬀect. Add the
variable movement modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
Accuracy bonus: +2 for each +1 bonus to the targeting skill total.
Bending: +1 to bend around obstacles smaller than the target; +3
to bend around obstacles the same size or smaller than the target; +5
to send the spell after a target the caster can’t see but the caster gets a
+4D (+12) modiﬁer to the targeting diﬃculty.
Movement of eﬀect: To move a spell associated with a target (such
as a ﬂight or telekinesis spell), or to make an otherwise stationary
eﬀect move (such as an illusion), the spell needs this optional aspect.
Determine the desired speed measure (in meters per round) and its
corresponding value on the “Spell Measures” table and add 1 to it; this
is the cost of the movement of eﬀect aspect.

Other Alterants
A spell might involve an expansion of its eﬀect not related to one
of the other aspects presented herein. Use the accompanying table to
decide how much the alterant changes the spell and add the related
modiﬁer to the Spell Total.

Other Conditions
There might be other circumstances the spell requires in order to
work. Compare the condition concept to the accompanying table to
determine the amount to add to the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers.

Final Spell Total and Spell Difﬁculty
Once you have determined all of the factors involved with casting
the spell, add the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers to the Spell Total
to get the Final Spell Total. Then divide the Final Spell Total by 2,
rounding up. This is the diﬃculty the caster must meet or beat with
the appropriate Magic skill.

Minimum Spell Total
Negative Spell Total modiﬁers may not reduce the positive Spell
Total to lower than 20 for most spells, making the spell diﬃculty no
less than 10.

Cantrips
Cantrips, also known as glamours, are small, simple, everyday spells.
They may have maximum Final Spell Totals of 10 and minimum diﬃculties of 2. Their duration values must be 9 (one minute) or less and their
casting values must be 4 (one round) or less. Cantrips may not have the
following optional aspects: change target, charges, community, focused,
or variable eﬀect. Components may only be of the ordinary, very common, or common variety, though, if the player can make a good case
for it, the gamemaster may allow a component of a higher level that is
not destroyed to be used (such as a personal staﬀ or ring). Gestures and
incantations may oﬀer no more than a -2 modiﬁer each, and no cantrip
may have more than one of each. Modiﬁers from the generic “other
aspects” category may oﬀer no more than a -1 adjustment.

Design Time
A player who learns this magic system can probably come up with
a basic spell in a matter of minutes. The gamemaster can review it
quickly, and it can be used right away.
Well, not exactly. The character has to spend time working out
the spell, too. He has to experiment, do trial and error, and come up
with the eﬀect — or risk blowing himself up. The amount of time it
takes to design a spell has nothing to do with the amount of time it
takes to cast it.
To ﬁgure out the base design time, look up the spell diﬃculty in the
“Val.” column of the “Spell Measures” table. Read across to the “Measures” column to determine the number of seconds that the spell takes
to design. (Divide this number by 5 to get the number of rounds, or

Magic
60 to get the number of minutes, or 3600 to get the number of hours.)
Design times of less than ﬁve seconds round up to ﬁve seconds.
The character may rush the design, but this increases the diﬃculty
(not the Final Spell Total) of casting the spell. The minimum design
time that may be rushed is 10 seconds. The diﬃculty increases depending on how much less time the character puts into the task: +5 for
25% less time, +10 for 50% less time, and +20 for 75% less time. A
character may not perform any task in less than 75% of the normally
needed time. Thus, to rush an hour-long design time into 30 minutes,
the diﬃculty increases by +10.
Taking any other actions while designing the spell increases the
amount of time to make it. Usually, it takes twice as long, but gamemasters should adjust this up or down, depending on the circumstances
of the distraction.
Characters remaking a spell they previously designed or working
from spell in a book or on a scroll can cut their time in half, though
the design time minimum of ﬁve seconds still applies.
There is no roll to design a spell, though there certainly could be
an adventure in ﬁnding the right components or the perfect location
to cast the spell.

Spell Design in Action
Jasper decides to create a basic ﬁre missile spell, since he doesn’t
see anything like that in the precalculated spells in this book. Once he
decides on the value of an aspect, he writes it on the Spell Diﬃculty
Worksheet.
Starting Spell Total: In this setting, the gamemaster has decided
that spells aren’t easier or more diﬃcult to cast than average, so the
starting Spell Total is zero.
Starting Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers: The Negative Spell Total
Modiﬁers always start at zero. Jasper knows that, although they are
listed as negative numbers, these modiﬁers will add to the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁers total.
Eﬀect: Jasper decides that he doesn’t want to make a spell that’s too
powerful (and too diﬃcult to cast), so he picks 3D as the amount of
damage the missile spell does. He only wants it to do physical damage.
Using the “Die Codes” chart, he ﬁgures that this has a value of 9. He
writes this on line 1 of the worksheet.
Spell’s Skill: At this time, he also picks the skill needed to cast
the spell. Since it has to do the creation of something, this spell falls
under conjuration.
Range: Looking on the “Spell Measures” table, Jasper selects 15
under the “Measure” column, which has a value of 6. Since the base
measure for distance is meters, the range becomes 15 meters. Jasper
writes “6” on line 2.
Speed: Jasper doesn’t want a delay, so he makes the speed equal to
the range and writes “6” on line 3.
Duration: As this is simply a tiny missile, it doesn’t need to last long.
Again using the “Spell Measures” table, this time keeping in mind the
measure is in seconds, Jasper thinks that 3.5 seconds is long enough.
He writes its value of 3 on line 4.
Casting Time: Jasper wants the caster to do this quickly, so, referring
to the “Spell Measures” table, he decides on a time of 1.5 seconds. This
allows the caster to perform it in the same round as its eﬀect. This is his

•

Page 95

ﬁrst Negative Spell Total Modiﬁer,
so he writes the casting time’s value
of 1 in the bottom of the worksheet,
on line 5.
Optional Aspects: Jasper
decides at this point to skip the
optional aspects — he’s in a hurry.
He writes “0” on lines 6 through
23 of the worksheet.
Finishing the Spell: Jasper ﬁrst
adds the lines related to the Spell
Total and gets 24. Then he adds
the lines dealing with the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁers and gets 1. He
subtracts 1 from 24 to get 23. Dividing this by 2 and rounding up, she
ﬁnds that the diﬃculty to cast this
spell is 12. Jasper realizes, because
of the rounding, he could go back
and add 1 to the damage, which
would give him, after subtracting
the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers,
an even 24 to divide. He decides
that he’ll do that next time.
Design Time: Jasper wants to
ﬁnd out how quickly his mage can
use the new spell. He looks up the
spell diﬃculty of 12 on the “Spell
Measures” chart to ﬁnd the equivalent measure of 250. He divides this
by 5 to get the number of rounds
(which is 50 rounds) and by 60 to
get the number of minutes (which
is about four minutes). Good thing
he thought of this before his caster
would need it!

CHAPTER TWELVE

Precalculated Spells
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter oﬀers a sampling of spells created with the spell-design
system in the previous chapter. Use them as is, or be inspired by them
in making new spells. See “Characteristics of a Spell” on page 84 for
details on how to read the spell listings.
All spells were designed with a starting Spell Total of zero, so basic
and additional aspects were added to the eﬀect’s value.

Cantrips
Aid
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 5
Eﬀect: 16 (medicine skill of 5D+2)
Range: Touch (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1.5 seconds (+1)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Other Conditions (-3): Physical contact with creature; may only
be used on living creatures
By touching an injured being, the magic user can use this cantrip
to heal harm as if he had 5D+2 in the medicine skill.

Heighten Attribute (Template)
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 3
Eﬀect: 6 (+1D bonus to one non-Extranormal attribute)
Range: 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gesture (-3): Mime an activity using a skill that falls under the
attribute to be heightened (complex, action diﬃculty of 11; examples:
sleight of hand for Coordination, lifting for Physique)
This cantrip gives the target a bonus of +1D to one of his attributes
for 25 seconds, or ﬁve rounds — as long as he doesn’t move more than
a meter from the spot on which he received the bonus.
Note that this is only a template for a spell and not an actual
spell, because it does not indicate in the description which attribute

is aﬀected. The caster must specify which attribute and skill to mime
before learning the spell (which takes one round).

Meal
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 4
Eﬀect: 1 (1 kilogram of bread and water)
Range: 0
Speed: 0

Chapter 12

•

Page 98

Duration: 4 hours (+21)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-6): A plain, cloth napkin (common), a small metal
cup (common)
Gestures (-2): Wave hands several times over napkin and cup (fairly
simple)
Incantation (-2): “Fill these with food and drink.” (sentence)
With this cantrip, the mage creates a simple meal of bread and
water, which sticks around in the system long enough to be digested
and actually provide nourishment.

Open Lock
Skill Used: Apportation
Diﬃculty: 5
Eﬀect: 18
Range: 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): Large metal key (common)
Gestures (-2): Mime opening the lock with the key (fairly simple)
Incantations (-2): “Open, Lock, and reveal your secrets.” (sentence)
Other Conditions (-1): Physical contact with lock
To cast this cantrip, the mage touches the lock with one hand while,
with the key held in it, miming opening the lock with the other hand.
After reciting the incantation, he touches the lock with the key and
turns the key. If the spell eﬀect’s value is equal to or greater than the
diﬃculty of the lock, it opens. If there are any traps or wards on the
lock, they are not circumvented by this spell! Note that this spell works
on any kind of mechanical lock.

Alteration Spells
Countermagic
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 19
Eﬀect: 29 (compare to skill total of spell countering)
Range: 60 meters (+9)
Speed: +9
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-1): 3 seconds with willpower diﬃculty of 7
Gesture (-1): Wave hand through air as if wiping away something
(simple)
Incantation (-3): “Your hold is broken!” (sentence, said loudly)
Other Conditions (-4): One spell, which the caster must specify
when casting this spell
The caster concentrates on the spell he wishes to counter, waving
his hand and shouting the required incantation. The eﬀect’s value plus

the result points bonus are compared to the skill total used to create the
targeted spell. If the countermagic number is equal to or higher than
the target spell’s skill total, the spell is broken.

Countermagic Ward
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 21
Eﬀect: 29 (compare to skill total of spell countering)
Range: Self or a target within 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 25 minutes (-16)
Other Aspects:
Charges (+6): 6 charges, with a ward to go oﬀ when a spell “hits”
the target
Concentration (-4): 10 minutes with willpower diﬃculty of 10
Focused (+6): On target
Gesture (-1): Wave hand through air as if wiping away something
(simple)
Incantation (-3): “Let no spell touch me!” (sentence, said loudly)
Similar to the countermagic spell, this spell gives the target a general
protection against spells. It is triggered by a spell “hitting” the target.
Up to six spells can be countered in this fashion. The eﬀect’s value plus
result points bonus are compared to the skill total used to create the
targeted spell. If the countermagic ward number is equal to or higher
than the target spell’s skill total, the spell is broken. Regardless of the
success of the ward, one charge is lost.

Deadly Bullet
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 18 (+4D in damage)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: +10
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Component (-11): Black obsidian (uncommon, destroyed), dart
(common)
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Focused (+5)
Gesture (-1): Rub the tip of the bullet on the stone (simple)
Incantation (-1): “Darkness of death.” (a few words)
Variable Movement (+4): +2 accuracy bonus

Precalculated Spells
This spell uses a piece of black obsidian to increase the deadliness of
a bullet. The mage utters a short, dark phrase while gently stroking the
tip of the bullet across the stone. The darkness travels into the bullet,
draining the stone of its pigment.
To release the spell, the caster inserts it into an appropriate gun
within ﬁve rounds of casting the spell. The gun’s user must generate an
marksmanship total, adding a +2 bonus for the increased accuracy of
the spell, against the combat diﬃculty for the target. The target must
be within range of the spell, or the bullet merely does its normal eﬀect.
The target takes an additional 4D in damage in the round the bullet
hits and for the next four rounds. The spell ends if the target moves
beyond the spell’s range.

Drain Toughness
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 24
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: +8
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 15 seconds/3 rounds (-6)
Other Aspects:
Components (-16): Blood of a great cat (very rare, destroyed), funnel (common, destroyed)
Gesture (-1): Pick up an item and pull it closer (simple)
Incantation (-2): “Weaken and perish before my hand.” (sentence)
Caster focuses magical energies into a funnel, with the large end facing the target. When activated, the funnel pulls energy from the target,
and sends it to the source of the spell. The spell itself is not visible, but
it can be felt. It requires a marksmanship roll to focus on a target.
Compare the spell eﬀect’s value to a roll of the target’s Physique.
Multiply the diﬀerence by 3. This is the target’s negative damage resistance total modiﬁer. If this number is greater than 3 times the die code
in the target’s Physique (ignore the pips), the target is unconscious for
eight hours. The negative modiﬁer vanishes after one minute.
The caster receives one-half (rounded up) of the negative damage resistance total modiﬁer as a positive modiﬁer to her damage resistance.
When the spell wears oﬀ after one minute, the resistance total
bonus goes with it.

Fear
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 19
Eﬀect: 30 (intimidation skill bonus at +6D+2)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: +10
Duration: 2.5 minute (+11)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): An item owned for at least a month by the
target (very rare)
Gestures (-1): Point item at target (simple)
Incantations (-1): Frightening words (a few words)
Unreal Eﬀect (-8): Diﬃculty to disbelieve is 13

• Page 99

To cast the spell, the mage ﬁrst needs something belonging to her
target — his comb, his watch, a lock of his hair. Mutter a few words
of power, point the item at the target, and watch the fun. This spell
gives the caster an intimidation skill bonus of +6D+2, but only towards
that target. The target may disbelieve it with a Presence or willpower
roll of 13.

Apportation Spells
Alter Movement
Skill Used: Apportation
Diﬃculty: 15
Eﬀect: 3 (3.5 meters per round)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: +7
Duration: 4 minutes/50 rounds (+12)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+2): On target
Gesture (-2): Point at target, then make running motion with
ﬁngers (fairly simple)
Incantation (-2): First say, “I command your speed,” followed by
whether the target should slow or quicken (sentence)
Variable Eﬀect (+6): Caster may increase eﬀect’s value by up to 6
points on the “Spell Measures” chart
Other Alterant (+1): At time of casting, mage may choose to speed
up or slow down target (small)
The caster makes her target either hurry up or slow down, depending
on how she words her command. The target’s movement is altered by
the measure of the spell eﬀect’s value plus any (as read on the “Spell
Measures” chart).
Example: A magic user casts the alter movement spell to slow down a
charging bull. At casting time, he decided to use the spell eﬀect’s value
plus the full variable amount, for a minimum change value of 9, or
60 meters per round. If his skill total was one point over the diﬃculty,
the new change value would be 10, or 100 meters per round. This rate
would then be added to the bull’s current movement rate, undoubtedly
causing the raging animal to come to a complete and sudden stop.

Doorway Home
Skill Used: Apportation
Diﬃculty: 18
Eﬀect: 11 (passage can handle up to 150 kg.)
Range: 100 kilometers (+25)
Speed: +25
Duration: 2 rounds (+5)
Casting Time: 2 hours 45 minutes (-20)
Other Aspects:
Charge (+2): 3 charges
Components (-2): Something from the location (ordinary,
destroyed)
Concentration (-6): 40 minutes with willpower diﬃculty of 12
Incantations (-2): A statement describing the place (sentence)

Chapter 12

•

Page 100

Gestures (-3): Pantomime building a doorway (complex; artist roll
with diﬃculty of 11)
After the mage casts the spell, she has ﬁrmly ﬁxed in her mind three
uses of it. When she releases the spell, she opens a doorway in front of
her through which she may step through and instantly be transported
somewhere else. The points the skill total is above the diﬃculty may be
added to the eﬀect’s value (thus increasing the amount that can travel
through the doorway). An unbreakable barrier over the doorway resists
weight of a greater amount than what the spell can handle to go through
the doorway. The doorway remains open for two rounds, allowing up
to two passages of material weighing no more than 150 kilograms.

Relocate Person
Skill Used: Apportation
Diﬃculty: 13
Eﬀect: 11 (teleport up to 150 kg.)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: +10
Duration: 1.5 rounds (+1)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Charge (+2): 3 charges
Gestures (-2): Point to target then point in direction of new location (fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): “Go there.” (one or two words)
After the mage casts the spell, she has ﬁrmly ﬁxed in her mind three
uses of it. When she releases the spell, she points at her intended target,
which will be instantly teleported to the range of the spell. The result
points bonus may be added either to the value of the weight transported
or the distance traveled; read the new value on the “Spell Measures”
chart. The spell will not allow anything to appear inside a solid object.
Remember that a target who is aware of the
potential relocation may roll her Physique or
lifting and add it to her weight. The caster’s
spell roll must then beat that diﬃculty as
well as the spell’s diﬃculty.
Note: A similar spell, relocate item, is
identical in every way except that the eﬀect
is to carry an item weighing no more than
10 kilograms, with a value of 5, and thus
the diﬃculty is 10.

Retrieve
Skill Used: Apportation
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 5 (move an object of up to 10
kilograms)
Range: 1 kilometer (+15)
Speed: +15
Duration: 2.5 seconds (+2)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:

Gesture (-2): Stand on tiptoes, point out to imaginary objects and
then reach to pick them up. (fairly simple)
Incantation (-2): “I want to reach out beyond the boundaries of the
time and space. I want that object to return with me.” (sentence)
Other Conditions (-5): May only be cast in conjunction with view
(spell described herein)
Through the use of this spell, the caster can target something he’s
seen through a view spell and bring it to his current location (assuming he’s no more than one kilometer from the object). The object can
weigh no more than the eﬀect’s value (including bonuses) as read on
the “Spell Measures” table.

Conjuration Spells

Cage
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 27
Eﬀect: 25 (resistance total of bars)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: +7
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area Eﬀect (+15): Sphere with a radius of three meters
Gesture (-3): Mime escaping from a cell, then point to target
(complex; acrobatics roll with diﬃculty of 11)
Unreal Eﬀect (-7): Disbelief diﬃculty of 13
Cage traps a target in a prison of magical energy. To cast it, the
wizard mimics trying to escape from a cell, then points at her target.
If a marksmanship total beats the combat diﬃculty for the target, the
quarry is trapped. The cage is a sphere with a radius of three meters.
Creatures larger than that can’t be conﬁned by this spell.
The eﬀect’s value plus the result points bonus serves as the damage
resistance total of the bars. The target can disbelieve and thus free himself
by generating a Perception or investigation total of 13.

Communicate with Animals
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 15 (language skill with specialization in the animal’s “language”
at 5D)
Range: 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 6 minutes (+13)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Something from the type of animal with which
she wants to communicate (very common)
Gestures (-2): Draw a line on the ground (fairly simple)
To communicate with an animal, the caster places on the ground the
bit of something from that type of animal (lock of horse’s hair, bird’s
feather, several strands of dog’s hair). Then she draws a line from it to
her and from it in the direction of the animal or animals she wishes to
speak to. For about six minutes, she receives the ability to communicate with any of that kind of animal as if she had a specialization in its
language at 5D. She may add the result point bonus to her language
roll total. The caster may not move more than one meter from the
casting location.

Displacement
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 22 (search diﬃculty of 20 and image transfer of 2.5 meters)
Range: Self or touch (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 minute 40 seconds (+10)

•

Page 101

Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gesture (-3): Turn around and then start hopping from one location
to another, while looking back at previous spot before jumping again
(complex; acrobatics roll with diﬃculty of 11)
Incantation (-2): “Hide my true location from sight.” (sentence)
By bending the light around the target, an image of the person or
thing is transferred up to 2.5 meters away from his actual location. He
becomes invisible to normal sight at his true location, and his image
appears and copies all of his movements and actions until the end of
the duration. A character must beat a diﬃculty of 20 with a Perception
or search roll or a location spell to ﬁnd the displaced target.
Anyone touching the image recognizes it for what it really is. This
does not give them the ability to see where the target is standing. Any
area eﬀect attacks and spells will hit the target should he be in the
radius. Otherwise, only using items or other spells discloses the true
location of the target.

Flight
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 16
Eﬀect: 23 (Flight (R1) Special Ability plus the ﬂying skill at +1D)
Range: 0
Speed: 0
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 3 rounds (+6)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): One round with willpower diﬃculty of 8
Component (-2): Bird’s feather (very common)
Focused (+7): On target
Gesture (-1): Point at target (simple)
Incantation (-1): “Fly!” (a few words)
This spell provides the target, who must be within one meter of the
caster, the ability to ﬂy and the knowledge to use it for 10 minutes.
There is no visible means of convenience; the target can simply move
through the air by force of will. The rate equals twice the target’s normal
movement rate.

Helping Hand
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 18
Eﬀect: 13 (telekinesis skill at 4D+1)
Range: 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+4): On the caster
The caster can move items without touching them, as if he had the
Psionics telekinesis skill at 4D+1. See the description of the telekinesis
skill in the “Psionics” chapter for diﬃculties and ranges.

Speed: 0
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Area Eﬀect (+5): Sphere with radius of one meter
Components (-4): white pebble (common, destroyed)
Focused (+5): On pebble
Gestures (-1): Hold pebble between thumb and forefinger
(simple)
Incantations (-2): “Stone of white, give us light.” (sentence)
The magic user casts this spell on a small, white stone, making it
glow with a ﬁerce radiance that extends for one meter in all directions
around the pebble. The eﬀect lasts for 10 minutes. Once the duration
wears oﬀ, the pebble turns to dust.

Mystic Bolt
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 12 (4D in damage)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: +5
Duration: 3.5 seconds (+3)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Gesture (-2): Swirl hand in air as if gathering energy, then throw
it at target (fairly simple)
Incantation (-2): “Ah!” (word, said loudly)
The mage gathers energy from his surroundings and throws the
ball at a target. It does 4D in damage at a range of up to 10 meters.
He must make a marksmanship roll to hit the target. The bolt must be
ﬁred in the same round that the mage casts the spell.

Mystical Shield
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 18 (Armor Value of 6D)
Range: 1.5 meters (+1)
Speed: +1
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Area eﬀect (+2): One-meter radius
Components (-10): A simple ring (uncommon), handful of
colored sand (common, destroyed)
Focused (+5): On ring
Gesture (-2): Using colored sand, scribe an oval shape in the air
(fairly simple)
Incantation (-1): “Protection!” (word)

By tossing some sand in a circle in front of her, the caster creates a
semi-transparent oval shield of the same color as the sand. The shield,
about two meters in diameter, appears up to 1.5 meters away. It is
focused on the ring, which the mage must wear. It oﬀers an Armor
Value of 6D against all types of physical (not mental) attacks.

Voodoo Curse
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 6 (Hindrance (R2) Disadvantage)
Range: 1 kilometer (+10)
Speed: +10
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (+5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-11): Scrap from clothing target wore
recently or lock of hair (very rare); doll in the shape of
Human (common); several large, thick pins (common)
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower diﬃculty of 8
Incantation (-2): Description of what caster wants the target to feel
(complete sentence)
Focused (+4): On target
With a few simple items and a spell inspired by the rites of the
vodun religion, the caster can cause great pain to his target. First the
caster attaches the scrap of clothing or the lock of hair to the doll.
Then, while placing pins in appropriate places, the caster describes
the kind of pain he desires his target to feel. For 10 minutes after the
completion of the spell, the target receives a +2 diﬃculty modiﬁer to
the caster’s choice of any three skills.

Divination Spells
Detect the Living
Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 24 (search of 8D to locate a single type of creature)
Range: Self
Speed: 0
Duration: 10 seconds (+5)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area eﬀect (+20): 10-meter radius circle
Component (-12): Something from the type of creature being
detected (uncommon, destroyed); ﬁre, such as a match or lit coal (very
common, destroyed)
Concentration (-3): 25 seconds with a willpower diﬃculty of 9
Gesture (-1): Inhale smoke (simple)
Before throwing the spell, the caster should decide what sort of being
she’s looking for, because she’ll need a piece of it for the spell to work
(a lock of hair from a Human, fur or fangs from an animal, etc.).
The caster sets the object on ﬁre and inhales the smoke while concentrating. Once the casting is done, the mage can detect the presence
of any such being within a 10-meter radius for two rounds. The higher

Precalculated Spells
the search skill total is above the diﬃculty, the more information the
caster knows about the beings she seeks (such as location, number,
gender, etc.). The diﬃculty starts at 10 for a Human-sized creature,
and goes down for larger creatures, up for smaller ones, and up for the
number of other types of creatures in the area.

Scrying
Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 11
Eﬀect: 34 (2.5 months)
Range: Scrying object (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-9): Scrying tool with images or symbols (tarot cards,
playing cards, runes, etc. ) (uncommon); item the person owned for
at least a month or the person herself (very rare)
Gestures (-6): Randomize the tool and place parts of the tool in a
set pattern (fairly simple); interpret the symbols (very complex, scholar
diﬃculty of 15)
Other Conditions (-1): Physical contact with tool
By interpreting cards or runes, the diviner gains a sense of what
the future holds for the person who the reading is about. The mage
may choose to look for a condition that could occur up to two and
a half months into the future. She can see one minute’s worth of the
future. Use the result points of the divination roll to determine how
much information she receives in the following manner. Zero points
reveals confusing images. One to four points allows one useful fact to
be gleaned from the reading. Five to eight points tells the mage a few
useful facts, including the time of the occurrence. Nine to 12 points
allows the mage to note more details, including time and location.
Thirteen or more points lets the mage see the scene as if she were present, though in shades of gray.

Sense Past
Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 25
Eﬀect: 38 (66 weeks in past)
Range: Touch (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 66 minutes (+18)
Casting Time: 25 minutes (-16)
Other Aspects:
Area eﬀect (+25): Sphere with radius of 5 meters
Concentration (-5): 10 minutes with a willpower diﬃculty of 11
Components (-9): Magnifying glass (uncommon), expensive pocket
watch (very rare)
Countenance (-1): Skin turns sickly gray color for duration of
spell
Other Conditions (-1): Physical contact with object
The mage can learn about the past of a single object he touches.
He’ll see visions of events that occurred in a ﬁve-meter radius around
the object in the past. The mage can view events that took place in a

•

Page 103

past period of time whose value (as read on the “Spell Measures” table)
is less than or equal to the eﬀect’s value plus the result points bonus.
The mage can scan back to that period at a rate of one week’s worth of
images per minute of the spell.

Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 19
Eﬀect: 9 (search skill of 3D)
Range: 1 kilometer (+15)
Speed: +15
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Gesture (-2): Make swimming gestures with hands (fairly simple)
Incantation (-2): “Let me see beyond what I know to be.” (sentence)
The caster opens a tunnel of sorts in space. Nothing may pass
through it, but the caster may look through it to the other end. The
tunnel starts with a range of one kilometer. This range is determined
by the range value of the spell, and can be much longer, depending on
the success the caster has throwing the spell. Any bonus from casting
goes to both range and speed, being split evenly between them. (To
determine the bonus, subtract the skill total from the spell diﬃculty.
Divide by 2, and round up. Add this number to the range and look
up the new value on the “Spell Measures” table.)
The eﬀect of the spell takes the place of the character’s search while
using the spell, as it is hard to make out minute details.

CHAPTER THIRTE
EN

Psionics
What’s in this Chapter

Using and Resisting Psionics

This chapter covers the ability to manipulate the forces of the
mind for extraordinary eﬀects. The Psionics skills are available only to
characters with the Psionics Extranormal attribute.
An extensive, though ﬁnite, list of individual psychic skills is provided herein. While many psychics have only one strong psychic talent,
and most will have no more than a few such talents, characters may
select and develop as many of these skills as they desire and the gamemaster will allow. Remember that the list herein is not all-inclusive.
Gamemasters should feel free to develop other psychic skills for use
in their campaigns.

The character rolls a skill attempt (the activation roll) and if she
beats the diﬃculty set by the gamemaster, she succeeds with all the
concomitant beneﬁts. To continue using the skill, some skills allow a
maintenance roll, at a lower diﬃculty than the activation roll, while
others require that the psychic to re-activate the ability.
Psionicists can push their Psionics attempts when times are rough,
using Character Points and Fate Points; perform Psionics actions while
multitasking (unless they have to go into a trance); and anything else
one might expect for any standard skill.
A target can actively resist a Psionics skill attempt, assuming the
target is aware of it. See the “Mental Defenses” sidebar in the “Example
Skill Diﬃculties” chapter for more details.

Obtaining Access to Psionics
There are only two ways for a player’s character to get psionic abilities.
The ﬁrst is to put dice in the Psionics attribute and skills at character
creation, which costs the same as obtaining other attributes.
The other way is to obtain the gamemaster’s permission after play
has begun. If the player can come up with a “reason” for the character
to learn or gain psionic abilities (such as they were latent or were
acquired through a strange accident) and the gamemaster agrees, then
the player’s character may get them. The cost to get the initial 1D in
Psionics is 20 Character Points. After that, it is 10 times the number
in front of the “D” to improve this attribute by one pip. Players must
still purchase Psionics skill pips separately. If appropriate for the reason
that the character got the ability (such as having a teacher open latent
talents), a character may learn one pip in one skill (or more, with the
gamemaster’s permission) when the character ﬁrst purchases Psionics
after character creation.
Gamemasters are discouraged from allowing characters to have multiple Extranormal abilities, but it is possible, especially if the character
has several Disadvantages that show up frequently in each session.

Learning and Improving
Psionics Skills
Psionics skills may be learned between adventures, like regular skills.
It is even possible to specialize in a certain area of an Psionics skill, if
the concept is well-explained and the gamemaster approves.
The cost for a Psionics skill, in Character Points, equals twice the
normal cost for gaining or improving a normal skill. This cost is doubled
again if a teacher — simply another psionic with the skill at a higher
level — is not available to instruct the character. A character may learn
or improve one Psionics skill after each adventure.

Backlash Option
At the gamemaster’s option, characters who roll a Critical Failure
with an abysmally small total become disoriented and lose all of their
actions in the next round.

Delay
Few characters can use their psychic abilities repeatedly in a short
period. Should the character fail an attempt, the diﬀerence between
the diﬃculty and the skill roll becomes the time in minutes before the
psionicist can use that skill again. Delay is always a minimum of one
minute, and it’s measured from the moment a psionicist quits using his
talent to the time he can try once more. If it involved a Critical Failure,
that is the number of minutes before the character may employ that
Psionics skill at all. This makes it diﬃcult for a character to give someone
the evil eye more than once during a combat, or to read the minds of
everyone in a meeting over the course of a few minutes.

Other Psionics Systems —

Gamemasters allowing psionic character
s made using other
D6 rules sets to be transferred to this one
may ﬁnd it easier to
rely on the rules from that system for
those characters rather
than switching to the D6 Adventure rules
.
However, characters using other psionic
rules may not rely
on the D6 Adventure rules — and vice
versa. Consider each
psionics rules set as a diﬀerent and disti
nct way special mental
abilities manifest themselves.

Gamemasters may opt to ignore this rule, but there should be some

or increasing diﬃculties.

Psionics Modiﬁers
Diﬃculties and modiﬁers speciﬁc to each psychic skill are included
in each description. These generic and optional modiﬁers can further
aﬀect the diﬃculty, generally trading a negative eﬀect on the character
for a lower diﬃculty or a higher skill total. Note that none of these
modiﬁers are required to use any Psionics skill, but they can help.
Community: Unless the gamemaster rules otherwise, psychic characters may help each other, using the game mechanics in the “Related
Skills” section in the “Game Basics” chapter as guidelines.
Components, Incantations, and Gestures: Psychic talents only
require the power of the brain, although a person can have a psychological dependency on a certain sort of item to use his gift more
eﬀectively. A dowser, for example, could require a dowsing rod to do
his work. Someone else might feel a need to have a crystal ball or read
tea leaves or rub a lucky rabbit’s foot. This is a psychological crutch,
which can be reﬂected in the character concept as the Advantage Flaw
(R3): Minor Stigma Disadvantage, but it has no bearing on the difﬁculty of the psychic attempt. Nonetheless, gamemasters may allow
a modiﬁer to the Psionics skill total modiﬁer per type of additional
part. There is a limit of one component, one incantation, and one
gesture per skill attempt. See the accompanying charts for the skill
modiﬁers. This can be combined with a concentration modiﬁer.
Concentration: The character spends time preparing herself before
releasing her psionic ability. For each round in which the character

•

Page 105

concentrates strictly on her upcoming action (with or without performing related incantations or gestures), the player may add a bonus of +1
to the activation total or the ﬁrst maintenance total, or split between
both (the bonus must be split as whole numbers). Additionally, add the
number of rounds in concentration to 6 to get the willpower diﬃculty,
modiﬁed by the distractions listed in the chart on the next page, which
the character rolls at the end of the concentration time. If the character
fails the willpower roll, the psychic attempt fails. A Critical Failure

*Modiﬁer to willpower diﬃ

on the willpower roll indicates that the psionicist takes any feedback
associated with the skill use, even though it didn’t work.
Example: Four rounds of concentration gives a +4 bonus with a
willpower diﬃculty of 10.
The player must specify, before having her character concentrate,
which Psionics skill the bonus will aﬀect and how it will aﬀect that skill.
The bonus cannot be transferred to another skill.
Countenance: Psionicists’ bodies can undergo changes due to
side eﬀects of their psionic talents. Some go pale or even blue with a
lack of blood ﬂow to their skin, others shake uncontrollably or foam
at the mouth, still others get bulging eyes or swollen lolling tongues.

The physical shell can react in unpredictable ways to the eﬀects of
extrasensory perception. The corresponding chart lists modiﬁers to
the Psionics skill diﬃculty.
Nothing unreal can happen here: eyes can’t glow red, or ﬂames billow
forth from someone’s nostrils, except as a psychic illusion that only the
victim can see. The drawback to an illusion is that, no matter what the
victim’s perceptions and predispositions were before the fact, after the
image is seen, the victim is forever ﬁrmly convinced that the psychic
is an inhuman monster. Only those already endowed with a psychic
or magic ability can accept that image for what it truly is.
Feedback: For every -2 to her damage resistance total, the character
receives a +1 to the Psionics skill total. Neither protective gear nor any type
of Special Ability may defend against feedback. The damage resistance
modiﬁer drops at a rate of one-half of a roll of the character’s Physique
per day, with the decrease occurring at the beginning of a new day.
Link to Target: When an astral form, empath, or telepath wishes
to seek out a speciﬁc person, the relationship to that person can aﬀect
how easy it is to get in touch with the person. Include the Link to
Target Psionics skill total modiﬁer when using the relevant skill (see
accompanying table). Note that this is diﬀerent than an astral anchor in
that the character and her target need not have been in recent contact.
The gamemaster can also use these modiﬁers for honing in on speciﬁc
items (as with far-sensing) or extending the range of certain skills that
otherwise have a limited range (such as strike or healing).
Physical Contact: Close proximity to the target can enhance the

Basically, when the psionicist succeeds in penetrating the target’s
mind, the target feels funny. It may be something as minor as an itch
inside the ear, or the funny feeling you get that someone is watching
you somewhere. It may be more direct, allowing the target to make a
roll to realize his brain is being picked or even to identify the culprit
psionicist.
Result Points: The result points (the diﬀerence between the spell
casting roll and the spell diﬃculty) can help in a future attempt with
that skill or by improving some application of the current use. Add
one-half of the result points as the bonus to the maintenance roll, range,
duration, or other appropriate feature. (Round fractions up.) The skill
descriptions give some suggestions.
Speed: As most psychic talents are instantaneous in eﬀect, a Psionics
skill does not generally take more than one round for the victim to feel
the eﬀect. If a slower speed seems appropriate (forcing the character
to “reach out” with her mind), the diﬃculty of the attempt is reduced
by one for each additional round that it takes before the eﬀect reaches
the victim. After the initial skill activation, the psychic does not incur
a multi-action penalty for using other skills in subsequent rounds
between the Psionics skill use and its result.
Untrained: Many Psionics skills may be used (or rather, “experienced”) even if the character has no dice in the particular skill. As long
as the character has at least one die in Psionics, the skills represent latent
potential in the character — potential that may manifest spontaneously
from time to time. Stressful situations may jolt the character from one
realm into the next. All actions taken by a character untrained at the
use of the Psionics skill are at +5 to the diﬃculty.

Psionics Skills
Astral Projection
Psychics with astral projection may leave their bodies behind, wandering the world in spirit form — travelling far more rapidly than possible
while conﬁned within their bodies.
Normally, the form travels from the psionic at a speed equal to the
character’s fastest movement rate. It may pass through walls and people
with no impediments. The psionic can see and possibly hear and smell
(but not taste or touch) whatever is around the form. However, since the

•

Page 107

body is an empty vessel while the spirit is traveling, the character can
sense nothing around her physical form and will need to be protected.
A spirit that has no body to come home to becomes a ghost.
To send her spirit out of her body requires a Moderate astral projection activation roll and performing no other actions that round.
To keep her spirit out of her body requires an Easy astral projection
maintenance roll on subsequent rounds. Failing a roll means that the
spirit automatically shoots back to the body.
How well the character can see (and do other things, listed herein)
depends on the success level of the astral projection total when the psionic ability is ﬁrst used — not when it is maintained.
If the character rolled exactly the diﬃculty number, then she may
only perform simple actions (those that don’t require a skill total) while
using the astral projection.
At one to ﬁve points over the diﬃculty, the character may perform
search, investigation and other Knowledge and Perception actions that do
not require tools or character interaction at her normal skill die code
as a multi-action with maintaining the form.
At six to nine points over the diﬃculty, the astral projection may
perform any action (as a multi-action with maintaining the form)
except Psionics that does not need physical contact with another person
or thing, such as whispering, charm, con, persuasion, dodge (if there is
something that can hit the character), or running.
At 10 or more points over the diﬃculty, the character can do anything
that she could normally do that does not involve physical contact or
one of the senses the character is deprived of (taste and touch). This
includes psionics that come from the astral projection. Any actions are
also at a multi-action with maintaining the form. The character may

also choose to appear solid, as long as the form doesn’t move rapidly,
but this adds 9 to the maintenance diﬃculty per round.
The range of an astral projection depends on two things: (1) the
skill adds of the character’s astral projection skill and (2) whether the
character has an astral anchor or not. Use the “Psionics Range” chart
to determine the range (without an anchor).
A character with an astral anchor can further increase the range.
An astral anchor is a character (or creature) with whom the character
has experienced telepathy or empathy (see their entries herein) within a
time period in seconds equal to 50 times the psionic’s astral projection

die code (ignoring the pips). For example, a character with an astral
projection skill of 4D+1 would have a time frame of 200 seconds, or
a little over 3.75 minutes in game time. During that time period, the
character can project the astral form directly to that character no matter
how far away he or she is. Range is ignored, and there is no movement
between the two places — it is instantaneous.
The astral projection skill may even be maintained past the time limit
of the last telepathy use, as long as the character continues to focus on the
astral anchor. The projection cannot lose sight of the anchor for more
than one round, or it returns to the body and contact is broken.

Empathy
This psychic skill allows the empathic character to sense the emotional
state of those around him, to catalogue and identify strong emotions.
This skill can be useful in negotiation.
The “Mental Defenses” sidebar in the “Example Skill Diﬃculties”
chapter describes the diﬃculty to use this skill. Use the “Psionics Range”
chart to determine the range. Reference the “Empathy and Telepathy”
chart on the next page to ﬁgure out the depth of emotion the empath
can determine from the target.
There are many conditions that modify the diﬃculty of tracking
and identifying the emotions of a speciﬁc individual, especially when
attempting to sense the emotions of one individual in the midst of
a crowd. The accompanying chart provides some sample diﬃculty
modiﬁers.
If the character succeeds in the empathy skill attempt, subtract the
target’s resistance or the diﬃculty from the skill roll, and modify the next
empathy skill total against that target by half of that number (rounded
up). Once in touch with a target, it becomes easier to go back.
Characters may also use this skill in an attempt to sense strong
emotions even days after the person experiencing the emotion has
left the area. Strong emotions sometimes leave psychic echoes, and
a skilled empath may pick up on these. This requires a Diﬃcult skill
total, with the diﬃculty number increased by +2 for every day that
passed following the emotional release.

Far-sensing
This ability allows the psychic character to use his senses at a range
not normally possible, to hear, see, smell, taste, or feel what is happening
in distant places. Activating the skill for one sense calls for a Moderate
skill total. Maintaining the skill requires a Very Easy skill total in each
consecutive round. For each additional sense, add 5 to the activation
and the maintenance diﬃculties. Lower the activation and maintenance
diﬃculties by 5 if a focus for the eﬀort — such as a speciﬁc item or
person known to the character — is present at the targeted location.
Surrounding conditions may also aﬀect what the character can perceive,
from no modiﬁer for an environment that does not hamper the senses
in use to +20 for a completely restrictive environment, such as trying
to employ sight in utter darkness.
Unlike with astral projection, the character is somewhat aware
of things that are happening around his body. Any harmful actions
made against the far-sensing character immediately recalls him to his
physical surroundings. Use the “Psionics Range” chart to determine
the range.

Psionics
How much the character
can sense depends on how well
the player rolled. Reference the
“Observation Diﬃculties” chart
in the “Game Basics” chapter to
decide how much information
the character gleans from sending
his senses out. The gamemaster
should consider the observation
diﬃculty level as the maximum
number of points over the difﬁculty that the character needs
to get that amount of detail in
that round. If the skill total equals
the diﬃculty, the character only
receives extremely distorted and
almost unusable information from
his sense or senses.

Healing
The character can soothe the injuries of herself and others. The
healer may not give to a target more than his maximum Body Points
or Wounds. A character may use this even on another already healed
with the medicine skill.
The skill works automatically, but the character must be able to
see or touch and be within a few meters of the target. Use the healing
skill as if it were the medicine skill to determine how much the target
recovers. See the “Healing” chapter for diﬃculties and results. Any
general Psionics modiﬁers the character wishes to add that reduce the
diﬃculty instead add to the character’s healing total.
If the psychic character rolls a Critical Failure, the healing skill
instead does the skill total (with the Critical Failure and the highest
roll taken away) in damage to the target. This damage may be resisted
and healed in any way, though armor does not protect against it.
With a suﬃciently high total rolled, which includes a Critical
Success on the Wild Die, the healer may regenerate lost body
parts. Depending on the size of the missing part, the minimum
total needed to regrow the part is anywhere from 25% to 90%
(rounded up) of the target’s total Body Points or Wounds. (Take
half of this total, rounded up, if the hero is only reattaching a
limb.) The target gets the part back and 10% of the Body Point
total generated with the skill or one Wound level. If the total is
not met, the target either gets just the Body Points or Wound
back or gets part of a limb and 25% of the Body Points total
generated or the Wound level. This skill cannot bring dead
people back to life.
Healing can be straining; the character must wait a number
of seconds equal to the healing skill total before using the
skill again. Thus, if the healer had a skill total of 5, the healer
would have to wait ﬁve seconds, or one round, before using
the skill again. The healer may reduce this time by taking a
negative modiﬁer to either her damage resistance total or
the next healing skill total, at a rate of one point for each
second by which the time is reduced. The damage resistance

Refer to the “Information Diﬃculties” chart in the “Game Basics” chapter

character can get from the spirit. The
gamemaster should consider the information diﬃculty level as the maximum
number of points over the diﬃculty that
the character needs to get that amount
of information per minute spent with
the spirit. If the skill total equals the
diﬃculty, the medium only gets evasive
answers, though something in them might
be of some use.

Equipment
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter gives game mechanics for popular equipment, including
gear, armor, and weapons, plus how to purchase them. Game eﬀects for
various weapon types are also included. Gamemasters need to decide
what’s suitable for their particular settings. All equipment described
herein is of the basic, nonmagical variety.

Purchasing Equipment
Each piece of equipment has a price diﬃculty associated with it that
expresses how challenging it is for a character to obtain that item. If using
Funds as an attribute, to purchase an item, the player rolls the attribute
against the listed purchase diﬃculty, adjusted by the gamemaster for
the circumstances around obtaining the item (such as seller’s stock, item
quality, general item availability, and so on). If the Funds total equals
or exceeds the price diﬃculty, the character gets the item. Business, con,
charm, and persuasion could all serve as complementary actions to the
Funds roll, depending on the factors the gamemaster chooses to include
(such as local law, relationship of buyer and seller, and so on).
Any item with a price diﬃculty equal to or less than the number
in front of the “D” in the character’s Funds attribute is an automatic
purchase. A character may make several automatic purchases per day.
Any item with a price diﬃculty greater than the number in front
of the “D” in the character’s Funds attribute but less than or equal to
3 times that number is an average purchase. A character may make one
average purchase per day.
Any item with a price diﬃculty greater than 3 times the number in
front of the “D” in the character’s Funds attribute is a luxury purchase.
A character may make one luxury purchase every seven days.
When deciding on the type of purchase, include in the diﬃculty
breakdowns any modiﬁers due to an Advantage or Disadvantage.
Example: A character has 3D+2 in her Funds attribute. Her automatic
purchases have a diﬃculty of 3 or less. Her average purchases have a difﬁculty of 4 to 9. Her luxury purchases have a diﬃculty of 10 or more. If
the character also had Wealth (R1), she would add her bonus of +10 to
each of these levels, giving her automatic purchases at 13 or less, average
purchases between 14 and 19, and luxury purchases at 20 or more.
Failure on a Funds roll means that the character didn’t have the
money for some reason (maxing out a credit card, forgetting to transfer
money to the correct account, leaving the wallet at home, etc.). Except
when the total is abysmal, the character may roll again after a short
period of time and attempting to ﬁx the problem (switching credit
cards, moving money, getting money from the safe, etc.).

Unless the gamemaster decides otherwise, players may not spend
Character and Fate Points on Funds rolls.
The price diﬃculties given in the equipment descriptions in this
chapter are suitable for most post-1940s U.S. settings. Those not
available in pulp ﬁction settings are marked; modern setting prices are

given for them. Nonetheless, players may use these as inspiration for
weird science projects of that era. Prices do not reﬂect any modiﬁers
the gamemaster may wish to include.
Gamemasters preferring to use cash over dice can generate prices by
selecting reasonable monetary values based on the diﬃculty level given,
or by rolling 3D and multiplying the total by an appropriate amount
for each level. For example, to convert to U.S. dollars, use: $1 for Very
Easy, $10 for Easy, $100 for Moderate, $500 for Diﬃcult, $1,000 for
Very Diﬃcult, $10,000 for Heroic, and $100,000 for Legendary.

attempts, depending on how much material is used. A larger one
costs a few diﬃculty points more and adds 1D to two to ﬁve medicine
attempts, again, depending on the contents used.
Quick-draw Holster: A favorite among gunslingers, the springloaded quick-draw holster is only available for nonbulky handguns or
melee weapons. With this holster, drawing the weapon does not count
as an action, so characters may perform it in the same turn as using
the weapon without penalty. In addition, when the character engages
in a “quick-draw” contest, she can add 1D to her initiative. It does not
provide any special initiative bonus during normal combat.
Riﬂe Scope: Attaches to a riﬂe and allows the user to magnify the
target, thus increasing the accuracy at greater ranges. Adds 2 to marksmanship rolls for attempts at Medium or Long range. Must spend one

Rope, Light (Cotton): Inﬂicts Strength Damage +1 when used in
choking attacks; damage resistance total 3.
Shovel: +1D bonus to digging attempts, or does Strength Damage
+2 in damage with bashing attacks.
Signal Locator: This device, which has a restricted distribution,
monitors the signals of tracking devices. It includes a small display to
show direction of movement. Pricier ones can pinpoint the location
on a map.
Telescope: Adds 2D to vision-based search rolls, though the user
must take one round (and getting no preparation bonus) to focus the
telescope.
Tool Kits: Contains tool (and possibly parts or storage containers)
necessary for accomplishing basic related tasks. Adds 1D to relevant
skill attempts only if the user has the appropriate skill (usually repair
or tech, but investigation in the case of an evidence or archaeologist’s
kit, disguise in the case of a disguise kit, or certain applications of artist
or forgery with the artist supplies).
Torch: A small, lit ﬁre-torch has damage of 3D per round after the
ﬁrst when held in contact with a ﬂammable surface for more than one
round. A lit torch negates up to 4D (12) in darkness modiﬁers within
several meters of the user.
Tracking Device: Used with a signal locator, this miniature transmitter electronically signals the location of whatever it’s attached to
over a distance. Active devices emit a signal, while passive ones wait
for a signal to come to it before sending out a response.

Mystical Items
Mystical items are standard pieces of equipment or weapons that
have been enhanced through supernatural means. The gamemaster may
either give them whatever sort of game characteristics she desires, or
she may use Special Abilities to represent what they can do. Any item
that doesn’t somehow stay permanently connected to a character should
have the Limitation Burn-out (R1), can be lost or stolen.

Magical Artifacts
Forged by an ancient race, created by supernatural beings, or discarded
from another dimension, magical artifacts take many forms. Some are
completely beneﬁcial, while others have a secret or obvious curse.
Amulet Of Protection: An oddly shaped pendant on a thick leather
cord envelopes the wearer in a defensive aura (Attack Resistance:
Nonenchanted Weapons (R1), +1D to damage resistance total, with
Limitation: Burn-out (R1), can be lost or stolen).
Enchanted Dagger: The weapon gives the user a greater chance of
harming magical creatures (Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon: Dagger
(R1), +1D damage, with Magically Empowered (R2) and Burn-out
(R1), can be lost or stolen).
Ring Of Power: With this ring, the user can cast low-level magical
spells (Increased Attribute: Magic (R3), +1D; Skill Bonus: Magic Skills
(R1), +1 to alteration, apportation, and conjuration totals; both with
Burn-out (R1), can be lost or stolen)

Holy Items
Holy items are handheld objects representing a person’s faith. Some
are material worked into a symbol of the faith, such as crosses, stars,
ﬁgures, and writing characters. Others show the signiﬁcance of the material itself, such as water or an herb, or an action, such as prayer beads.
The higher the level of the spiritual leader (such as a priest, rabbi, or
other cleric), the greater the beneﬁt the symbol imparts. Additionally,
the faith of the user and the target can inﬂuence the eﬀect.
Warding Holy Symbol: Shaped from metal or wood in a sacred
representation, this item helps the user turn away undead creatures
(Skill Bonus: Intimidation (R1), +3 to intimidation totals, with Ability Loss (R1), only works on undead beings; Burn-out (R1), can be
lost or stolen)
Blessed Water Or Herbs: Sprinkled on the opponent, this causes
harm only to those with evil in their hearts (Natural Magick: Harm to
Evil, eﬀect: 5D magical physical damage, range: 10 meters, duration:
2.5 seconds, cast time: 1.5 seconds, Component: blessed water or
herbs, Other Condition: Against Evil Only, rank cost 10, with Burnout (R5), one-time use).

Protective Gear
Combining Protective Gear
A character cannot wear two suits of the same type, though he
could combine some types. The listing below tells what armor may be
worn with what other armor and the kind of bonus it can provide. Of
course, layering armor assumes that the two pieces ﬁt together — a
character couldn’t wear two helmets, even if they were made of diﬀerent materials. For protective gear not listed here, use the type in this

chart that the armor in question most closely resembles to determine
what it can be combined with.
Each additional layer of armor increases Reﬂexes-based diﬃculties
by +4 or more, depending on the joint ﬂexibility of the pieces.
Except armor providing less than a full die of protection, any allowed
combination oﬀers the character the complete armor bonus for both
layers, up to any maximums dictated by the game.
Hides and Fur, Bone and Hide: May be worn over any other type
of armor. May not be worn under anything. Adds a maximum of 1 to
the Armor Value of the total combination.
Soft Leather, Canvas, Heavy Khaki: May be worn over or under
any other type of armor. Adds a maximum of 1 to the Armor Value
of the total combination.
Padded, Woven Metal Fabric: May be worn under any type of armor
or over soft leather, canvas, heavy khaki, chain mail, padded, or metal
fabric (though two armors of the same type may not be combined).
Chain Mail: May be worn over or under any other type of armor.
Reﬂec: A reﬂective material layered on a thin plastic base, this may
be worn over any other armor or over or under clothes.
Plate Mail, Bulletproof Vest, Flak Jacket, Light Kevlar, Heavy
Kevlar, Ceramic Armor: May not be worn under anything. May be
worn over soft leather, canvas, heavy khaki, metallic woven fabric, or

Encumbrance Option
Wearing a lot of protective gear can make performing certain actions
challenging. For every full die in the Armor Value, the character gets
a +1 to all Reﬂexes-based diﬃculties.

Maximum Damage Resistance Total
Option
Some characters carry around their own protection, so it doesn’t
make much sense to add more to it. The maximum damage resistance
roll a character can have before adding any negative modiﬁers, Character Points, or Fate Points but including Physique, protective gear and
abilities, and other modiﬁers is 6D. Ignore any Armor Value above
this. Gamemasters may adjust this depending on how eﬀective they
want protective gear to be.

Weapons
Terminology
Damage: Damage is the amount of harm a weapon does per single
shot (other settings, such as burst, modify this). Melee, thrown, and
those missile weapons relying a person’s strength to determine their
power are enhanced by the character’s Strength Damage (see page 60
on determine the die code). Weapons aﬀected by strength have a “+” in
front of their damage die code. Note that the damage is based on the
rate of ﬁre; most weapons have a rate of ﬁre of once per round. See the
“Combat Options” chapter for guidelines on other rates of ﬁre.
Range: This factor takes into account that the weapon is less eﬀective
the farther it is from the target. The values given are the maximums,
in meters, for Short, Medium, and Long ranges.

•

Page 115

For generated values, roll the character’s Physique or lifting. The
modiﬁer after “PHYS” indicates the number to take from or add onto
the total. These totals, in meters, determines the ranges the character can
throw the item. If the total becomes zero or less because of the modiﬁer,
then the character cannot throw the item to that range. (Gamemaster
who prefer straight values should multiply the die code in Physique or
lifting by 4, then add the pips to get the “PHYS” value.)
Ammunition: The number of bullets or projectiles that the weapon
holds. This is only included in ﬁrearms entries.

Types of Firearms
There are a lot of weapons listed here. Why would you not simply
select the weapon with the highest damage score? In addition to the
social ramiﬁcations, a weapon’s range, its ammo use and capacity, and
its various “ﬁre options” are all things an adventurer needs to consider.
The following explanations should help.

Handguns
Handguns are small and comparatively light, and usually easily concealable. In most game settings, most handguns are readily available and
not illegal. In fact, in most modern game settings, they are the weapon of
choice for most adventurers — carrying a .45 automatic or a .38 Special
is a lot less conspicuous than a submachine gun or an assault riﬂe.
These weapons are for close-up work. Even though most handgun
rounds travel a good distance with a high- impact velocity, they generally have a fairly short eﬀective range.
Most handguns are good for close-up work because they are easy
to aim and quick to ﬁre. A target at close range gets less time to react.
Of course, there are a wide variety of handguns — from the tiny .22
one-shot Derringer to the large .357 Magnum.
Most handguns hold between six and 15 rounds. Handguns may
always ﬁre once per round, and twice if they are semi-automatic and
the user shoots at the same target (with the single ﬁre as multi combat
option). Handguns cannot ﬁre full auto — a handgun that can do that
is classiﬁed as a submachine gun in these rules.

Riﬂes
Single-shot riﬂes, such as most hunting riﬂes or the lever action
.30-30, are also very common, and not overly regulated in most game
settings. True, they attract considerable attention in cities, but most
small towns in modern game settings don’t have a problem with them
— and they are perfectly acceptable in the wilderness.

Riﬂes tend to have longer eﬀective ranges than any other weapon
(barring the machine gun), and they have slightly better damage die
codes than handguns, mainly because (in general) they maintain better
velocities over distance and are capable of ﬁring larger rounds.
While some riﬂes only hold single bullets, typical riﬂes hold six,

nine, or even 15 rounds. Usually, higher damage score riﬂes have fewer
rounds, since the bullets are larger.
As with handguns, riﬂes may ﬁre once per round or twice if they
are semi-automatic (using the single ﬁre as multi combat option). They
cannot ﬁre on full auto, since that is the province of assault riﬂes.

Shotguns

around in a tight arc to “bring to bear” on a close, dodging target. They
may ﬁre at up to three targets per round.
Machine guns are almost always belt or drum-fed, meaning they can
hold hundreds of rounds. However, many machine guns have cyclic
rates of over 500 rounds per minute. They seldom ﬁre on anything but
full auto, unless they are loaded with only one round (because of their
long range and high damage die codes, they
are often used by snipers).

Like riﬂes, shotguns are considered “civilian” weapons and are
not usually overly regulated. They attract a lot of attention in highly
populated areas, but only if they are out in the open.
The range on a shotgun is less than that of a riﬂe, but shotguns are
slightly better “up-close” weapons. They usually shoot a spray of pellets,
rather than a single round. So, they are more accurate at
shorter ranges and they do quite a bit of damage as well.
However, because the spray of pellets scatters quickly,
they do not have the range of regular riﬂes.

Multiple Targets —

Submachine Guns
These ﬁrearms fall into the “military/criminal” area. Submachine
guns are illegal in most populated areas, and they attract attention
anywhere. They are very eﬀective weapons for adventurers, but can
often cause more trouble than they are worth.
While most submachine guns hold around 20 or 30 rounds, their
rate of ﬁre is so high that they unload themselves quickly. A burst
ﬁres about one-ﬁfth of the weapon’s magazine, while a full auto shot
discharges the whole clip. Even so, a full auto shot usually settles most
diﬀerences between parties quite quickly.
Submachine guns may ﬁre at up to three targets per round.

Assault Riﬂes
Seldom available in many populated areas, they are heavily regulated
and usually only brandished by military organizations. They are marginally more acceptable than submachine guns (since they are less concealable), but they cause the same types of problems. Their ammunition is
usually expensive and harder to get than normal riﬂe ammo.
These weapons are like a mix between submachine guns and riﬂes.
They are larger and heavier than either type of weapon, making them
bulky to carry, but also more accurate than submachine guns over longer
ranges. Characters may ﬁre them in bursts of three to ﬁve rounds (burst
ﬁre as single), single-shot, full auto, or single ﬁre as multi. They may ﬁre
at up to three targets per round.

Machine Guns
These are truly “military only” weapons. A
character with a machine gun had better keep
it under wraps everywhere except the wilderness. It causes trouble and attention. Machine
guns are usually hard to get, expensive, and
their ammunition is not readily available.
These are heavy weapons usually ﬁred
from a vehicle mount or a bi- or tripod. A
single character seldom can ﬁre the weapon
while holding it. As a result, reverse the range
diﬃculties when using a machine gun (so that
Point Blank is +10, Short is +5, Medium is 0,
and Long is -5), since they are hard to swing

Page 117

Energy Weapons

Like machine guns, energy
weapons and their power supplies are diﬃcult to come by and
quite expensive. Some settings
may consider them experimental at best, while others reserve
them for the military and secret
government agency oﬀshoots. Their ranges are comparable to their solid
projectile counterparts, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter depending
on the design. Those relying on integrated power packs oﬀer three or
more times as many shots than a similar nonenergy weapon. Handguns
and riﬂes may ﬁre single shot or single ﬁre as multi.

Explosives
Explosives, the most well known of which are grenades, are one-use
weapons that bear the same stigma as the machine gun, but they are
easier to conceal. However, using or brandishing a grenade or explosive
always attracts unwanted attention.
Using an explosive can get tricky. Even though a thrown grenade
uses the throwing skill to hit, the character using the grenade should
not actually aim at a person but, rather, a place. Grenades do not, typically, explode on contact — they explode after their fuse (usually three
seconds) burns up and they damage anything in a given area. When
throwing at a speciﬁc area, refer to the “Grenade Targeting” chart. If
the grenade misses, the gamemaster determines where it lands.
Ranges for explosives and grenades represent how far a character can
throw them, which is based on the Physique or lifting of the character
modiﬁed by an additional value. As with other weapons, accuracy
decreases as the distance to the target location increases.

dart. Generally, characters may reload in the same round
as ﬁring or throwing (with a multi-action penalty), except
with crossbows, which require the character to replace the
bolt and crank it in place.

Missile and Thrown Weapons —

Melee Weapons
Most muscle-powered weapons are melee weapons.
Swords, knives, brass knuckles, clubs, and so on are all
examples. All of these weapons require melee weapons to use.
Gamemasters may allow characters to employ untrained
such simple ones as sticks with only the Reﬂexes attribute.
Edged or pointed weapons do half damage when used
to bludgeon instead of cut.

bonus — do not include the user’s Strength Damage — to determine
the amount of damage done.)
Generally, characters may rely on improvised weapons only a few
times before they break (regardless of whether a Critical Failure or a
setback occurred while using it), though ones designed to take abuse
— such a heavy metal pipe, ﬁre iron, or a screwdriver — can survive
the battle (including Critical Failures) and continue to function as
tools or armament.

Vehicles
The accompanying chart introduces a few terms unique to means
of conveyance:

Move: This is approximately cruising speed.
Passengers: The number of people, including the crew, that the
vehicle can carry. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the number of crew needed
to properly operate the vehicle is one.
Toughness: This is the vehicle’s base damage resistance die code.
It can also serve as a reasonable measure of the amount of damage it
can inﬂect. Players may not modify a vehicle’s Toughness by spending
Character or Fate Points on it.
Maneuverability: An indication of how easy the vehicle is to handle.
Stunts are easier to perform in vehicles with higher die codes than in
those with lower ones. The Maneuverability die code is added to the
driver’s or pilot’s appropriate skill total when that person is attempting to do something fancy. (Vehicle stunts are further explained in the
“Movement” chapter.)

Gamemaster Tips
What’s in this Chapter
You’ve made it this far, so you probably don’t want even more “rules.”
We’ll keep this chapter short by oﬀering a list of helpful ideas. If you
want more guidance, you can ﬁnd more gamemaster resources online
at www.westendgames.com.

The Tips
The most important rule to remember is have fun. All the other
rules in this book are intended to help you worry less about being fair
and more about enjoying developing a fantastic story with your friends.
Here are some ideas to help you with this.
• Before beginning play, skim the rulebook at least once. Refer to
it during the slow parts; make up the diﬃculties you can’t remember
during the exciting scenes.
• You’re in charge of the rules, not your players. However, ﬁnd that
balance between being too strict and too lenient. Players need to feel
both challenged and like they accomplish something. If the players
contend you made an error in judgment or presentation, rectify the
matter or make it up to them later.
• You are permitted to place restrictions on character creation if
you don’t think you can’t come up with obstacles challenging enough
for the players to run wild.
• Be descriptive. Keep in mind the old rule of “show, don’t tell.”
Make your characters and scenes as interesting as you can. Try to work
into descriptions as many senses as possible. Think about how novelists
do it, and follow their example. (All right, it is possible to overdo it
— you’ll ﬁgure that out when your players start nodding oﬀ.)
• Players know only what you tell them, so don’t expect them to use
a clue later that you don’t give them a chance to ﬁnd now.
• Have the players come up with a situation that you know is not in
the book? Flip to the generic diﬃculties descriptions (if you’ve nowhere
else to start) or the generic modiﬁers (if you already have a diﬃculty).
Then pick a number based on the descriptions therein and go with it.
You can also use this technique to reward player ingenuity.
• Hide the adventure’s text or notes, so your players don’t know whether
you’re changing something. It also increases the level of suspense and
excitement, because they don’t know what’s going to happen next.
• Adjust the dice totals to make sure that neither side trounces the
other too fast (although sometimes, that just can’t be helped, so you have
to add a few more henchmen or swarms of rats or a sudden gas trap).
• Keep a few appropriate ﬁller obstacles handy, like game characteristics for henchmen, rolling boulders, booby traps, critter swarms,
zombies, or whatever, for those times when you need to slow the players

down. Also, have a list of suitable helpers, such as lost key in a niche,
some handy berry bushes, a reformed thug, or a talkative child, just
in case the players need a hand.
• Don’t give your villains more ﬁrepower (or damage-dealing devices
or abilities) than could kill a player’s character in a single blow.
• Never let a player’s character die unless doing so is particularly
dramatic or heroic. Your characters come and go, but players, because
they only use one or two, invest a lot more into their development.
• Give new players leeway, but show players who persistently make
bad choices for their characters that there are consequences to their
actions.
• When there’s tension between the players, call for a break. It
might be as simple as getting a snack, or as challenging as reminding
the players that they are not their characters and they’re supposed to
have fun together.
• If you need to encourage players to get into their characters, give
them immediate, but small, rewards for doing so, such as a bonus to
a skill roll or a reduction in diﬃculty.
• Customize your scenarios to the skill levels, character options,
backgrounds, and goals of the players’ characters, as well as the kinds of
things that the players like (particular types of rewards, jokes, villains,
and so on). The players will feel like they’re actually participating in
creating the story, rather than being dragged along.

CHAPTER SIXTEE
N

Adventure Tips
What’s in this Chapter
The key means of play in a roleplaying game is the adventure. Thus,
here’s a chapter devoted to some tips on preparing and running adventures, including obstacle ideas, rewards, and generic characters.

Creating Adventures
Like most games, roleplayers must overcome a series of obstacles
to reach a ﬁnal goal. But in roleplaying games, that combination of
obstacles and goals, called an adventure, takes on the same structure as
a story. Both have an exposition, progressively more diﬃcult challenges
to overcome, a climax, and a resolution. You can use movies, television
shows, novels, or comic books to come up with ideas for adventures,
always remembering that the players get to decide how their characters
react to the given obstacle, instead of being dictated by the writer.
You, the gamemaster, choose the hurdles the characters must deal
with. You provide a goal and then presents the characters with a series
of problems that prevents them from reaching that objective. The
hindrances can take a variety of forms, from monsters to evil scientists
to acid storms to covert government agents, depending on the genre
and the particular circumstances of the adventure your characters are
working through.

Genre Types
D6 Adventure works well for a number of diﬀerent genres. When
deciding which one you want to play in, consider what other reference
material, such as movies, television shows, and books, you have to draw
on. Reference material can inspire you with adventure ideas, setting
particulars, and interesting characters.

Wild West
One of the most chaotic genres, the Wild West features gun ﬁghts,
chases on horseback, and the lure of hidden wealth, usually in the form
of gold, but sometimes a coveted piece of land. Generally, technology
is low, though weird science is possible.

Pulp Fiction
Set during World War I and World War II, the pulp ﬁction genre
emphasizes excitement over complicated plot development, missionoriented adventures over long puzzle-solvers. Few “civilized” people
deal with magic, though technology is being developed so fast that
almost anything seems possible.

Real World
The game setting is not far removed from the real world of today.
Often, however, there is at least one change — maybe magic has suddenly become possible, or aliens have invaded, or the time period has
changed from the twentieth century to somewhere in the past.

Super Heroes
Super hero adventures usually happen in the present or not too distant
future. Special Abilities are common place, coming from scientiﬁc experiments, random mutations, weapons, equipment, training, and more.

Espionage
Plot and character development — along with lots of ultra-hightech equipment — dominate the espionage setting. Full of secrets, and
double crosses, violence is generally more subtle than in other genres,
though there’s still plenty of room for a car chase with big guns.

Types of Adventures
The most direct way of creating an adventure is to select the goal ﬁrst.
Once you know the end, you can more easily decide on what types of
obstacles to make it interesting for the characters to reach the goal.
Caught in a Tight Spot: Escape from a situation that could cause
some type of harm to the characters or their allies.
Contest: The characters must accomplish a predetermined goal
more quickly or more eﬃciently than everyone else involved in the
contest.
Guard Duty: Protect someone or something from harm.
Foil a Plan: Stop someone else from accomplishing their goal.
Generally, the planned to be foiled has something to do with the
destruction of a person, place, or thing of importance to the characters
or to the entire world.
Mystery: The players’ characters must discover the truth about a
person, thing, or event.
The Quest: Locate and retrieve an object or person at the behest
of another. The object could have been stolen, the person kidnapped,
or a criminal who’s escaped justice.

Types of Obstacles
Once you’ve determined the type of adventure you want to create,
you must divide it up into smaller chunks called scenes, each containing one or two obstacles. A scene is triggered by the players’ characters’
arrival at a given location or by the passage of time. Once the characters

Adventure Tips
overcome or bypass the obstacle, they move on to the next scene and one
step closer to the goal of the adventure. Here are a few examples.
Adverse Conditions: Weather, terrain, and hostile or uncooperative
gamemaster’s characters can hamper the characters in
accomplishing the goal.
Gamemaster’s Characters:
The people that the player’s
characters meet come in handy
for all sorts of situations, so much
so that there’s a whole section on
them in this chapter.
Combat: In order to continue
forward or get to something, the
characters ﬁrst must defeat a creature or villain.
Diversions: Include extraneous
details in setting descriptions or
when the players’ characters talk to
other people. The details are more for
show than to further the adventure,
but they oﬀer some interesting roleplaying opportunities.
Information: The players’ characters often need to obtain information, and you can make this more
challenging by making it harder for
them to ﬁnd (two secretaries to convince instead of one), missing (part of
a needed tablet has been destroyed),
in the form of a puzzle or riddle, from
a questionable source, or giving the characters what seems like a
right lead but ends up being to the wrong place. However, make sure
that the information the characters seek really is attainable. Be careful
not to force the players’ characters to go through an enormous amount
of trouble based on clues and hints you’ve given them only to ﬁnd that
their eﬀorts were wasted.
Multiple Goals: Typically for experienced roleplayers, adding
the rumor of a new goal can force the characters to rearrange their
priorities.
Restrictions: The characters can’t use some of the regular equipment or must be certain to perform certain rituals, or there will be
dire consequences.
Time Limits: There’s nothing like a time limit to speed up a scene. This
kind of obstacle can take the form of limited supplies, limited ammunition, or a set amount of time before something horrible occurs.

Gamemaster’s Characters
During their adventures players’ characters encounter various allies,
enemies, and neutrals who serve to shape the story, establishing the
setting or helping or hindering the characters at critical moments.
Without these characters, nothing much would happen.
However, you don’t have to create enough characters to ﬁll the
entire universe. Save yourself work and carefully choose which gamemaster’s characters play the most pivotal roles in your adventure and

•

Page 123

design them in detail. Then select the less important characters and
determine most of their background and personality, and so on until
you come down to the nameless characters who need nothing more
than a brief mention.

Assigning Characteristics
Once you’ve come up with the overall concept for the character, you should decide on his
game statistics. Skim through the “Character
Basics” and “Character Options” chapters for
some ideas, jotting down whatever details
are important for the character’s importance
to the adventure and what’s needed to use
him. There’s no need to follow the character
creation rules exactly; instead, give each
character what you think they need to
play their part in the story.
The average adult human being has
2D in all attributes. Depending on how
much experience you want an individual
to have, give the character between 7 and
14 dice in skills.
Children will generally have 1D in
all attributes, with two or three dice
in skills, such as throwing (for tossing
baseballs, footballs, food, etc.), running,
swimming, tech, hide, con, and charm.
Older or gifted children may have more
or a greater variety of skills. Children
will have few, if any, specializations. They often carry a
favorite toy or nothing.
Elderly adults may have fewer dice in their Reﬂexes, Coordination,
and Physique. However, they have twice as many skill dice (between
14 and 20), to account for their greater experience.
Body Points for generic characters likewise depend on age and toughness. For base Body Points, use these guidelines: 5 for kids and elderly
individuals, 10 for ordinary innocent bystanders and most animals,
15 for minor villainous opponents, and 20 for major secondary and
leading gamemaster’s characters. Add to these values any additional
points as you deem appropriate.
Should you prefer the Wounds system, be sure to drop one or
more levels from the bottom of the list. For example, most animals,
kids, and elderly would take one Wound level (Incapacitated) before
dying, while minor character and large animals might take two (Stun
and Incapacitated), and so on.

Character Points and Fate Points
Cannon-fodder villains, such as army troops, henchmen, and merchants typically have no Character Points or Fate Points. Minor villains,
whose survival isn’t dependent upon the adventure’s plot may have one
to three Character Points and (usually) no Fate Points. Continuing
villains, such as those who may be used for several adventures or who
are subordinate to the main villain, may have several Character Points
and no more than one or two Fate Points.

Chapter 16

•

Page 124

Major villains who might be used over the course of a campaign and
are integral to an adventure should have at least 11 Character Points
(some characters may have well over 50 Character Points) and many
will have at least three Fate Points.

birds and small animals. The humidity settles against your skin like a
blanket of moisture as you walk away from the van. The gangly gray
trees scattered in small stands reach upward into the mist, and you get
the distinct feeling that something out there is watching you.”

Starting the Adventure

Believable Characters

Once you’ve got the goal and a few obstacles, you’ll need to give
the players’ characters a reason to go on the adventure. Often called
the hook, here are a few examples.
Character Goals: The group, even just one of the players’ characters,
gets information that could help get closer to a long-term goal.
Informant: Someone lets the players’ characters know about the goal
and gives them just enough information to get to the ﬁrst obstacle. The
information could be provided as a letter, a television announcement,
a classiﬁed ad, or an anonymous source.
In Media Res: Start the game in the middle of an explosive or
suspenseful event. Such fast starts put the players immediately on their
toes, thrusting their characters into the middle of the game before they
even know it. Once they’ve dealt with their immediate problem, they’re
thoroughly enmeshed in the story.
Mission Brieﬁng: The organization in which the characters are
involved calls a meeting and sets reveals the goal (though, of course,
not how to accomplish it!).

Running Adventures
You’ve successfully brought the players’ characters into the adventure.
Now you have to keep them focused and enthralled with the plot. If you
see their eyes start to wander, or they fall into a conversation about the
last game (or worse, what they watched on television last night), you
know something’s gone wrong. This section should help you maintain
an involving story and a sense of “really being there.”

Setting the Scene
Your ﬁrst job is to vividly depict the scene unfolding before the players’ characters. Where are they? Who else is there? What’s happening?
These are the questions you must answer immediately.

Description
The key here is to engage the players’ senses, just like a good movie,
novel, or television show. Try to use evocative words to give the players
a clear and vivid view of their characters’ environment. The best way to
learn how to provide such lifelike descriptions is to picture the scene
in your mind and do whatever you can to convey that same scene to
your players. You may incorporate movie or television footage you’ve
taped, maps and diagrams you copied out of library books, or even
illustrations you’ve drawn yourself. Sound eﬀects CDs especially can
help you set the stage for the characters.
Just remember that your players have ﬁve senses. Don’t just rely on
the sense of sight. Describe what your characters hear, smell, touch, and
(sometimes) taste. The following example engages several senses.
Gamemaster: “You step out of the van and onto soggy ground with
a squish. The thick, musty smell of the swamp immediately washes
over you. From all around you, you can hear the screeching chirps of

Other than the setting, the players’ characters will also encounter
other people who live in the game world. Your job is to make sure that
these gamemaster’s characters appear real to the players. Their words
and actions must seem appropriate in the context of their histories,
personalities, and ambitions. If a stoic military oﬃcer suddenly took
oﬀ his helmet and started joking around, the players would probably
just stare at you for a minute as the game comes crashing to a halt.
Play each character to the best of your ability. Make sure he does
everything in his power to achieve his goals, whether he’s trying to
thwart the players’ characters or earn a load of gold coins. This does
not mean that every gamemaster’s character should act overtly. Part of
his goal may be to achieve his objective undetected, or to make it look
like someone else was responsible. Rather, the idea is that the character
should use all of his resources — his skills, allies, ﬁnances, and so on
— to accomplish his immediate as well as his long-term goals.

Exciting Locales
Try to make each place the players’ characters visit seem diﬀerent
than the others. By doing this, you can make these sights engaging and
memorable for the players.

Personal Stake
Every once in while you should ask to see the players’ character
sheets. Look for background information and personality traits that
might lend themselves to a personal stake. If a player has written that
her character is extremely competitive, for example, you could create a
rival group that seeks to outdo the players’ characters at every turn. The
players will do everything in their power to make sure their characters
succeed more often and more quickly than the newcomers.

Giving Options
Don’t constantly force your players to follow along the prescribed
path of the adventure. They may have devised an alternate scheme for
success not covered by the scenario, and you shouldn’t penalize them
for their creativity. Instead you’ll have to use your judgment to run the
remainder of the adventure.
If the players feel that they never have a choice, that you have predetermined what their characters will do and say — and therefore, how
the adventure will turn out — they’re not going to have any interest in
playing. Part of the fun of a roleplaying game is the almost unlimited
possible reactions to any given situation. Take that away, and you’ve
lost much of the reason for participating in this type of game.
Sometimes the characters will have only a few choices — or at least,
a few obvious choices — and that’s ﬁne if it makes logical sense in the
context of the scenario and doesn’t seem like an attempt by you as the
gamemaster to dictate their characters’ paths.
Reward creativity. Give the players a reason to exercise their brains.
The more freedom they believe they have, the more they’ll enjoy the

Adventure Tips
adventure. When their characters make a mistake, they have no one else
to blame it on, and when their characters succeed, they feel a genuine
sense of accomplishment.

The Subtle Art of Misdirection
If the players can correctly guess the conclusion of an adventure while
they’re progressing through the ﬁrst encounter, the ensuing encounters
won’t provide as much excitement as they should.
This is where the subtle art of misdirection comes in. The object
here is to keep the players (and their characters) guessing and revising
those guesses through the whole adventure. You can do this in small
ways: make die rolls, smile for a moment, and then don’t say anything
about it; have the characters roll Perception checks, ask for their totals,
and then just continue with the encounter; ask a player for detailed
information on how her character is going to close a door (“Which
hand are you using?” “Do you have a weapon in your hand”), but then
have the portal close uneventfully.
You also have the option of throwing in major red herrings. If a
character starts tracking the players’ characters, the players will immediately attempt to mesh this new person’s presence with the rest of the
adventure. In reality, however, he’s just a common thief looking for
an easy mark, or he thinks that one of the characters looks familiar
but doesn’t want to say anything until he’s sure he’s not mistaking that
character for someone else.

Allowing the Characters to Fail
It’s that chance of failure that gives excitement to a roleplaying game,
so sometimes characters need to fail. If they roll poorly, or are simply
outclassed, or most importantly, if they play poorly, their characters
will not accomplish their goal.

•

Page 125

Yet, with each defeat, the characters (and players) should learn
something. They may learn a better way to approach a situation, or
they may stumble upon a tool or gadget that will help them in the
future. It should take perseverance and dedication, but learning from
mistakes will eventually lead to success.

Getting Feedback
Sometimes an adventure doesn’t thrill the players like you expected it
to when you were ﬁrst reading or creating it. As you run a scenario, you
should pay attention to the players’ reactions to the various scenes. Did
they stand up and all try to talk at once during the chase? Did they go
comatose when they reached the puzzle-solving encounter? Gauge their
reactions to your judgment calls and improvisation. The players’ words
and actions can convey a great deal of information about which parts
of the adventure they enjoyed and which parts put them to sleep.
Ask the players what they did and didn’t like. You could even have
them write you an anonymous note with a list of their favorite and
least favorite scenes.
Don’t take any negative responses as criticism. It’s takes a lot of work
to plan and run a game, and you can’t always please everyone no matter
what you do. Just don’t forget to listen to what your players have to say.
They may want to take the game in a diﬀerent direction than you do.
Compromise. Make sure you and your players have fun. If not, either
you or your players will eventually give up and ﬁnd something else to
do during those precious spare moments. View player reactions and
comments as hints as to what you can do in the next adventure that
will keep them on the edge of their seats.

Rewarding the Players
Part of the fun of roleplaying is watching characters improve and
develop. Gamemasters have plenty of options for helping that along,
though, of course, no single option should be overused or the players
will have no reason to continue adventuring.

Advantages (and Disadvantages)
Look through the list of Advantages for some reward ideas. Typically, when a gamemaster allows access to an Advantage, it’s a one-shot
deal, especially for particularly powerful Advantages, such as being
owed a favor by a multimillionaire. If the characters want a more
permanent access to this kind of Advantage, they will have pay for it
(in Character Points).
Gamemasters might also give free Advantages to characters — along
with an equivalent amount of Disadvantages!

Equipment and Other Loot
Depending on the circumstances of the present adventure and the
gamemaster’s ideas for future adventures, gamemasters may allow the
players’ characters to keep equipment, gear, and treasure that they ﬁnd
in abandoned temples or acquire from a villain’s lair. Gamemasters
may even want to plant various items in the adventure for the players’
characters to locate, whether to fulﬁll a character’s dream or help the
group in a future scenario. Should the equipment or other material
cause the players’ characters to become too powerful, too quickly,
remember that things can break, become the object of desire by more
powerful personages, or get stolen.

Funds
Characters might choose to sell some of their loot and put the
money into their bank account or investments. Depending on what
characters do with their money, gamemasters may allow a permanent
one-pip increase to each of their Funds attribute (because of putting
it into solid investments as determined by a business roll), or give the
characters a larger bonus to a limited number of Funds rolls (because
they kept the cash in a vault at their hideout).

Obstacle was easy to overcome (the diﬃculty numbers were about
three times the die code in the skills required): No reward.
Obstacle was somewhat diﬃcult to overcome (the diﬃculty numbers
were about three to four times the die code in the skills required): one
Character Point per low-diﬃculty obstacle in the adventure.
Obstacle was quite challenging to overcome (the diﬃculty numbers
were about ﬁve times the die code in the skills required; generally reserved
for the climactic scene): two or more Character Points per high-diﬃculty
obstacle in the adventure (depending on how many Character Points
the characters had to spend to beat the diﬃculties set).
Individual roleplaying (overcoming goals and playing in character): two to three Character Points (awarded to each character, not to
the whole group).
Group roleplaying (teamwork and interacting with each other in
character): three to four Character Points.
Everybody had fun (including the gamemaster): one to two
Character Points.
Accomplished the goal: one Fate Point.

suﬃciently challenged by the adventure, each character should receive
enough Character Points to improve one skill, plus a few extra for help in
overcoming a low roll at a future inconvenient time. Obviously,
more experienced characters will either have to experience
more adventures, or they’ll need bigger challenges.

D6 Reference Sheet
Generic Difﬁculties —

Observation Difﬁculties

Automatic (0): Almost anyone can perform this action; there is no need
to roll. (Generally, this diﬃculty is not listed in a pre-generated adventure;
it is included here for reference purposes.)
Very Easy (1–5): Nearly everyone can accomplish this task. Typically,
only tasks with such a low diﬃculty that are crucial to the scenario are
rolled.
Easy (6–10): Although characters usually have no diﬃculty with these
tasks, an untrained character may ﬁnd them challenging.
Moderate (11–15): There is a fair chance that the average character
will fail at this type of task. Tasks of this type require skill, eﬀort, and
concentration.
Diﬃcult (16–20): Those with little experience in the task will have to
be quite lucky to accomplish these actions.
Very Diﬃcult (21–25): The average character will only rarely succeed
at these kinds of task. Only the most talented regularly succeed.
Heroic (26–30), Legendary (31 or more): These kinds of tasks are
nearly impossible, though there’s still that possibility that lucky average or
highly experienced characters will accomplish them.

D6 Reference Sheet

Determining the Diﬃculty
Base combat diﬃculty = defense total
• Defense total = (passive defense value or active defense value) plus
combat diﬃculty modiﬁers
• Passive defense value = 10
• Active defense value = full defense value or partial defense value
• Full defense value = any defense skill roll + 10
• Partial defense value = any defense skill roll
Determining Success
If the attacker’s combat skill total plus any modiﬁers equals or exceeds
the target’s defense roll, the attack succeeds and may do damage.
Determining Damage
• Damage total
• For attacks that do damage not modiﬁed by strength: damage total
= roll of weapon damage die code plus damage modiﬁers
• For attacks that do damage modiﬁed by strength: damage total =
roll of weapon damage die code plus character’s Strength Damage die code
plus damage modiﬁers
• Damage resistance total
• Body Points: roll of Armor die code plus defense modiﬁers
• Wounds: roll of Physique plus Armor die code plus defense
modiﬁers
• If the damage total is greater than the damage resistance total, the
target was injured. If the damage total is less than or equal to the damage
resistance total, the target was not injured.
• If the target was injured, subtract the damage resistance total from
the damage total. Then either subtract this from the target’s current Body
Total or compare the value on the “Wound Level” chart.

*If cover provides protection, the attacker cannot hit the target directly, but
damage done to the cover might exceed the Armor Value it gives the target,
and, indirectly, the target receives damage. Most of the time, the attacker must
eliminate the cover before having a chance to hit the target.

Weapon is diﬃcult to use (character unfamiliar with technology,
object is hard to throw or grasp, melee or thrown weapon is more than 60
centimeters long, etc.): +5 or more to the combat diﬃculty. The gamemaster
may decide that such factors as experience, strength, and features of the
weapon (such as a well-balanced sword) lower this modiﬁer.

Strength Damage —

To ﬁgure the Strength Damage die code, drop the pips from the
character’s Physique or lifting die code (but include any Disadvantages or
Special Abilities), divide the number by 2, and round up.

*Note: Penalties imposed by each level are not cumulative and they are not
included when determining the resistance total or damage done by non-strengthbased weapons. Any additional damage less than the character’s current level
moves the character up by one level.
**A character moves to the Severely Wounded level if the diﬀerence is between
4 and 8 and she already has the Wounded level.
†Note: This is an optional chart for use with Body Points. The “Body Points
Left” column is based on the character’s maximum Body Points. Round so no
overlap exists between levels. Penalties imposed by each level are not cumulative;
do not include them when determining the stun or damage resistance total or
any total not involving a skill or attribute.
Stunned: -1D for all remaining actions this round and next round.
Wounded: -1D to all actions until healed.
Severely Wounded: -2D on all actions until healed.
Incapacitated: The character is severely injured. As a free action before
losing consciousness, he may try to stay up with a Moderate (15) stamina
roll. If the character succeeds, he may continue to act, but all actions have
a -3D penalty. If he fails, he is knocked out for 10D minutes.
Mortally Wounded: The character is near death and knocked unconscious with no chance to keep up. Roll the character’s Physique each round,
the character ﬁnally dying if the roll is less than the number of minutes a
character’s been Mortally Wounded.
Dead: The character is toast. Sorry.

Die Code Simpliﬁcation
As characters progress, often the amount of dice players have to roll
and add becomes daunting. With this in mind, this chart provides two
ways of reducing the amount of dice needed.
The fast way is to roll ﬁve dice, including the Wild Die, add the results,
and then add the die code’s pips and a bonus number. To determine
the bonus number, ﬁnd the die code (ignoring the pips) of the original
attribute, skill, weapon, or other value in the “Die Code” column. Then
read across to the “5D” column to get the bonus number.
Example: A character has a Natural Ranged Weapon that does 30D
of damage. Instead of rolling 30 dice, the player rolls ﬁve and adds 88
to the total on the dice.
The faster way is to roll the Wild Die, adding to its result the corresponding bonus listed in the “Wild Die” column of the chart.

Example: A character has a skill with a value of 10D. The gamemaster rolls the Wild Die and adds 32 to the result.
When using only the Wild Die, a Critical Failure only indicates
a complication or funny thing happening; it does not aﬀect the total
rolled.
Because Character Points function similar to a Wild Die, roll any
dice gained from Character Point expenditure separately. When using
Fate Points on a roll, double the original die code and use that to
determine the bonus number.
For bonus numbers beyond the 50D level for the “5D” column, subtract 5 from the die code and multiply the number by 3.5. Round up.
To get bonus numbers beyond the 50D level for the “Wild Die”
column, subtract 1 from the die code and multiply the number by
3.5. Round up.
