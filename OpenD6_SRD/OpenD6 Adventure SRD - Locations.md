+1D bonus to Strength Damage,
and they have a maximum throwing range of the character’s lifting roll (plus any relevant Special
Ability bonus). Their Toughness
generally equals 2D.
Light items don’t inﬂict any damage, but they
can be distracting. The target of a successful attack
has increased diﬃculties for the rest of the round
and all of the next. (The modiﬁer should also lower
the initiative roll.) The diﬃculty modiﬁer can range
from +1 (for example, from an empty cup) to +5
(for example, from a cup ﬁlled with hot coﬀee).
To be eﬀective (and thus inﬂict the modiﬁer),
light items may be tossed no more than two meters.
However, some items are more aerodynamic (which
means that they’ll go farther when tossed), and all
items (including heavy ones) can be dropped from
a distance.

Introduction
From the mundane to the exotic, our correspondents have brought together well over two dozen
locations, useful for ﬁller encounters, adventure
destinations, or campaign backdrops. All entries
speciﬁcally relate to North American places, but
those in other parts of the world should be able to
use many entries with only small changes due to
local customs.
To get the most out of this book, you’ll need the
D6 Adventure Rulebook. However, game mechanics are at a minimum, so players of other systems
should ﬁnd the maps and location descriptions of
some use in their campaigns.
Each entry starts with a generic explanation of
the location, followed by one or more subsections
that provide further details about the area. These
subsections include “Don’t Miss ...,” “Things to
See,” “People to Meet,” and “Things to Do.”

Don’t Miss ...
Describing one example location, this section
gives gamemasters a version of the area suitable for
quickly inserting into an adventure. Alternatively,
gamemasters can use the example as a source of inspiration for designing their own locations.

Things to See
This section oﬀers a quick list of items (generally
of the moveable variety) commonly found in the
location. They’re a mere sampling of possible items,
to get the gamemaster started on a few believable
details. Some of the items on the list may not be
appropriate for certain settings (for example, while
“video cassettes” are given in the generic library’s
list, a Wild West library would not contain them.)
The exact placement, number, and eﬀects of the
items are left to the gamemaster.
Should the characters wish to use items in a destructive manner, gamemasters can follow these
guidelines: Hard objects generally give a +1, +2, or

People to Meet
This section provides tips on possible skills and attributes associated with gamemaster’s characters for
the location. For further details on creating gamemaster’s characters, see page 123 of the D6 Adventure
Rulebook. For a list of generic people, animals, and
monsters, see pages 126– 127 of the rulebook.
When you need a ﬁller character or a base to
modify, use the following game characteristics.

Generic Person
Reﬂexes 2D, melee combat 2D+1, Coordination
2D, piloting 2D+1, throwing 2D+1, Physique 2D,
lifting 2D+1, running 2D+1, swimming 2D+1,
Knowledge 2D, business 2D+1, scholar 2D+1, tech:

Presence 2D, persuasion 2D+1. Move: 10. Strength
Damage: 1D. Body Points: 10/Wound levels: 2.

Things to Do
Wrapping up the location, this section gives one
or more scenario hooks or seeds. Not necessarily
related to the example location, they show some
ways to incorporate that type of location into a
gamemaster’s own campaigns.

Airport
Although airplanes had been ﬂying (and landing)
for years, the ﬁrst “air-port,” as a reporter dubbed
it, opened in 1919: Bader’s Field in Atlantic City.
Since those humble beginnings, air travel has become commonplace, and today the largest airports
handle about 60 million passengers, and almost a
million takeoﬀs and landings, a year. Airports have
grown to accommodate the needs of ﬂyers, adding goods and services to make the act of waiting,
departing, and arriving more enjoyable (or at least
proﬁtable). In modern times, prices in airports are
notoriously inﬂated (+2 diﬃculty to all Funds rolls),
although some airports in larger cities proudly proclaim their airport prices are no greater than their
city counterparts — critics point out that larger cities already have inﬂated prices.
Small airports will always have a place to eat, a
newsstand or other periodical vendor, and usually a

4

D6 Adventure Locations

bar. Large airports have goods and services similar
to a mall (see the “Mall” entry); particularly common are bookstores, specialty food items (especially luxury foods), gadget shops, luggage stores, and
general gift shops. However, anything that can obviously be used as a weapon will be unavailable in
airport stores. Airports also have shops and services
unique to them, providing services such as chairmassages and Internet connectivity.
Airports before the 1960s were relatively open;
so long as nothing was obviously amiss about someone, they could get aboard a plane (Easy disguise or
con roll to bypass security). In the 1960s and 1970s,
however, security took the forefront (Moderate disguise or con check to slip through); in an era where
terrorist threats are a real danger, security measures
have become extremely vigilant (Diﬃcult to Very
Diﬃcult disguise or con check, depending on the
airport).
In a Weird West or steampunk game, the airport
would probably be a ﬁeld where steam-powered
aero-planes and ornithopters make their questionable landings; the building would probably represent the standard type of its genre, from Western
ramshackle wooden buildings to Victorian opu-

lence. In pulp and 1950s-era games, airports were
simple but comfortable; ﬂying was an expensive
proposition (Diﬃcult Funds roll), and airports
generally resembled luxury hotels. Security in this
time was virtually nonexistent. From the 1960s and
beyond, the world became more dangerous at the
same time ﬂying became more aﬀordable. Airports
became more Spartan, while security was put in
place. In a near-future campaign, airports will probably vary depending on the cost of air travel and security needs; if dirt-cheap tickets become plentiful,
airports might resemble noisy, gritty bus stations,
while the return of air travel as a luxury would undoubtedly mean nicer terminals. Regardless, in a
more dangerous future, airports might come to resemble military- or police-controlled complexes.

Don’t Miss ...
When Cuprum Regional opened in 1930, its ﬁve
gates were deemed overkill by many in the local media. After all, why would more than ﬁve planes ever
need to land in the tiny region at the same time?
That all began to change in 1964, when LWH
Electronics chose the area for its transistor manufacturing plant, transforming the region into a
ﬂedgling high-tech industry leader. At that point,
traﬃc into the region increased, and the airport
changed its name to Cuprum International and
added another six gates in another building wing
(later remodeled to nine gates).
After 1978’s Airline Deregulation Act, Omega
Airlines selected the airport as its hub, and six

Adjusting the Airport
To simulate a smaller airport with this map,
simply “chop oﬀ” sections, and rename gates
accordingly. Cuprum Regional consisted entirely of Gate E in the 1950s (labeled Gate
A), while Cuprum International encompassed
Gates D and E (called Gates B and A).
If a larger airport is required, include additional gates and concourses, from Concourse F
and beyond.

years later, construction was complete on CuprumMcKinley International.
Although not the busiest or unfriendliest airport
in the world, Cuprum-McKinley is still confusing
to ﬁrst-time visitors, to the extent that an awardwinning book and resulting movie entitled Caught
in Cuprum used the airport as a metaphor for being
lost and harried.
Although many regarded Cuprum-McKinley
as being in decline in the late 1990s, the airport
used post-terrorism upgrades to rededicate itself
to enhancing the ﬂying experience. Its advertising campaign — “Come From Cuprum Happy”
— has proven successful. It currently employs a
team of dedicated, uniformed problem-solvers,
called Cuprumites, who can be seen running fulltilt through terminals or driving carts. The current
leader of this team, the charismatic Sandra Joule,
has a reputation for solving impossible problems.
In modern times, Cuprum-McKinley has consciously kept itself less packed than other larger
airports, eschewing dozens of duplicated cafes and
shops for fewer, strategically placed locations. The
remaining open areas keep claustrophobia to a
minimum, while rest areas of comfy chairs and exotic plants help soothe frazzled nerves. Critics complain that contraband could be hidden in these areas, especially among the plants, permitting illegal
goods or other substances to pass from one ﬂyer to
another. However, to date, authorities claim there
is no evidence this has happened, despite the fact
it handles over 400,000 ﬂights and almost 24 million people a year.

Things to See
 Plastic seats in gray or blue, connected on
bars in groups of three to six
 A line of white rocking chairs or small groups
of light colored overstuﬀed club chairs along wide
hallways and near large windows
 Light gray plastic tubs, about half a meter
long, by the personal security checkpoint, for putting in large personal items, plus little white plastic
bowls for smaller items
 Black, heavy plastic posts with elastic line

 Metal pushcarts for wheeling around oversized luggage
 White styrofoam cups of hot coﬀee
 Colorful bags of snacks
 Postcards in slots on spinning racks
 A cart selling sunglasses with a variety of
tints and frames
 Bottles of wine and beer for sale
 Shelves of national and local newspapers and
magazines and softcover versions of popular books
 Black or silver trash receptacles (most at least
one-quarter to three-quarters full of the remains of
various things sold in the airport)
 Backlit advertisements a few meters square for
local and national services and products (ﬁnancial
institutions, phone service, furniture, software, etc.)
 Rectangular luggage in blues, greens, browns,
and grays in a variety of sizes
 Purses and
briefcases in various
colors
 Pay phones in
small cubicles

Things to Do
 The players’ characters learn that a nefarious person might have found a way to construct a
bomb out of nonmetallic parts that do not register
as explosive. Is this all a hoax to discredit the heroes?
And if not, can they convince the authorities to help
them ... without panicking the airport?
 While in pursuit of an infamous villain, horrible weather forces the players’ characters’ plane to
land at the airport. While there, they realize: The
weather means the villain couldn’t make his ﬂight
out of the airport, either! Can they ﬁnd and capture the bad guy amid thousands of travelers — either with or without the airport’s help — before
the weather improves and he escapes?

Amusement Park

People to Meet
Most airport employees have 2D in their attributes, although 3D in Presence is common. Given
the service-oriented nature of the ﬁeld, people-placating skills are often needed — mostly charm and
persuasion. Security guards (D6 Adventure Rulebook,
page 126) and federal aviation agents wander the
halls and check passengers and their luggage in the
screening areas. Air marshals have characteristics
akin to security guards and have Authority: Law
Enforcement (R3). Pilots are common in an airport, and they would possess +3D or more in piloting: aircraft.

Amusement parks are fascinating places, designed strictly to entertain. Some are generic, while
others have a theme, like pirates or medieval times,
which all of the rides, games, and employee uniforms match. Some are massive, sprawling places,
while others are tightly packed little park. They
could be located on the outskirts of the city, out
in the country, or (more rarely) nestled in between
skyscrapers and oﬃce buildings.
Most often, they have rides and games. The
rides can be massive open-air structures, like a
roller coaster or a Ferris wheel, or less thrilling but
more atmospheric rides like the Tunnel of Love.
Funhouses are also common — these are similar to rides, in that people wander through them
and are entertained by their surroundings, but in
a funhouse, people usually walk through (instead
of being transported), and the idea is to be scared,
surprised, or confused. The attractions could be
brand-new, comfortably worn, or completely run
down, or diﬀerent attractions might be in diﬀerent
stages of repair or development.
Games are either games of skill, like the ring toss
or the waterguns, or games of chance, like Spin the

Wheel. Some amusement parks still have old carnival attractions as well. These can be little games
like Guess Your Weight or Strongman (where the
participant tries to hit the target with a mallet and
make the indicator to strike the bell at the top of a
measuring pole) or sideshows with strange sights like
the Bearded Lady and the Serpent King (which are
becoming more rare in the twenty-ﬁrst century).
Parks that exist as permanent ﬁxtures are more
likely to oﬀer a variety of rides, games, funhouses,
and the like. Traveling shows, however, could still
have Ferris wheels and some other rides, but might
not have roller coasters, and most of its rides and
booths would be smaller and more portable)
Amusement parks want people to come and
spend the entire day there, so they provide bathrooms, benches for taking a break, and concessions.
The food can range from surprisingly good to barely edible, but it’s rarely fancy and generally consists of things people can eat while walking around
— slices of pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, cookies,
and ice cream are the most common. Some amusement parks charge an entrance fee, which includes
all of the games and rides. Others charge nothing

to walk around, but each game and ride has a separate cost.
Traditionally, the amusement park is a place to
take the whole family, to go on a date, or to go
hang out with friends from school. People rarely go
alone, unless they are meeting someone else there.
Because the park is ﬁlled with sights and sounds, it
is an easy place to get lost — or to do something
without being noticed. Teenagers often take advantage of this to steal candy or pull pranks, but adults
also use the park’s cover for aﬀairs, drug deals, and
anything else they do not want to be seen. Even
though amusement parks are supposed to be fun,
some actually feel a bit sad, if the place is run-down
and barely making money, or even sinister, particularly traveling shows.

Don’t Miss ...
The Happy Time Amusement Park was built on a
large square lot. It has a massive, aging roller coaster
along the back end, a ramshackle House of Mirrors
and a cheesy Tunnel of Love on one side, a brightly

painted merry-go-round and other kiddy rides on
the other side, a peeling Ferris wheel at the center,
and a small, sagging ticket stand right in front. The
park also has a concessions stand and several game
booths (like Whack-a-Mole), plus a pair of small but
clean bathrooms. The manager’s oﬃce is along the
same side as the funhouse, back toward the corner
and near the roller coaster. An access road enters
between the manager’s oﬃce and the roller coast,
and then loops around. Once upon a time, this was
a wonderful park, and everyone came here on the
weekends and in the summer evenings. But it has
deﬁnitely seen better days, and now it’s just a sad
reminder of its own former glory.

Things to See

People to Meet
Most amusement parks have ticket-takers, booth
attendants, roustabouts (workers), barkers (salesmen), security, and the manager. Everyone should
have at least one pip in con or charm, and everyone
except security has one pip in business. The barkers
have +2D or more in con or charm, and the manager has +2D in business. See page 126 of the D6
Adventure Rulebook for the game characteristics of
security guards.

Things to Do
 Kids are going missing, and each of them
had been at the amusement park within days of
their disappearance. The manager claims he knows
nothing about it and that all of his employees are
law-abiding citizens. But many of the workers vanish whenever the police show up to ask questions,
and it is true that the attendants pay a lot of attention to small kids. Is that just good salesmanship,
or something more sinister?
 The amusement park seems to stay open late,
with odd customers arriving in dark vans. They go
directly into the covered rides, then emerge and go
straight to their vehicles again and drive away.

 An escaped murderer has vowed to get revenge against the woman who testiﬁed against him
— her and her family. The police continue looking
for him, but they’ve found no sign yet. Little do
they realize that the amusement park is always hiring people short-term and rarely asks for references.
Because the woman’s two kids love going there, it
would be the perfect place for the man to go — he
can watch her and her children and wait for the
right moment to strike.

Apartment
There are as many diﬀerent types of apartments
as there are diﬀerent types of people. Apartments
can have anywhere from a single bedroom to two,
three, or more.
The number of bedrooms is largely the determining factor when diﬀerentiating between apartments. Most apartments have a kitchen, bathroom,
dining area, and living room. More often than not,
the dining room
and living room or
dining room and
kitchen or even
sometimes all three
exist a single area.
Fancier
apartments may contain
diﬀerent levels with
bedrooms on upper
or lower levels than
the “living area”
(living room, dining
room, and kitchen).
Some even come
with other amenities
such as a den, a ﬁreplace, deck or patio,
or even more than
one living room.
Other variations
in apartments in-

clude multiple bathrooms, the number of closets (usually at least one per bedroom, but that
sometimes is not the case), and oﬀ-street parking.
Parking may be within an outdoor lot, a designated
spot next to the apartment, or an underground
parking garage.
Some apartments come with extra storage areas. While it is not unheard of for these to be in a
separate building, most are either in a basement or
parking facility located under the building.
Most apartments have a common area (for
example, entrances and hallways) used by all
tenants. While larger apartments may include
hookups for a washer and dryer within them,
most apartments have a washer and dryer usable (for a price of 25 cents to a few dollars per
load, or a Very Easy Funds roll) by all tenants in
a common area or no laundry facility at all.
Two apartment styles of note are the studio apartment and the “ﬂophouse.” A studio apartment is
basically an entire apartment within the conﬁnes of
a single room. The only separated room in a studio
is the bathroom, with all other “rooms” deﬁned by
whatever the tenant decides to put between them.
A ﬂophouse apartment is much like a studio except that it has no individual bathroom. The bath-

Hello, my
name is...

room is in a common area and used by all tenants.
A ﬂophouse also has no kitchen. It basically consists of a bed and possibly a table and chairs. Unlike
all most other apartments, which are rented either
monthly or yearly, a ﬂophouse is often rented by
the day or week.

Don’t Miss ...
This apartment consists of three bedrooms, a
kitchen, dining room, living room, and bath.
The front door of the apartment opens onto a
dining room area lit by a ceiling fan hanging from
the ceiling’s center. The dining room is ﬁlled with
a large rectangular wooden table surrounded by
four chairs and a bench. Oﬀ to one side in a corner stands a bookcase with two shelves on top and
doors covering two more below. Pictures and a
clock cover the walls.
Directly across from the front door is the kitchen. This tiny area is more hallway than room. It
is about three meters in length and two meters in
width. A long counter balanced at the ends by a
dishwasher and stove dominates the area. A twobasin stainless steel sink sits in the middle of the
counter. Cupboards occupy the space above and
below it. Oﬀ to the left of the room stands a largish
refrigerator, which has seen better days.
The dining room runs directly into the living
room. Separating the two is a bright yellow chair.
Oﬀ to the right of the chair sits a red couch ﬂanked
by end tables with lamps standing on them. To the
right of the couch is a blue loveseat next to a large
television on a dilapidated black stand. The stand’s
paint is chipped in several places, revealing the
wood beneath. A lemon-colored wooden coﬀee table just large enough to ﬁll the area without impeding movement occupies the living room’s center.
A doorway opens oﬀ the living room into a small
room that was obviously intended as a bedroom,
but it is now being used as a makeshift oﬃce.
Several bookcases line the walls and a computer sits
on an old desk, its CPU and monitor taking up the
majority of the surface.
Leading from the living and dining rooms’ other
side is a hallway down to the apartment’s other

bedrooms and sole bathroom. The bathroom is a
simple aﬀair with toilet, sink, and shower. A ripped,
mildew covered shower curtain hangs from several
rings on a pole above the bathtub, its bottom stuck
to the tub’s surface in several places.
The ﬁrst bedroom is larger than the makeshift
oﬃce and contains a closet, though with a single
dresser and queen-size bed, it’s quite full.
The ﬁnal room is evidently being used as a bedroom for children. Bunk beds dominate one wall
and toys are strewn about the ﬂoor. Colorful posters
bedeck all the walls and a table with wooden trains
on it sits underneath the one window. The room also
contains two closets, one ﬁlled with extra clothes
and toys, and the other being used for storage.

Bars have been around almost as long as civilization itself, and they have taken many forms. One
variant, the nightclub, is a comparatively recent
innovation. Bars and pubs oﬀer alcoholic beverages and a place to socialize, but often not much
else. Nightclubs, on the other hand, typically oﬀer
somewhat sturdier fare, as well as dancing and live
music or comedy acts. Even so, there are exceptions; some bars do oﬀer live entertainment, and
some nightclubs do not.
Rural taverns encompass one or two rooms and
do not oﬀer a wide variety of beverages, while upscale urban nightclubs often occupy several ﬂoors
of downtown real estate, serve the rarest vintages,
and treat guests to dazzling ﬂoor shows or performances by famous names in entertainment. To
some, the Roaring ’20s represent the Golden Age of
nightclub success and glamour in the United States,
but this style of business survives today, around the
world. American nightclubs enjoyed a resurgence
in the 1970s, though the traditional “dinner and a
show” has given way to other consumer preferences.
Nightclubs located in former American “sin capitals,” like Atlantic City and Las Vegas, used to showcase chorus lines of scantily clad dancers. Even these
establishments have had to change their line-ups,
and many now oﬀer more family-oriented entertainment. Some are quite elaborate and promise to im-

the upscale nightclub Lucky Sevens, secretly named
for a daring group of seven men (including Mr.
Lindy, then known as “Lucky” Lindy) that pulled

musical and vocal talent available, and it is a favorite nightspot for local mob ﬁgures. It is also a

While the players’ characters visit the club,
whether for a speciﬁc reason or simply to enjoy
some well-deserved rest, someone tries to assassinate a noted crime boss — in the presence of the
characters. Should the characters foil the attempt,
the grateful mob boss lavishes praise and gifts on
his benefactor. Whether accepted or not, these gifts
come with a price, and the player’s character soon
receives a letter from a “dear and respected uncle”
requesting an unwholesome-sounding favor. Failure
to carry out the instructions in the letter leads to a
string of suspicious accidents that plague the characters’ family and friends. The only way to bring an
end to this string of bad luck is to put the mob boss
and his henchmen behind bars. Gamemasters can

throw in a few supernatural practitioners or superscience artifacts to increase the challenge or add
unexpected plot twists.

Casino
Once considered the height of sin and shunned
by so-called proper society, casinos are now seen as a
lawful if not quite yet respectable source of revenue
for many civic entities. They can be found in many
U.S. states, especially on Native American reservations, where the added income is (theoretically, at
any rate) channeled into education and other social
programs. Despite protests to the contrary by local law enforcement oﬃcials, organized crime has a
connection (however distant) to every casino operated outside of the reservations (and probably has a
hand in those, too). Some casinos are dark, dingy,
rather depressing places full of cigarette smoke,
noisy gaming machines, and desperate-looking,
glassy-eyed patrons that mechanically place bets as
if they’ve never known another life. Other casinos
are clean, relatively smoke-free, and achieve at least
the illusion of energy and opportunity with bright
lights and ﬂashing and pinging machines.

A cavern system is a series of interconnected caves
formed from running water or lava ﬂows, often
reaching deep into the earth or side of a mountain.
Cavern systems are the quintessential “dungeon,”
seeing use by humanity over tens of thousands of
years as shelters, places of worship, living quarters,
refuges in time of war and storage areas.
Some caverns are cold, dim and dry, others are
moist or warm, heated by steam funnels or lava
ﬂows. Footing can vary from mildly sloping ﬂoors
(+5 or more to running diﬃculty) to jagged, broken, and twisting with dangerous gaps and pitfalls
(+15 or more to running diﬃculty). Other dangers
include rockslides (Very Diﬃcult Agility or dodge
to get out of the way if the character has warning),
earthquakes (Moderate to Very Diﬃcult acrobatics
or dodge roll to remain standing; +10 or more to
running diﬃculty), stalactites and stalagmites (3D
to 8D damage if impaled upon), steep drops and
pits (1D damage per 1.5 meters over three meters),
and underground rivers or dank pools.
Caverns occasionally supply edible fungus or lichens (Very Diﬃcult survival roll to ﬁnd), ﬂint and
obsidian (Easy survival roll) for ﬁre-starting and
spear-point knapping, fresh water either ﬂowing
or concealed behind a thin wall (Moderate survival
roll), and sometimes supplies of minerals, metals,
or gems (search requires a lot of time and multiple

Located deep within the wilds of a vast jungle,
the Lost Shrine is the stuﬀ of legends. For hundreds
of years, the local tribes have told and retold the

D6 Adventure Locations

Hello, my

story of the Grey Man, whose ashen skin and eyes
of purest black arrived in the jungle during a bleak
drought year in an ancient time.
The Grey Man’s magic was powerful and ﬁerce
— he could cause sickness, famine, and horror
with his rituals. It was said he was so powerful, he
could even use magic in the heat of battle, causing warriors to drop from stopped hearts or burned
minds.
Enslaving the Gintu tribe (the name is only reluctantly revealed by the locals living in the area
now), he cut a swath of tyranny throughout the
region. Legends vary about his motivations: mere
tyranny, an attempt to unite the feuding tribes,
or preparation for resisting an invasion from the
north. Whatever the case, the Grey Man’s arrogance toward the ancestors and gods was eventually his undoing, for more and more rebellion
arose against him. With each atrocity he visited on
the Gintu, their resistance grew more ﬁerce. The
bloodbath continued for many years, yet the Gintu
could never unseat the Grey Man, and their numbers dwindled.
One day, a young warrior suddenly appeared.
His muscled body shone in the sun, his eyes were
clear and bright, and his spear was made of a fallen
star. Legends, unfortunately, say little of the warrior — except that he was not Gintu. The young
warrior’s great skill and weapon deﬁantly pierced
the Grey Man’s defenses, something that had never
happened before.
The Grey Man experienced an emotion he had
never known: fear. Fleeing the burning remains of
the village where the battle took place, he retreated
into the jungle toward a sanctuary – a series of caves
wherein slaves had placed most of his treasures stolen from other tribes, as well as his most powerful
magics. Few knew of the caverns – the slaves who
had worked them were executed after construction.
But somehow, the Sky Warrior (as some legends
name him) found the Grey Man’s redoubt. A ﬁerce
battle took place. The very ground shook; the skies
grey dark, the beasts howled and roared in the jungle. Finally, all was silent. The Sky Warrior appeared
at the mouth of the cave before surviving witnesses,
women from three surrounding tribes.
The Sky Warrior said simply, “It is ﬁnished; the
Grey is defeated.” With that, he shone brighter

The Truth of the Legend
The three tribes can be given as much detail
as necessary to help or hinder the players’ characters. Each of the tribes has their own version
of the legends, often with conﬂicting information. Naturally, tribesmen will be reluctant to
discuss the legends with outsiders, whom they
view with suspicion. One of the tribes may follow a monotheistic religion such as Christianity
or Islam. This tribe considers the Sky Warrior
a holy person of their faith and has modiﬁed
the legends to reﬂect this. Another tribe might
be hostile, driving oﬀ any outsiders. A third
tribe may follow older, matriarchal traditions
and ancestor worship, and they prefer to toy
with visitors or subtly lead them astray. The
jungle near the Lost Shrine (in a valley shaped
like a skull, obviously) may be ﬁlled with color
and serenity or overrun with grey-colored giant
apes, mysteriously friendly black panthers, and
swarms of biting insects. In addition, a more
contemporary setting might have the complications of a modern civil war or famine.
What the Grey Man was depends on the setting. It might have been a demon prince or foul
sorcerer. More intriguingly is the possibility it
was an alien determined to carve out an empire from the primitive peoples it encountered.
In this case, it may have used psionic or other
powers to shape itself (actually or through illusion) as a Human. The Sky Warrior may
have been an angel, good alien, or perhaps the
guardian spirit of a local tribe.

than the midday sun, and vanished. Since then,
the cavern has become a shrine to both the Sky
Warrior and the decimated Gintu. But few venture
past the ﬁrst cave. It is said there is … something
… in the deep caverns. Something cold, inhuman,
and wrong. Of course, that is where the Grey Man
secured his treasure.
The entry to the caverns is well concealed from
view near the surrounding area (Hard search roll),
but it is easy to enter and shows signs of visitors.
Seventy meters inside, is a small shrine cave with

sitting stools, an altar, and various gifts of food and
crafted goods. Torches and candles illuminate the
area. A ﬁve-meter ceiling provides ample room to
move, and a tunnel leads further into the caverns.
The adjacent tunnel runs approximately 33 meters and then takes a sharp drop, bending back upon
itself. The drop can be dangerously slippery, and
stalagmites below could prove a gruesome end. The
tunnel then travels 50 meters further, before opening at a churning pool. This pool of potable water
bubbles and churns due to a pressure diﬀerence between it and the narrow opening at its bottom. The
rock forming the opening is pure granite, and it has
taken millions of years for this hole to form, allowing water to spray down to the next level. Extremely
high moisture and underground runoﬀ from the
daily rainfalls in the region keep a plentiful basin
of water in the pool. At the depths of the pool may
be found several skeletons and their gear – perhaps
victims of one or more of the nastier creatures in
the caverns. Traversing the churning pool requires
a Moderate swimming check. A failure indicates the
swimmer was pulled under. A Critical Failure with
a failure indicates the swimmer was pulled to the

bottom of the pool or was attacked by the ﬂesh-eating ﬁsh that live there.
Once across, the travelers again must navigate
rough tunnels, which abruptly slope downwards.
Foolhardy characters may be in for a surprise, as the
sloping passage is lined with bat guano – making
it very slippery indeed. Those failing a moderate
climbing roll will slide down for a nasty ﬁve-meter
fall in the lowest caverns. In any event, the actions
let loose a swarm of bats (see page 127 of the D6
Adventure Rulebook), which have been altered by
the evil presence of the lower caverns to attack any
intruders to their domain.
After entering in the lower caverns (hopefully by
rope or ladder), the characters may proceed toward
the waterfall cavern to the north or the fungus
chamber to the south.
The fungus chamber is slick with an unusually
acidic fungus (burns for 3D damage every three
rounds, dissolving organic matter; no resistance
roll; may be washed oﬀ). The fungus chamber slopes
slightly inward, making escape diﬃcult. Here rest
more remains of other explorers — although only
their metal weapons and similar tools are seen.

The waterfall room features a broad-spraying,
high-pressure waterfall, fed from the churning pool
above. Here, the heroes will ﬁnd the evidence of
the Grey Man’s existence. The entire room is lit
with eerie fungus as thundering from the waterfall
ﬁlls the air. The noise makes listening and communicating by sound impossible. Staying in the
room for more than ﬁve minutes increases the difﬁculty of all actions by +2 per minute. Staying in
the room for more than 15 minutes may result in
permanent hearing loss (at the gamemaster’s discretion; deafened characters get Hindrance: Hearing
Loss, which aﬀects the gamemaster’s choice of
hearing-related skills). Etched into every surface
are bas relief pictures of the Grey Man destroying
his enemies, enslaving people, and hoarding treasures. Odd and strangely disquieting runes in an
unknown language ﬁll the gaps between the images. The ﬂoors are littered with bones — the remains of the workers who once toiled here and in
the next room.
If characters can penetrate the waterfall spray
(which does 2D+2 damage per round; takes three
rounds to pass through), they ﬁnd a small, wellhewn room. In here are tables and stools of polished stone, rotting tapestries, metal rings along a
wall, and several strange artefacts. Traps and perhaps a dangerous encounter with a magically animated machine or undead minion could occur.
The ﬁnal chamber, the guardian room is a work
of natural beauty. Shimmering gems glint from the
walls (most are ﬂawed and worthless), reﬂecting
dazzling, although oddly, colored light throughout the chamber. Here too, are carvings of ornate
scenes depicting the Grey Man at his power, with

the world bowing down. A 300-kilogram gold idol
of the Grey Man sits on a small mound of skulls. Its
eyes are sapphires, and disturbing runes (that cause
the viewer’s vision to blur) are etched into its base.
It may be a powerful magic or psionic item.
The room is much colder than the other caverns
— supernaturally cold. And something, some …
presence ﬂows from large crags in the northern
facing of the room. Whether the spirit or soul or
psionic resonance of the Grey Man emanates from
that crag is up to the gamemaster based on the setting. In any case, characters may have to ﬁght either the embodied remains of the Grey Man, or
suﬀer mental/spiritual attacks as it tries to destroy
the intruders.

Cemetery
In Western cultures, the dead are most often
buried, but there are alternatives. Some undergo
cremation, while others are enshrouded and placed
in crypts. A relative few are left exposed to the elements, in obeisance to traditions spanning thousands of years, and fewer still are those who undergo preservation (or mummiﬁcation in the Egyptian
style) in order to be put on display, sometimes in
the name of science, sometimes not. A very few
are cryogenically frozen and sealed in large cylinders, awaiting the day that science might ﬁnd a
cure for their various conditions and revive them.
Whichever option chosen, one question remains

to be answered — where do they put the mortal
remains? For most people, the answer can only be:
in a cemetery.
All over the world, people devote land to the dead
and to those who mourn their loss. Such places are
sometimes crassly referred to as boneyards, people
with decorum would name them cemeteries, and
those in between sometimes call them graveyards.
What constitutes a cemetery is mainly semantic:
A single grave may be said to be just that, while
several graves comprise what is quaintly termed a
“family plot” (if the inhumed subjects were related,
that is). Only when two or more graves occupied
by unrelated people exist near each other, a true
cemetery.
Admittedly, this distinction is somewhat blurry.
A so-called mass grave, which contains otherwise
unrelated victims of a terrible crime, is not a cemetery. Instead, it is more properly called a graveyard.
Cemeteries, on the other hand, are parcels of land
devoted exclusively to the perpetual and respectful
celebration of those interred or memorialized within. Here, one is far more likely to encounter only
mourners, groundskeepers, or perhaps, on a really
bad day, gang members shooting at each other during funereal ceremonies for other gang members.
Whatever the term or situation, perhaps on a dark
and stormy night ﬁlled with foul deeds, the living
dead may rise from their graves in search of fresh
brains.

for his self-professed high-ranking membership in
the Poor Fellow Soldiers of the Temple of Christ
of Jerusalem, commonly known as the Knights
Templar. During his last confession, he revealed
that he had discovered the secret of the Censure
Noir d’Troyes, a black-enameled censure presented in the twelfth century as a gift from the Count
of Troyes to his nephew, Sir Hugues de Payens,
founder of the Knights Templar. Sir Hugues presented the censure to the Bishop of Jerusalem upon
entering the city in triumph. Carved from oak and
inlaid with black enamel, the censure had no earthly value beyond its supposed miraculous power
to heal the wounded knights who convalesced in
Outremer’s inﬁrmaries. It was presumed lost after
the Order’s forced dissolution 200 years later, but
tantalizing clues regarding its whereabouts turned
up from time to time, and it has been sought by
Templars ever since.
Charles’ cryptic last words, issued in the presence of family and associates, mentioned the censure and ﬁnished with “take it to your grave, as I
am taking it to mine.” One of Charles’ so-called
business associates, John “Croc” O’Dell (known
as “Uncle Croc” to Charles’ children), interpreted
Charles’s last words as meaning that he had literally
found the relic and was having it entombed with
him in his family’s crypt. Subsequently, O’Dell and
several henchmen broke into Charles’ crypt, and
even searched his house, but to no avail. The relic
appeared lost again, but Croc O’Dell became convinced that it must be hidden somewhere in the
cemetery, so he intends to keep searching even if

he has to dig up every grave in Shady Side (O’Dell
is not squeamish and will not hesitate to resort to
violence to get what he wants). Perhaps the relic is
actually hidden in Shady Side — and perhaps it
possesses mystical powers — or perhaps not ...

City Street
City streets include everything from a dirt road
through a one-horse town all the way up to multiple lane highways ﬁlled with hundreds of pedestrians in a major metropolis.
Old West or even very rural modern city streets
may not be paved, have light posts, or even sidewalks (although wood ones included when the
building was erected are not uncommon).
Modern-day small towns and large cities have a
lot of similar distinctive features on their streets,
including light posts or traﬃc signals on corners, a
public mailbox (usually blue in color), ﬁre hydrants,
street signs, and sometimes parking meters.
In larger cities, telephone and electrical poles
are as all wiring has been shunted underground.
Instead, the average large-city street includes bus
stops (either just a sign or a sign and a covered waiting area), newspaper stands, cart vendors, and, occasionally, raised medians (of concrete or with grass
and trees) to divide the traﬃc lanes.
The smallest hamlets may not even have cars in
them, while small towns may have a few cars and
an occasional person walking the streets. Large cities have hundreds and hundreds of people clogging
sidewalks and creating a virtual wall of bodies when
they all cross the street together. Cars (moving and
parked) may not be a problem on small city streets,
but larger cities have streets more like freeways in
the eyes of pedestrians.
These represent major streets in various locales,
but every city also has back roads and darkened
streets folks don’t walk down at night. These streets
usually have the same signs, light posts (not necessarily working), and other features of a better-traveled street, but they are more run down.

The corner of 63rd and Grand Avenue has seen
better times. Grand used to be a hot spot of the city
with several prominent businesses located here, but
over time, the demographic center of the city shifted to the south of the intersection. Grand slowly
turned into a residential neighborhood.
Now brownstone apartment buildings and small
shops line the blocks along Grand, and those around
63rd street are no diﬀerent. Mr. Voss runs the grocery
store on the corner. Every morning at 6:00 a.m. he
opens his doors and places the crates of fruit outside
his front windows before bringing in the morning
paper. Out front of Voss’ Grocery is the local mailbox, which Katy the Post Lady (as the kids call her)
empties every day at 2:00 P.M. Katy delivers mail for
the entire block and usually stops to talk with Mr.
Voss before returning to the post oﬃce.
Across the street stands Idle’s Coﬀee Hause.
Derrick Idle was a member of a traveling comedy
troupe until his father and mother died in a car accident. He gave up his dreams of stardom to return
home, run the family business, and take care of his

little sister, Josephine. Jo helps out around the shop
and can usually be seen on the weekends serving
coﬀee to the patrons sitting at the three wroughtiron tables on the sidewalk.
Just down from Voss’ Grocery stands the
Norville Retirement Home … well, at least that’s
what Norville calls it. He’s been the landlord of the
brownstone at the center of 63rd and Grand for
the better part of 40 years, and most of his tenants have been around just as long. Now landlord
and residents can be seen sitting on the steps of the
three-story apartment building on warm, sunny
days. Norville and his tenants know everybody on
the block, and nothing slips past their notice.
There are a few cars parked on 63rd and Grand
during the day, but not as many as there are at night
when everyone comes home from work. The local alderman, Russ Feinless (who lives in Norville’s
building), got the city to remove the parking meters,
allowing the people living here to park freely and not
worry about ﬁnes. The whole block shut down and
had a big party the day they were removed.
A four-sided three-light traﬃc signal hangs from
wires in the center of the intersection of 63rd and
Grand. Traﬃc used to be such that a ﬁve-light sig-

nal was being considered, but with the exodus of
businesses, the locals decided it wasn’t necessary.
Light posts stand on opposite corners of 63rd
and Grand with one more in the center of the
block. This one is a new addition, as the residents
felt the blocks were a little too dark at night.

Things to See
 Red stop signs and green or white street signs
 Post box (blue for outgoing; green for the

 Streetlights oﬀering ﬂuorescent orange or

Convenience Store
Convenience stores are small shops, usually positioned along busy roads or intersections. Most
convenience stores also sell fuel for vehicles, and
the convenience store sales supplement the primary
income provided by gasoline. Convenience stores
sell various goods and services, often unessential:
newspapers and magazines; lottery tickets; drinks,
such as soda, water, juices, and beer; light groceries, such as cereal, canned goods, eggs, and milk;
money orders; toiletries and pharmaceuticals (painkillers, cold medicine, and so on); and car materials, such as maps and oil. They also oﬀer junk food
(chips, candy, and the like) and sometimes real food
(hotdogs, wrapped sandwiches, or even a small deli

or hot bar). One
hallmark of modern
convenience stores
is the “slushie” machine — a rotating
tumbler that freezes
ﬂavored water into

a snow-like drink.
Convenience stores have reasonable daytime
shopping hours, and many are open 24 hours (although even the all-night locations have locks on
the doors). Gas stations are very safety conscious:
Most have security cameras and mirrors (Easy security to bypass), and aisles generally do not extend
above 1.5 meters to ensure the clerk has extensive
visibility. Most stores do not keep large sums of
money, and larger store chains have automated
time-lock safes to ensure money is unavailable.
The ﬁrst convenience store in the United States
opened in 1927. They can exist any time after that,
more or less unchanged from the modern counterpart. In an alternate world or steampunk universe,
convenience stores might have a diﬀerent feel, perhaps combining a tea bar with a “general store” of
barrels with dry goods and hardware. In near-future
settings they will sell appropriate refueling (such as
hydrogen cell recharges), and the ATM or other
modern features will be replaced with overpriced
futuristic electronic services (such as an InfoNet
station or scholarchip uploader). Regardless of the
era, however, all convenience stores of a region
should feel similar and oﬀer the same type of goods
and services.

Tyler “Ty” Gassen founded the Gas’n Go six
years ago with a simple philosophy: Provide quality
fuel and goods for motorists at reasonable prices in
a professional environment. Unfortunately, he has
had a slight problem realizing this dream. Although
no more or less strategically placed than any of the
other convenience stores in town (of which there
are many), the Gas’n Go has nevertheless become
the nexus for an improbable amount of unusual
activity. To date, the Gas’n Go has been the site of
(among other events) 16 attempted robberies, ﬁve

tornados, three ﬁres, two hostage situations, and an
incident involving a Yakuza member getting shot in
the head, which sent his vehicle careening into the
store. Fortunately, Ty’s great luck tends to counteract his phenomenal bad luck, so he usually ends up
roughly back where he started, talking to reporters, sweeping up debris, or hiding the mysterious
manila envelope from the Yakuza’s car. Because of
an obscure state loophole, the Gas’n Go’s insurance can’t be raised or cancelled unless the entire
building is destroyed ... which hasn’t happened yet.
Ty is excellent at sizing up a person’s desires and
motivations, and he generally helps good folks in
bad situations as best he can, by hiding them in the
storeroom or oﬃce, giving them fuel or goods, or
providing a distraction. However, he doesn’t fancy
himself a hero and will not risk his life needlessly.
Ty prides himself on a well-stocked and diverse
shop. In addition to common brands, he also stocks
obscure and regional candies, beer, and cigarettes;
he sells diesel fuel, and his magazine racks have
comics. He also keeps a surprising number of odds
and ends in his groceries and general merchandise
sections
(treat
availability as being equal to a grocery store for most
items, with +1 to
the diﬃculty of any
Funds checks because of increased
overhead). Ty also
keeps a sawed-oﬀ
shotgun (damage
6D; ammo 2) under the register, a
schnauzer named
Killer in the storeroom, and silent
alarm buttons by
the counter and in
his oﬃce that alert
the police; unfortunately, given the
nature of the Gas’n
Go,
authorities
take an inordinate
amount of time to

arrive. His oﬃce contains a decoy safe (Moderate
lockpicking to open) hidden behind a painting of
dogs playing poker; it contains a few hundred dollars and a cheap gold chain. His real safe is hidden
behind the hinged slushie machine (Diﬃcult search
to ﬁnd; Very Diﬃcult lockpicking to open). In addition to money and important documents, the safe
contains all the unusual doodads and knickknacks
he has accumulated from his store’s incidents.
The Gas’n Go is open from 7:00 A.M. through
11:00 P.M., seven days a week, 365 days a year. The
store has a massive turnover rate in employees, although one recent hire, Almira Klakshae, has stuck
around for six months and seems made of sterner
stuﬀ.

Of the many modern structures in existence, few
are as specialized yet utilitarian as the convention
center. Even the earliest designs were enormous
structures, sometimes created for one-use purposes
such as a world’s fair. Designed to host commercial activity, the convention center often serves the
same function as the trade fairs of ancient times,
when merchant caravans would assemble in large
ﬁelds outside a nearby city to trade among themselves and the inhabitants of surrounding areas.
In size, the modern convention center (from the
1940s and onward) can range from a small facility
of thousands of square meters to enormous “cities
within cities” of multi-level structures miles across.
Such behemoths have their own power plants, attached hotels, gigantic docking areas, and operations centers. Often, convention centers are divid-

Convention Center

26

D6 Adventure Locations

ed into halls, each capable of hosting a trade show
or convention simultaneously.
Usually, except for late at night, convention centers bustle with nonstop activity. Convention centers run on a cycle known as setup-show-teardown,
in which exhibitors’ freight and personnel arrive to
ready for a convention, then hold then show, and
ﬁnally pack it all up for a return home or travel
to the next convention. The halls are rarely empty,
instead being ﬁlled with (at minimum) tables and
chairs, but more often with curtained dividers between spaces, which are ﬁlled with tables, chairs, or
elaborate displays of wares (including signs, samples, and salespeople).
A ﬁreﬁght within a convention center can be a
dangerous proposition. Most cover provided by
display booths and signs is concealment only – bullets and energy beams can blow through such objects. Visual distance is limited — mostly to the
long axis of the series of aisles that run the length
of the convention ﬂoor between booth spaces. The
shorter aisles often stop or bend or are choked with
packing materials during setup or people during a
show.
Of course, ﬁghting during a show will result in
mass collateral damage to people and property, and
it can create a panic that could lead to more deaths
as people shove and trample each other to make it
to the distant exits.
Depending on the show, there may be some hard
cover and potential weapons. An industrial machine
show would provide solid hiding space behind large
machining centers or robots, while a military show
could have combat machines, drones, and robots.
These industrial devices might emit mild EM signatures and a lot of heat, fouling infrared and other
combat sensors.
Police and ﬁreﬁghters can be expected to respond
en masses to reports of ﬁres or combat at a convention center. After all, such places may be one of
the crown jewels of a city and its reputation – it
wouldn’t help the city to have its visitors mowed
down. Modern convention centers are well built
to avoid problems with ﬁres and the like. Many
convention centers also feature a small ﬁre-ﬁghting force and somewhat underwhelming security
guards. But actual combat can easily overwhelm
architectural design safety standards.

Some numbers that might be helpful: the size of
a booth space (3 by 3 meters to 15 by 15 meters,
usually averaging US$150 or Easy Funds roll per
square meter at today’s rates); height of ceilings (10
to 20 meters); number of people on a ﬂoor at a
medium-size convention (5,000 to 10,000); time
to get service from a vendor (30 minutes to an hour
or more); noise level (rock-concert during setup,
much less during a show unless a lot of machinery
is being run).
Noncombat complications include surly union
workers (bribery is possible, but modern contracts
tend to outlaw such activity), crabby customers,
giant bureaucratic maze of forms and procedures
(despite this most conventions are astonishingly
well-organized), high-speed load lifters racing to
and fro, too much heat (despite huge volumes,
most convention centers get sweaty-hot during
setup), lost freight, and ridiculously high charges
for sandwiches (US$10), cold water (US$3) and
electricians (US$60 per 20 minutes).

Don’t Miss ...
The Burnside Convention Center is hub of
economic activity in a typical medium-sized city.
Unknown to residents and most of the workers, the
center was built on an extradimensional gateway
node. Unfortunately, this node leads to some rather
nasty infernal regions populated by an assortment
of evil beings.
Once every three months, the dimensional barrier weakens, allowing access to Earth via the node.
Fortunately for its inhabitants, the area around the
node is sealed with another magical barrier that
prevents infernal access to outside the convention
center grounds. Those “in the know” can spot the
edge of this barrier (Moderate divination or Very
Diﬃcult search roll) — its ﬂowers, plants, and other
outdoor accents burst with life and vigor — much
to the puzzled pleasure of the groundskeepers.
When the node opens each third month, the
denizens of these infernal regions set up a little trade
show of their own. The various demons, devils, and
vile spirits set up hideous booths – displaying their
evil and vile wares and services and vying for contracts for souls, infernal hit jobs, and the like. The

D6 Adventure Locations

27

Hello, my
name is...

convention starts at midnight and lasts three hours.
At the end of the three hours, everything is sucked
back into the node in a furious hellstorm.
Evil human sorcerers and their ilk know of the
convention center and eagerly await its arrival.
There, they can sample the wares from the infernal
planes, pay to learn new sorceries and corruptions,
and bargain for their souls or the sacriﬁces they
make of unwitting victims.
Secrecy, of course, is paramount to the operation. In a somewhat “realistic” world, there may be
divine rules at work specifying that normal people
cannot ﬁnd evidence of the supernatural … or else.
In a more cinematic game, the convention center
owner takes great measures to keep the general
public unaware to prevent troubleshooters from
crashing the event.
The owner of the convention center, James
Balthazor, participates in the Convention from
Hell and is well paid to make sure absolutely no
one is around during the event unless they have a
special ticket to attend. He carefully uses bribery,
blackmail, and mind-aﬀecting sorcery to ensure the
privacy of the event. (Players’ characters may need
to overcome such spells to enter the grounds, usually Moderate to Very diﬃcult willpower tasks).
The players’ characters become aware of the
Convention from Hell in one of a variety of ways.
Perhaps the characters are accidentally mailed a

28

D6 Adventure Locations

ticket after subscribing to an occult magazine.
Perhaps Balthazor’s headstrong daughter insists on
going to the show, thinking her father is merely
up to some illegal activity and the characters are
contracted to restrain or rescue her. Or, maybe the
characters are tasked to follow a necromancer bent
on bringing his latest captive to the convention to
trade for a Zombie-creating spell.
If played as a humorous scenario, the gamemaster should stress the absurdity of the show — little
demons running around setting up booth walls,
rigging lighting, ﬁne-tuning torture racks and like.
Vendor demons dressed like used car salespersons
pester the visitors with special show-only oﬀers
and one-time deals. The characters might even witness a group of devils getting into a brawl with the
Union of Infernal Heat Producers and Distributors
(IHP&D) reps.
In a serious scenario, the entire atmosphere is
very deadly: the characters must constantly be on
the lookout for aggressive foes seeking an advantage and must “act the part” of evildoers (Moderate
to Diﬃcult con and disguise rolls are appropriate,
as is liberal use of intimidation). One slip and they
could (literally) bring Hell down on their heads.
The booth sections will feature a litany of abhorrence the likes of which mere mortals have a hard
time adjusting to – gamemasters should play up the
gore, fear, and hopelessness on display. If the heroes

are here to rescue someone, they had better ﬁgure
out a way to frame a group of infernals for their
deeds — a common enough practice for these beings. Once the ﬁreworks begin, they can hopefully
escape with their captive.

Things to Do
 An acquaintance of the players’ character calls and, in a worried voice, says no one has
seen her nephew since he attended the last trade
show. The nephew was hired by the acquaintance’s
company to set up and tear-down the booth. The
company sells some kind of exotic or military technology: high-capacity storage, cutting edge optics,
laser systems, or early nanotechnology.
Oddly, the corporate reps at the show were reportedly from one of the company’s “black” divisions,
engaged in some top-secret work. Supposedly, they
were to meet with very select clients at the show. The
characters are asked to look into the nephew’s disappearance, as the police have turned up nothing.

Dock Front
The dock front emerged from a simple yet ancient
problem: How do you connect ships and their stuﬀ
to dry land as eﬃciently as possible? The dock front
provides a centralized location for ships to launch

D6 Adventure Locations

29

Hello, my
name is...

and land, load and unload cargo, and manage their
legal and bureaucratic aﬀairs.
The most prominent feature of a dock front is its
docks — the straight physical platforms that provide a means of landing and launching vehicles. In
times of old, these were made almost exclusively of
wood, while most large modern docks are usually
metal and concrete, especially those designed for
huge ocean liners, oil tankers, or freighters.
Docks have several features, the extent of which
depends on their size. First, docks exist primarily to
handle cargo; as such, roads, warehouses, cranes, and
lots of burly people are nearby to get goods oﬀ and
on a ship. The oﬃces and employees necessary to
keep track of these shipments are also usually nearby.
These buildings are almost always nondescript and
Spartan; the sea air plays havoc with any ornamentation, and docks do not depend on foot traﬃc.
Second, dock fronts exist as a means of permitting and organizing aquatic excursions. In olden
times (pulp-era and before), one-way ship-bound
travel was much more attractive, but today’s luxury
liners and yachts primarily give their occupants a
chance to enjoy the sea, depositing its passengers

30

D6 Adventure Locations

in the same spot they left. These often use the same
docks as the cargo vessels, though private docks for
the rich are common. Regardless, these areas are
often rigged to provide a bit more comfort for passengers, usually with benches, bars, and sometimes
duty-free shops.
Finally, most large docks have a governmental
authority or liaison to ensure that all security, legal, and tax issues are resolved. The Port Authority
wields supreme authority in its domain, and it can
ban certain vessels or shippers, or even restrict or
close the entire dock. In eras where terrorism is an
immediate threat, security systems are much more
omnipresent, requiring a Diﬃcult con, security, or
sneak check to circumvent. In other eras, docks are
much more relaxed and usually the point of entry
or egress for criminals, undesirables, or others who
exist outside the law; at most a Moderate check is
necessary, and most docks are Easy to get into. Of
course, these diﬃculties do not assume the possibility of having help, such as a corrupt insider; such
aid would make things much easier.
The dock can exist in almost any era virtually untouched. Any changes would be cosmetic and behind

the scenes — inventory controlled by clipboards instead of computers, cranes powered by people instead of diesel, and so on. Likewise the dock front
scales trivially to diﬀerent sizes; two or three docks
mean the area can handle at most dozens of ships a
day, while hundreds of docks in various sizes mean
that thousands of vessels can come and go.

Don’t Miss ...
The Midton Harbor was ﬁrst so dubbed in 1877
and has grown steadily — and proﬁtably — ever
since. After the recession of the early 1980s, most
of the dock was taken over by investors Dale and
Douglas O’Dare. Twin brothers, these 50-year-olds
have kept the docks running in full order for decades. Unfortunately, they are at moral extremes;
Douglas has made all manner of shady deals and
illegal operations, ensuring the docks’ continued
contributions to the city’s ﬂow of contraband and
other ills. Dale O’Dare, the altruistic multimillionaire, continues to run the dock for all manner of
humane purposes and is unaware of his brother’s
misdeeds ... or of the fact that Douglas often impersonates Dale to further his own goals.
The bulk of the harbor’s commercial docks are allocated according to vessel size and tradition; ﬁshing vessels traditionally use the crane docks to unload, then trade and sell their wares at Fisherman’s
Wharf. Mundane docks are numbered, giving them
a speciﬁc address. Freighters not requiring a crane
generally unload on Tillard’s Wharf (named for a
regional Civil War hero), while smaller vessels generally use the mini-docks; in particular, Douglas
has used the docks between Tillard’s Wharf and
Holder’s Marina for illegal activity.
The Port Authority was traditionally weak at
Midton Harbor, but recent terrorist events have
bolstered its budget and power. Nyokabi Bira, the
33-year-old Kenyan immigrant who heads the
Authority, has begun all manner of investigations
and increased counterterrorism measures. Her
mandate also extends to the Midton Ferry, which
transports thousands of passengers daily and is a
security nightmare.
Outside of the Port Authority, Holder’s Marina is
the only property of note not owned by the O’Dares.

These docks harbor the most expensive ships of the
city’s elite. Cardamom Holder, the beautiful 27-yearold socialite who inherited the legal rights to the marina, has proven surprisingly curious and competent
in the day-to-day aﬀairs of Midton Harbor. Some
in the know think this gray-eyed ﬁrebrand has her
sights on taking control of more of the harbor ...
although whether this is for common good or her
own desires is unknown. She spends her spare at the
Norse Yacht Club, where nautically minded millionaires pass their days in its opulence.

Farm
The family farm is one of the classic American
settings in ﬁction depicted with sentimental aura
of naiveté, an iconic example of wholesome family values. This upright persona of clean living is
precisely the reason the setting of the farm is excellent for twisting into the fabric of a good adventure. Whether it involves a busload of teenagers
being stalked by a psychopathic killer or a façade
masking the secret base of a super genius bent on
world domination, the benign and deceivingly boring country farm can hold many surprises. Even
in a more family-oriented adventure, it is a good
stalking ground for a talking animal and its crimeﬁghting buddies.
A key aspect of using the farm to host a scenario
is the remoteness of the location. Especially in campaigns set in the early or pre-industrial eras, farms
are generally isolated. While a few are a couple of
hours’ walking distance from a small town, most
farms are generally only close to other farms. Even
in a modern setting the phone and power lines in
this rural location are rarely underground, making them easy to severe to prevent characters from
sending for reinforcements. Roads leading to farms
are usually small one-lane dirt tracks during the
pre-World War II era, and in modern times they
are the very same roads with a (sometimes disintegrating) coat of asphalt. Sabotage of a vehicle or
inclement weather can make escape from the area
diﬃcult, perhaps impossible, forcing characters to
take shelter in the structures available.
Additionally the ﬁelds can be vast, almost mazelike obstacles to wander around in. During the day,
players wandering ﬁelds of taller crops, such as corn
or sugarcane, can loose their sense of direction and
may require Easy to Moderate search and navigation rolls to get their bearings. At night, not having
the sun and view of tall landmarks, these checks
become much more challenging, adding +10 to
the daytime diﬃculty If pursuing someone into, or
through, a ﬁeld of tall crops the person being chased

gains a +2D bonus to hide and sneak attempts made
within the ﬁeld. Shorter crops, like soybeans or
wheat, can provide some cover to those lying down
or perhaps crouching, but the bonus is only +1D
and is lost when the person moves. Searching for
someone moving through a ﬁeld from an elevated
position or while ﬂying may negate all, or part, of
these bonuses.
Another phenomenon of ﬁelds, good for exploiting in adventures, is the crop-circle. These are
clearings, within the ﬁeld, that form patterns when
viewed from the air. These patterns can be intricate,
revealing pictures or complex icons. Crop-circles
are made by placing a stake in the ground, attaching a rope to the stake, and leveling the crops with
the rope by walking around in various patterns. It
is a prank played on farmers, locals, and conspiracy theorists to make them believe aliens or other
supernatural forces have visited the ﬁeld and left
their mark — perhaps even a message. Obviously,
for adventurers, encountering the real thing rather
than practical jokers is a distinct possibility.
In the realm of mundane encounters, characters may run afoul of the farmer, his or her family,

farmhands, crop pickers, or livestock — including
cows, horses, pigs, chickens, as well as dogs and cats
commonly kept for security and pest control. If a
call for help was made, the response of local law enforcement might be a semi-skilled deputy or fairly
competent sheriﬀ. In Wild West campaigns, this
might be a problem as practiced gun-ﬁghters often
took jobs as law-enforcers.
Most locals will treat outsiders with caution and
mistrust, giving a +5 to +10 modiﬁer to all interaction attempts made against them. In some cases,
when trouble is rumored throughout the area, the
barrel of a shotgun might greet those approaching
a farm rather than just a deaf ear. However, an injured character would likely be taken in and aided,
giving the player a chance to interact and bond
with the wary farm family. Of course, with the values of rural areas generally being more conservative, attention paid to a farmer’s daughter might
be treated with more scrutiny and maybe even a
shotgun wedding!
Generally, a farm consists of one house, a barn,
one or two silos (or other storage structure), with
a single road running to the house and bracketed

Farm Hazards
Should a character be run down by a farm
vehicle with one of the various attachments or
harvesters in use, add another 3D to the collision damage. Falling, or being thrown, into
a thresher, mower, plow, harrow, cultivator, or
similar device operating but stationary does 6D
damage, however this damage is only applied
to the limb or limbs that get trapped inside.
Being buried inside a silo could easily prove
fatal to anyone trapped inside. If buried far
down inside the building, the character must
make a Very Diﬃcult climbing test to wade
through one meter of the crop surrounding
him. Critical failure with a failure results in
4D+2 of damage, unless the character has some
way to protect himself from the weight of the
crops such as an environmental suit, forceﬁeld,
or special regenerative ability. Every few climbing tests necessitates a stamina starting at Very
Easy, increasing by +5 per check, and counting
as an action, unless the character stops moving.
A Critical Failure with a failure deals 5D+2 due
to suﬀocation, but general failure prevents the
character from continuing for 2D minutes. The
character trapped inside automatically take 5D
damage for every 15 minutes spent buried.
by ﬁelds. The position of the house, relative to
the ﬁelds, varies and is often based on geographic
boundaries or land ownership. In modern settings,
parcels of land are generally bordered by one- and
two-lane asphalt roads to allow tractors and trucks
easy access to the crops. Drainage ditches almost always separate the road and the crops. A few farms,
orchards, or plantations have stables or dairies;
however, the barn normally suﬃces for the basic
needs of storing livestock.
Typical farmhouses generally have two to four
bedrooms, a kitchen and dining room combined,
a pantry, a living room, and porch suitable for seating several people. On a plantation, the main house
can be quite ostentatious with four to 12 bedrooms,
a study or library, a sitting room, a dining room,
a separate kitchen, and perhaps even a ballroom.

34

D6 Adventure Locations

Additionally servants (or slaves in some eras) quarters may be nearby; the design and quality generally
reﬂect the owner’s philosophy and means. The area
around the main house, barn, and other central
structures usually has 10 to 20 meters of clearance
from the ﬁelds or orchards.
Dairy farms have one or more large, oblong
structures that have stalls for milking. The cows
generally graze in pastures surrounding the dairy
and are brought in twice a day for milking. In more
high-production, corporation-owned facilities, the
cows remain in the stalls the entire day and are
milked automatically up to four times a day. Dairy
cows are accustomed to the presence of people and
normally ignore most intruders, retreating from
anything threatening. Cows do sleep upright and,
for reasons only known to the inebriated mind, tipping then over while slumbering is a semi-popular,
though sometimes dangerous and diﬃcult, rural
activity. Once tipped, a cow can right itself, albeit
clumsily, but heavily fattened cows may not be able
to do it without intervention.
Barns are tall structures, generally ﬁve to eight
meters, with a large open area on the ﬁrst ﬂoor and
loft above. On the main ﬂoor are the livestock, or
in more modern settings the tractors and combines. The loft is generally additional storage, speciﬁcally for feed, such as seed and hay. In the barn
are generally found the most lethal instruments on
the farm, aside from a riﬂe or shotgun the farmer
would have in the main house. These objects include pitchforks, scythes, saws, machetes, knives,
axes, and most any kind of power or manual tool.
Aside from an ornery horse or bull, these instruments generally make the barn the most dangerous
building for players to enter on a dark and stormy
night.
Vehicles common to modern farmers include a
tractor, combine, and a pick-up truck. During harvest, a 10-wheel truck may be rented to haul crops,
but trailers for the same purpose can be added to
any of the common vehicles. The tractor is used
for tilling soil and planting seed, using a variety of
attachments that it tows. Combines mow through
ﬁelds and separate the crop from the stalks. Being
run down by a combine or tractor can do severe
damage to a character, as the blades and other instruments can rend ﬂesh quite easily.

Tractors and combines can range in scale from 6
to 12 with a Toughness of 3D to 5D. They rarely
can move better than 20 kilometers per hour (28
meters per round), and in a ﬁeld, they can only do
half that speed.
Silos and other storage facilities for grain, corn,
soybeans, and other crops vary depending on the
type of crop. A silo is generally around ﬁve to 12
meters tall four to six meters in diameter, and holds
about 10,500 to 2,500 liters (300 to 700 bushels)
of crop per meter height of the silo depending on
diameter. Modern silos have a vent going down
one side of the silo from top to bottom, for climate
control, and this might make a convenient escape
hatch for characters trapped inside.

Things to See
 Large tubular or small square bales of hay
 Farming implements (pitch forks, shovels,
spades, hoes, wide brooms, water hoses, etc.)
 Hard, thick disk-like patties of animal
manure
 Large bags or barrels of plant fertilizer
 Large bags or barrels of animal feed
 Long wooden, plastic, or metal troughs to

 See the “Apartment” and “House” entries for
ideas on what appears in the farmhouse

People to Meet
Most farmers have 2D in most attributes (possibly 3D in Coordination and Physique), with lifting at +1D to +2D due to the hard physical labor
they go through. The farmer is skilled in scholar:
agriculture or a similar skill at +2D to +3D, plus
repair and business skills of +1D to +2D. Farmers in
Wild West and frontiers campaigns, or others with
more intensive environments, also have a combat
skill such as marksmanship or melee combat at 3D to

5D. Family members generally have 1D to 2D+2
in attributes, depending on age, plus skills similar to the farmer, though generally at lesser values.
Horses, dogs, and cats can be found on page 127
of the D6 Adventure Rulebook. For a quick encounter, consider horses, cows, bulls, buﬀalo, llamas,
and similar large animals to be scale 2 to 4 with
Physique, brawling, and running skills of 4D. Give a
+1D damage bonus for hooves and horns and +2D
damage bonus for trampling.

Things to Do
 A group of players’ characters, weary from
travel, spy a barn in the distance and approach to
ﬁnd shelter for the night. As they draw closer, a
shot rings out, dirt kicking up nearby, and a husky
voice shouts, “Get oﬀ of my land!” Looking at one
another, the characters must decide if they can reason with this man or if the next farmhouse might
be a bit more hospitable. Of course the sun is starting to go down…
 Barreling down a country road, the players’
characters race to elude a ruthless hit-man when they
careen oﬀ into a ditch. Seeking cover, they run into a
ﬁeld only to ﬁnd that the hit-man has killed the local
farmer and stolen his combine. Turning the machine
toward the characters, he drives at them intent on a
messy end for the heroes. Should they head for the
road or try to elude him in the ﬁelds?
 A close relative of one of the players’ characters has invited the party to stay on her farm in
order to “get away from it all.” In the middle of the
night, phantom voices can be heard coming from
the barn, drawing the characters out of the relative
safety of the house into the yard. Perhaps the cropcircles, gruesome cattle mutilations, and suspicious
deaths of the past few days weren’t so coincidental

riﬂemen in dispersed patterns or even those readying for melee combat. The trees tend to disperse
neat formations, however, perfect for some defenders looking to lure
highly disciplined
units into personal
combat. Of course,
those formations
may simply wait in
the meadow and
pepper their enemy with missile ﬁre in the hopes of driving them
into the open (see the movie Gladiator for a scene
where a Roman army ﬂushes barbarians from the
woods).
Natural dangers include ﬂash ﬂoods (as water
from higher elevations will take the path of least
resistance and ﬂow through a meadow), dangerous
weather, grass ﬁres in dry seasons, forest ﬁres, and
animal or stinging insect attacks.
Very generally, the meadow provides no cover
unless it is rolling or somewhat hilly. Tall grasses
and old logs may provide decent concealment (+6
cover modiﬁer). The forest’s trees average scale 8 (as
large as scale 20 for some old-growth trees), with
Toughness ranging from 2D to 8D and providing full cover to beings of Human size or smaller.
(Some large trees oﬀer greater protection to bigger
characters.) Of course, unless there has been wet
weather, forests are easily lit on ﬁre due to the plentiful supply of dry underbrush, twigs, and the like.

Forest and Meadow
The forest and meadow might seem like an unusual place for adventure and danger. The words
bring to mind the images of bucolic places ranging from the glens in Sleeping Beauty to the alpine
meadows in The Sound of Music. But remember the
forest and meadow (an interface zone between two
vastly diﬀerent kinds of terrain) is one of the most
common areas in the natural world, and much possibility arises.
Depending on the climate and current weather
conditions, the forest and meadow may be a warm,
inviting place to sleep, harvest natural materials
and set up camp, or a cold and barren place beset
by snow or rain, with the possible presence of enemies hidden in the tree line.
A prime location for camping, the forest and
meadow makes an ideal spot with open terrain
to erect tents and graze animals with a plentiful
supply of wood for ﬁres and structure building.
Survival rolls receive a +5 or higher bonus during
warm seasons, and cold weather has little penalty
(if the camper is properly prepared). Finding food
is an Easy to Moderate survival task (again depending on season), with often hunting and ﬁshing opportunities plentiful.
Establishing a line of defense just inside a forest overlooking a meadow can net several powerful advantages as the trees provide signiﬁcant cover
and concealment for the defenders who overlook
the open area. Of course, if the defenders are taking artillery ﬁre from cannons, this cover may be
somewhat negligible as shells hitting the trees will
spray wood splinters and blown-oﬀ sections upon
defenders (watch the movie Band of Brothers to see
the eﬀects of modern artillery on an entrenched
unit in a forest), causing 1D or more in damage. In
less modern settings, tree lines can provide cover for

The woods surrounding the Forked Glen meadow are thick and heavy, full of old logs and dense
undergrowth, which cut travel speed by 75%. Thus,
the only real option is to stay on the two trails that
enter the glen. From the west, the trail cuts directly
to the heart of the area, with the remains of a campﬁre nearby. (Depending on how soon after the previous occupants left that the new visitors arrive, the
characters might be able to make an investigation
or survival roll to determine when the ﬁre was put
out. The further in the past it was created, the more
diﬃcult the character has in ﬁguring out when
the campﬁre was extinguished.) Under one of the

campﬁre rocks is concealed a small weapon
or clue.
The meadow itself
has tall grasses, providing easy concealment
for a lurking enemy.
The nearby pool is
surprisingly deep and
cold, and it could serve
as the sight of a drowning or hiding place for
an aquatic enemy.
The north most
trail enters over a ford,
which features mossslimed stones and a
potentially nasty fall
when crossing (+10 to
running diﬃculty; 3D
damage from fall if the
character fails the roll
with a Critical Failure
and loses his next few
actions getting out of the stream). The stream that
exits from a dark, dank cave nearby feeds the steam
and the pool.

Things to See
 Sticks that wind has ripped oﬀ of trees, ranging from hand-length twigs to arm-length branches
 Bushes ﬁlled with berries (poisonous red or
white baneberry or daphene or red chokeberry; edible blueberries, raspberries, or thimbleberries; etc.)
 Clumps of poison ivy, identiﬁed by its oddly
shaped, ﬁve-lobed leaves (+5 to all diﬃculties for
1D days if a character touches the plant; increase
the diﬃculty modiﬁer and length of time for prolonged exposure)
 Moss-covered rocks
 Animal footprints
 Tall grass in an open meadow
 Thick, spongy blanket of fallen leaves or needles within a forest
 Acorns, chestnuts, or pinecones scattered
underfoot

People to Meet
Most commonly, characters won’t meet anyone
in a forest or meadow. Rather, they’ll run across
squirrels, chipmunks, mice, and birds, with the occasional fox, deer, wolf, bear, or mountain lion. Use
the game characteristics for rats (under the “Cavern”
entry) for small animals; the game characteristics for
horses (page 127 of the D6 Adventure Rulebook) for
deer, the game characteristics for dogs (page 127 of
the D6 Adventure Rulebook) for wolves and foxes,
and the game characteristics of large cats (page 127
of the D6 Adventure Rulebook) for mountain lions.

A Sense of Serenity
Gamemasters can rely on forest and meadow
areas to lure players into complacency if the
area is described as peaceable and inviting. But
perhaps the entire meadow houses the underground presence of a carnivorous fungal colony
that beguiles its prey with psychedelic spores?
Perhaps a section of the tree line is actually a
carefully camouﬂaged bunker complex that
the characters blithely walk toward as machine
guns track their approach? Maybe strange
magic is at play, and the meadow touches other
realities, other places — changing the air, water, soil and animals to something else.

say a good-night prayer to Mr. Frost. The characters
then must learn the dark ghost story of Mr. Frost

sorrow and revenge. Can the characters uncover
the truth about Mr. Frost? Or will the townsfolk’s

Throughout history, travelers often had to rely
upon the kindness of strangers, but sometimes they
found temporary shelter from the elements in inns,
establishments designed especially for pilgrims and
similarly transient visitors. Some inns oﬀered little
more than a dry piece of dirt to lie down upon
(modern-day “fare-saver” motels seem to have embraced this lamentable tradition). A few inns provided for every comfort, but they charged increased
fees for doing so. Thanks to Hollywood, many people think that inns were a ﬁxture of ancient and
medieval life, but the truth is that, throughout his-

tory, relatively few people have ever been permitted
to travel very far from the place of their births, and
inns weren’t as ubiquitous as mass-market ﬁction
would lead people to believe. For example, the inns
of the Roman cursus publicus, the famous system
of imperial roads, could only be used by military
personnel and government couriers with special
permits. Conditions were not much diﬀerent in
medieval Europe, as travelers other than merchants
(and sometimes even them) were looked upon with
suspicion. Only when the world grew much safer
did anything resembling the modern concept of
inns, motels, and hotels come into being.
Some motels simply oﬀer a clean bed, working
bathroom, and cable television, amenities they deliver with reasonable success. Hotels in major cities
sometimes incorporate themes, in much the same
manner as casinos, in order to attract customers.
In places like Las Vegas, and in resorts around the
world, it can be hard to diﬀerentiate between hotels, casinos, and nightclubs: The concept have often been merged, to keep patrons coming through
the door and staying longer.

Things to See

 Johnny DeSoto, a jazz trumpet player from a
popular club in San Francisco, is on the run. Rumor
has it that he got a little rough with someone else’s
sweetheart and left town before her corpse was discovered. At this point, the police only seek him for
questioning. Miles away, the players’ characters have
come to the Westmarck Hotel to investigate a string
of attacks on local women, all of whom have dark
hair and share the distinction of having attended a
jazz performance at the Westmarck. Tonight the case
became a murder investigation — one of the players’
characters discovered the body of a city councilman’s
wife in the back row of the hotel’s nightclub during a jazz performance. The murdered woman, who
also had dark hair, was apparently bitten in the neck
by something with powerful jaws, and much of her
blood had been drained. Another player’s character
recognizes the jazz band’s trumpet player as Johnny
DeSoto, having seen his picture in the papers a few
days ago in relation to the crimes in San Francisco.
If approached, Johnny willingly answers questions.
He believes he is not guilty of any crime, but he
admits that he has been suﬀering severe headaches
and periods of amnesia ever since a bad car accident
several months ago. If confronted by the police, or
if the police are mentioned, he will not submit to
captivity, and instead attempts to ﬂee. Catching him
proves to be quite a task, as he seems to be endowed
with superhuman strength and agility, leading one
to suspect if he really is innocent after all…

Things to Do

House
Houses, much like apartments, vary mostly in
number of bedrooms and overall size. Unlike apartments, which normally stick to a “kitchen, bath,
dining room, living room” motif, houses may have
an assorted number of other rooms, many connected by hallways. These could include den, family
room, great room, sitting room, solarium, nursery,
utility room, laundry room, pantry, foyer, closets,
storage rooms, attic, and washrooms, among others.
Also unlike apartments, houses will generally
(though not universally) have basements. Houses
with basements usually have the washer and dryer
located here, as well as the furnace, water heater,
and sump pump. Some basements are ﬁnished
with carpets, paneling, extra lighting, and a variety
of other interior decorating items to make it usable
as any other room in the house.

Houses can be anywhere from one story (a
“ranch” house) to two or three stories and beyond.
Anything above three stories is uncommon and
would be best quantiﬁed under mansion instead of
just a house.
Upper most house levels are almost invariably
used as attics. Sometimes attics are in crawl spaces
above the uppermost level of a house, other times
they are just another room on a top level.
With houses come external features, including a
yard (including trees and bushes), attached or freestanding garage, storage shed, or even a barn for
farmhouses. These features vary depending on the
location of the house. A country farmhouse may
have a huge yard with a stand of trees, a barn, a
garage, and several other buildings. On the other
hand, a house in the suburbs of a major city may
have a miniscule yard and a single one-car garage as
its sole amount of external property.

dining room, living room, family room, full basement, and two-car garage on a half-acre plot. The
well-kept lawn has ﬂower beds and bushes edging
the building.
The three bedrooms are on the upper level. The
master bedroom is the largest, with two other
smaller rooms of roughly equal size. Each bedroom
has a closet. The full bathroom on the upper level
has a sink, toilet, and clawed tub with shower. The
hall closet has ample for storage.
The house’s front door opens onto a large living
room with a coat closet. The stairway to the upper
level starts here. Through the door on the opposite
end of the living room is a pantry area with small
utility closet, kitchen with bar to the left, and halfbath (sink, toilet, and closet), and doorway to the
lower level.
The U-shaped kitchen has a stove, sink, and ample cupboard and counter space. A small bar looks
out over the dining area between the kitchen and
family room. The dining area has a counter running
along the right side with a small closet at its end.
There is a railing separating it and the family room
and a small step down between the two rooms.
Slightly smaller than the living room, the family
room looks out onto the back patio. It has a small
closet just inside the back door.
The lower level of the house consists of a full basement. Unﬁnished, it has a cement ﬂoor and block
walls. The washer and dryer are along the back
wall, and a previous owner’s workbench stands in
a corner. Running along the ceiling are steel support girders, while three evenly spaced steel poles
bisect the room the long way. The light switch in
the stairwell turns on the light in the stairwell itself,
the other basement light ﬁxtures have strings hanging down that operate them.
Just behind the house is a cement patio running
the length of the house to the blacktop driveway.
The backyard extends from the patio some distance
before ending at a chain link fence determining the
property line.
The garage has a built in garage door opener and
rafters easily usable for storage. While not large
enough for a workbench along the side or in front
of most parked cars, there is enough room within
the garage for storage of bikes and other items.

Things to Do
 The characters are visiting a friends’ house for
a summer barbecue and house-warming party. This
is the ﬁrst time they have been here, so the new
homeowners are pleased to show them around. In
the midst of the festivities, a squad car arrives and
a police oﬃcer comes to the door. He’s looking for
one of the neighbors attending the party and arrests
him on the spot. The characters are too faraway to
hear the charges, but they do notice the oﬃcer’s
partner looks a little nervous as he sits in the car
and keeps pulling on his uniform collar as if he isn’t
used to wearing it.

The other key feature of an island stronghold is its
isolation. Large cities frown upon people performing chemical tests or other potentially dangerous
research within their limits. But on a remote island,
no one can stop you from detonating your latest
chemical weapon to test its results. And no one can
hear the screams of your victims, as you watch to see
exactly how the gas eﬀects them. Likewise, no one
will see the young millionaire arriving on his yacht
and then watch the masked crusader departing in
his sleek jet, and realize that they are the same person. Island strongholds are wonderful repositories,
because whatever happens in them, no one outside
will ever know the truth.
The speciﬁc island stronghold has two key basic
features: the island itself and the stronghold’s main
purpose Some islands are mere rocks, with dark
slabs of stone rising toward a single imposing summit, and even sea
birds don’t bother to
stop there. Others
are paradises, with
smooth
beaches,
palm trees, and
pleasant weather.
Still others are more
ice than rock, whipped constantly by arctic winds
that can ﬂay the ﬂesh from a person in an instant.
Or, the island could be an active volcano, regularly
oozing lava that streams down the island from its
smoking peak, destroying all in its path.
Strongholds can serve a variety of purposes. It
could be a laboratory where new weapons and
chemicals are tested. In a strategic location, it
could house troops and ships, which are prepared
for launch upon unsuspecting targets. It could be
a prison, set well away from the world so that its
inmates can never escape to wreak havoc again. An
otherwise inhospitable jut of rock could become
the home of a mining operation that carves deep
into the Earth to rip free her treasures.
Not all strongholds are sinister. Some are designed for protection, solitude, or even entertainment. An enormous hotel, the only building upon
a small tropical island, counts as an island stronghold. So does a corporate headquarters, where
employees can work undistracted by the normal

Island Stronghold
The island stronghold is a mainstay of action
stories and pulp adventures. Villains often own an
entire island, its exact location unknown to any but
the villain’s closest associates, and there he plots on
how to take over the world. On the other hand, heroes sometimes have such locations as well, and use
them as retreats, safehouses, and training grounds.
The best thing about an island stronghold is its
dominance. Often the island is so small or so uninhabited that it has no other structures beyond
the stronghold. This is particularly true of inhospitable rocks chosen for their defensibility and
perhaps their natural resources. Even on inhabited
islands, the stronghold is the largest and most wellconstructed building. This means that the stronghold’s owner dominates the island in general and
can control the activities of its other occupants. It
is diﬃcult to sneak up on someone who owns an
island stronghold, knows every islander by name
and face, and has them trained to report intruders
immediately.

chaos of a city. Similarly a massive keep, designed
to protect the island natives from tropical storms
and raiders alike, is also a stronghold.
Most island strongholds share only three features. First, they sit upon an island and are the largest single structure on that island. Second, they can
hold a sizable number of people — usually at least
three dozen and often in the hundreds. Third, they
are fortiﬁed in some way and exist the strongest
structure on the island. This may mean they have
thick stone walls, they have cutting-edge security
systems, or the stronghold’s foundations are cut
into the island’s bedrock, so that the fortress cannot
be blown away by the annual monsoons.
Some strongholds are carefully concealed within
the trees or the rocks. Others stand out in the open
for all to see. It might be built from native materials, and made to look like it belongs there, or it
could be a gleaming ediﬁce of concrete and glass
and steel. It could have an ultra-modern appearance, or something more gothic.
Island strongholds should always be a mystery for
the players. Even if the location is well-known, the
stronghold’s exact layout and purpose may not be.

44

D6 Adventure Locations

The brochures claim it is a hotel, but why doesn’t
it show up on any sea charts, and why does the
plane have no windows for the passengers? Island
strongholds present a chance to get away from
the normal world, and that also means a chance
to set aside standard plots. If the characters have
been dealing with realistic crime scenarios thus
far, the island stronghold can be a chance to throw
something more otherworldly at them, or at least
more spooky. Even the most mundane items and
events can seem magical on a deserted island, and
old sailors’ tales are ﬁlled with stories of monsters
that were probably just wild boars and other native
animals. But the island gives gamemasters a chance
to shake things up a bit and to make the players’
characters reassess what they know and what they
think they know. It also gives everyone a chance to
cut loose — whatever the characters see and do on
the island, the details may never leave its shores, so
they can act without their usual restraints.
Beyond location and purpose, the features of the
stronghold vary. There is always some way of getting to the island, whether by submarine, boat, or
airplane. Sometimes the dock or landing pad is vis-

ible, when the owners care little for secrecy, while
other structures may have a hangar door that opens
in the fortress so that the vehicle can slide inside
safely.
Inside, the stronghold could be palatial, businesslike, or spartan. Some owners might prefer to have
their guests lounge on oversized pillows and piles of
rugs, sit on elegant couches, or rest on rough-hewn
wooden benches.
The owner might go so far as to dictate the type
of garments employees (and perhaps even visitors!)
may wear. Such apparel might include jumpsuits,
lab coats, army fatigues, business suits, or togas.
Similarly, if there’s a theme, the security guards
would carry weapons appropriate for the period
being mimicked.

The island retreat of Jafal Kwan, the multibillionaire industrialist and would-be world dictator,
is a massive, fortress-like building, with three levels.
The ﬁrst ﬂoor is mainly antechamber, plus dining
room, kitchen, meeting rooms, and Kwan’s private oﬃce. The second ﬂoor has guest rooms and a
small library. The third ﬂoor houses the staﬀ (in a
series of small bedrooms and, for the guards, a barracks) and has Kwan’s private suite at one end. The
master suite has a bedroom, a small living room,
and a private bathroom. The stronghold also has
a basement, which houses the laboratories and
storerooms. Kwan selected this island location for
its remoteness and the fact that absolutely nothing
lives upon it. The island is simply a massive rock
spire, and the stronghold has been carved into that
— from some angles the stronghold looks like just
another group of rocky outcroppings, though from
other vantages its steel girders and large windows
are easily visible. The stronghold is ugly and rough
on the outside but beautiful inside, more like a resort hotel than a fortress, with beautiful paintings,
marble ﬂoors, rich rugs and tapestries, and elegant
furniture. A single skylight at the center of the
stronghold allows the sunlight to strike a massive
faceted crystal chandelier, which sends beams of
light glittering throughout the room. On the roof
of the stronghold is a helipad, and in its base is a

small harbor for speedboats. These are the only two
ways to enter the building.

 A unique machine has been stolen. Only a
few people even knew of its existence, and it has
never been fully tested — but if it works, it could
give a single individual the power to stop an army.
Clues point to an island stronghold and its owner.
Now the characters have to ﬁgure out how to get in
there, ﬁnd the device (if it really is there), recover it,
and get back out again safely.
 The characters have booked a holiday retreat
at this island getaway. The location is remote, the
island is beautiful, and the accommodations are
superb. Everything is wonderful, and it is shaping
up to be the best vacation ever — until one of the
other guests goes missing, and the hotel’s owner
starts acting strange. Is there trouble in paradise?
And if so, should the characters get involved, or
just go back to enjoying themselves?

Laboratory
The word “laboratory” often conjures up images
of strange chemicals bubbling through mazes of
glass and tubes, or tests conducted on machinery of
such complexity that even its creators cannot fully
understand what they have designed. Many labs
actually possess few chemicals and do not contain
any equipment more complicated than a personal
computer. They can focus on a variety of ﬁelds,
including avionics, biochemistry, chemicals, electronics, the environment, genetics, medicine, nuclear and alternate forms of energy, physics, sewage
treatment, and others. Which ﬁeld and whether it
focuses on research or development dictates how
the laboratory will be stocked. (Thus, the “Things
to See” list may not be appropriate for many circumstances, as it focuses on chemical- or physicsrelated ﬁelds.
Gamemasters can nonetheless use the stereotypical think-tanks as the scene of heroic and dangerous showdowns with the forces of evil. Winding

corridors; rooms packed with tubes and chemicals or wires and electrical sensors; roaming security guards, and distracted scientists and engineers
— while far from reality — make for exciting confrontations in the laboratories of mad scientists,
paramilitary special weapon design houses, or clandestine corporate or government medical research
facilities, where all manners of potential hazards exist to hinder or assist the players’ characters.

This secret underground lab complex has only
two entrances above ground, disguised as nondescript white sheds located in one corner of a military airﬁeld. Nobody pays them any attention, and
no one questions the occasional foot traﬃc near
the structures. Elevators within the sheds drop well
over 50 meters below the surface, opening into an
ordinary-looking oﬃce, much like
any other located in a typical urban
area, attended by a friendly receptionist. Trespassers are politely but
ﬁrmly asked to leave, and security
guards can be summoned at the tap
of a button located on the ﬂoor beneath the receptionist’s desk.
Beyond the reception area lies another, larger
oﬃce accommodating several company executives
involved in the facility’s projects. This oﬃce is further subdivided by partitions into cubicles for various white-collar oﬃcials and supervising scientists.
Two doors lead out of this room: one to a nearby
underground housing and recreation complex, the
other to the facility’s three main laboratories.
The ﬁrst lab is lined with lockers and refrigerators contain traditional lab supplies: stock chemicals and biological agents; spare glassware and parts,
and emergency medical equipment. The center of
the room is ﬁlled with rows of tables bearing complicated arrangements of beakers, Bunsen burners,
rubber tubes, and test tube racks.
The second lab is marked by a single large device of unknown manufacture and purpose, which
stands in the middle of the ﬂoor. Power conduits
and probe cables lead to the device from a variety
of panels and monitoring devices, some of which

stand on a heavy table nearby. The device has no
identiﬁable markings, and appears as if it were of
unearthly manufacture, but closer inspection reveals that some integrated parts, at least, were indeed made here on Earth. This is still not enough
evidence to deﬁnitively place the device’s point of
origin, though, and says nothing about its purpose
other than that it uses electricity. A short passage
leads to a small side room with copper mesh and
lead panels on the walls. A bulletproof window,
overlooking the enigmatic device in the next room,
is near a desk that has a network port and docking
station for a personal computer. Pens, paper, and a
scientiﬁc calculator are in the single drawer, and a
telephone sits next to the computer.
The third lab is predominately ﬁlled with large
animal cages holding dozens of animal specimens,
mostly dogs and baboons. These cages are stacked
three high and line every available square inch of
wall space. Two rows of desks occupy the middle
of the ﬂoor, each with its own computer docking
port, telephone, and drawers full of oﬃce supplies.
Scattered throughout the three main facilities are
restrooms, clothing and equipment lockers, and
storerooms ﬁlled with sundry supplies.

 The military had just ﬁnished primary trials of a hybrid animal species intended for special
ops, but the program proved too successful, and
the creature broke out of its cage. It is now hiding
somewhere in the underground facility, and it has
so far injured seven security guards foolish enough
to block its path. The creature is well equipped to
kill, thanks to its altered physiology, and top execs fear that it might escape from the compound,
since on-site security forces are not up to the task
of capturing it. If the creature does escape, they fear
it might interbreed with one of its “parent” races
(such as, Canis familiaris — the common dog) and
create super oﬀspring that would pose a tremendous threat to local citizens. The players’ characters
might ﬁnd themselves embroiled in this event for
any number of reasons: Perhaps one is related to a
lab employee, thus giving the character a personal

48

D6 Adventure Locations

stake in the mission. Alternatively, maybe a character owes one of the project’s scientists a big favor.
The creature’s exact skills and abilities depend on
the nature of the campaign and the relative abilities
of the players’ characters, but it should be dangerous. The creature’s motivations are equally mysterious — is the creature a bloodthirsty beast intent
on killing everyone in its path, or is it a semi-intelligent and self-aware victim of cruel experiments,
simply trying to escape torture at the hands of soulless researchers?

Library
“Libraries,” in the sense of “places of knowledge
and information hoarding,” have existed since the
Sumerians of the third millennium, B.C.E. In fact,
explorers sometimes stumble across these ancient
troves of lore, their dusty pages kept as secreted
away as they were back then. However, the concept
of “library” as “site of publicly available information” is a much more recent development: In the
United States, Andrew Carnegie’s library construction project from 1883 to 1929 was revolutionary.
Before then, libraries had closed stacks; you needed
to ask a librarian for a speciﬁc book, who would
go get it for you. The Carnegie libraries had open
stacks; patrons could peruse the collection and
picked ones based on what seemed interesting.
Today most libraries are open-stack, although
various organizational systems — such as the Dewey
Decimal or Library of Congress Classiﬁcations —
enable people to ﬁnd books on topics they want
(Easy to Moderate investigation roll to ﬁnd a book,
depending on how obscure; if the topic is not represented by the classiﬁcation system, or the book
has been omitted for some reason, a Moderate to
Diﬃcult search check of the books themselves is required, along with the time needed to look at the
publications).
Although libraries primarily dealt in books and periodicals, the library system reinvented itself a couple
of decades ago, expanding into media (CDs, video

tapes, computer software, and DVDs) and, for many
communities, computer and Internet access. Some
authorities worry that these public-access computers
provide untraceable access for nefarious hackers, but
information specialists believe using them in that
way is challenging (+6 to tech checks for computer
attacks originating from public terminals). Libraries
can also refer to any specialized collection of texts,
or contain those texts as a special collection; these
collections are not necessarily public access, and may
require Contacts (rank 3 or greater, depending on
value of information) to access. However, the lore
these restricted stacks can share may be phenomenal
(providing +6 or more to certain scholar specializations, and possibly Magic or Psionics skills).
Libraries would be mostly unchanged throughout most D6 Adventure settings, although settings
prior to 1980 or so would be limited to books and
periodicals. Pre-Carnegie researchers would need to
endure the closed stack system — and the resultant
charm, con, or persuasion rolls necessary to obtain
books from librarians — as would researchers at
many university libraries, regardless of the era.

Don’t Miss ...
The Collin-LeRoy Library, opened in 1973, is
one of a few libraries in town. It provides books

on a number of subjects, although popular ﬁction,
nonﬁction, and self-help remain their biggest collections. Its open stacks, like most public libraries,
use the Dewey Decimal Classiﬁcation. It provides
public access to computers and most media types
(including media readers), and its newspaper collection covers community events for the past 200
years, although many patrons are confounded by
the microﬁche readers necessary to access that information. Due to tight budgets, it is open 11:00
A.M. through 5:00 P.M. Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday, and 2:00 P.M. through 8:00 P.M. Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday; it is closed on Sunday.
Despite the limited resources, the library does
what it can for the community, including afterschool reading programs, book clubs, and literacy
programs. It also strives to provide access to information, even if it doesn’t have it immediately: It
boasts that their interlibrary loan system can acquire 95% of all books published in the last 200
years if given enough time (traditionally three
months, although sometimes longer).
Those who wish to borrow materials need to provide a license and proof of local residency, and there
is a checkout limit of six of any one media type
(books, tapes, DVDs, etc.) at a time. The library
also has a gift shop that sells inexpensive wares and
donated materials (Very Easy Funds roll for most
materials).

Hello, my

The head librarian since the library opened, 77year-old Dr. Claire Spade, is surprisingly spry for
her age, and enthusiastically helps those seeking
knowledge (providing +4 to assisted scholar and
investigation: research checks). However, the CollinLeRoy Library has a secret cache of books and materials. Dr. Spade knows what subjects they cover,
obviously, but she claims them to be a closed stack
and refuses to permit anyone to access them unless
they provide a speciﬁc title request. To date, no one
is known to have done so correctly. The mystery of
these books, and what topics they cover, remain one
of the most closely guarded secrets of the library;
their room has a Very Diﬃcult security system (in
stark contrast to the Easy systems of the rest of the
library) and video surveillance. Those who know
Dr. Spade believe she is guarding this information
for good reasons, although they are usually at a loss
for what those reasons could be. They also worry
what will happen when the day comes where Dr.
Spade will need to retire ... or what would result if
something happened to her before then.

Things to Do
 Before she died, an eccentric multimillionaire
had accumulated the world’s largest collection of
books and documents on a speciﬁc topic (Zombies,
apocalyptic legends, otherworldly ailments, etc.). It’s
now vital the players’ characters ﬁnd this information ... and fast! Can they decipher her library’s obscure organizational system before it’s too late, without accidentally stumbling across any additional
Information People Weren’t Meant to Know?
 The library has been a ﬁxture in town for
over a century and is a cultural landmark. So when
the players’ characters notice it’s on ﬁre, they may
feel compelled to save this piece of history ... not to
mention the irreplaceable lore that would be lost if
they fail to act. And was its ﬁre an accident, or did
an arsonist have more sinister plans?

Mall
The ﬁrst indoor mall began operation in 1954.
Prior to that, shopping locales primarily remained
in downtown areas; stores opened to people oﬀ the
street, encouraging them to see product, come in,
and shop. The mall reversed this idea. Rather than
exposing its stores and product outward, hoping to
entice would-be shoppers to stumble into them, it
turned its stores inward, creating a shopping experience free of distractions like road traﬃc and
weather. It didn’t matter that people couldn’t see
the smaller shops from the outside; people would
be drawn to the mall simply for the promise of
pleasurable shopping.
This innovative idea — coupled with a 1954 tax
law change that encouraged mall construction —
led to a retail revolution. Soon malls were popping
up everywhere in the burgeoning suburbia, and
within a few short years the downtown retail centers had dried up or transformed. Eventually, the
mall paved the way for huge specialization stores
(focused on electronics, auto parts, home furnishings, or the like) and gargantuan one-stop retail
outlets, which continue to dominate the retail
landscape today.
Indoor malls have several deﬁning characteristics, all of which contributed to their success. First,
all malls have at least one — and often two or
more — “anchor” department stores. These large
retailers oﬀer a wide range of goods, although almost all of them devote a large amount of space to
women’s apparel, jewelry, cosmetics, and the like.
What other products they include depends on the
store’s focus and atmosphere. For example, an upscale fashion department store may have nothing
but the ﬁnest clothing with the latest fashions and
the trendiest makeup, while a general-purpose, “Ato-Z” shop might oﬀer a smattering of everything,
from hardware and electronics to clothing and toys
... although none of it would past muster at a debutante ball. Many general-purpose department stores
also oﬀer services, such as photography studios,

optometry, hairstyling, or tuxedo rental. Anchor
department stores are the key to the theory of the
mall, since they enable smaller shops to “share the
wealth” of the larger magnet stores.
Second, many malls are two-story buildings. This
enables shoppers to park at one end of the mall, see
all the shops on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, go up via escalator
and see the second ﬂoor shops, then back down
another escalator, ending their circuit back where
they parked.
Third, malls tend to have atrocious parking,
making it diﬃcult to drive in or out, or otherwise maneuver eﬃciently. This isn’t by design, but
rather seems to be a side eﬀect of poor planning;
considerable eﬀort and expense go into designing
the mall building itself, while parking becomes an
afterthought. As a result, any piloting stunts or maneuvers more diﬃcult than mundane driving and
parking have their diﬃculty increased by at least

Strip Malls
Strip malls are actually older than traditional malls, with some pegging their origination
in 1922. Most of the information regarding
regular malls applies to them: They exist to
draw people in to one or more magnet shops
(often a grocery store), and they oﬀer a variety
of retail locations. However, they generally do
not have the regulations of malls and usually
do not require the same level of proﬁtability.
Thus goods and services that couldn’t be justiﬁed in a mall — dry cleaning, used book
stores, drug stores, and the like — are common in strip malls. Since they are open to the
world and not air conditioned, they do not
generally have food courts, although most
have one or more restaurants.
To simulate a strip mall with the accompanying map, simply cut oﬀ a handy block
of shops and assume the rest is sidewalks and
parking. For example, Turow’s along with
shops 1 to 4 and 49 to 52 would make a
good small shopping center, while adding 36
to 48 and even 30 to 35 would make a truly
grandiose strip mall.

+3 and up to +6 for truly atrocious parking lots at
summer sidewalk and holiday sales times.
Finally, malls almost always have a ﬁrm set of
rules and regulations for their retailers. These include codes of cleanliness, required hours of operation, directives toward merchandising displays and
signage, and so on. Although these do not have a
direct impact on shoppers (beyond generally being
designed to provide the best shopping experience
possible), these regulations can be used by someone who makes a business or scholar: law roll (ranging from Very Diﬃcult for established, disciplined
stores to Moderate for mom-and-pop operations)
to ﬁnd something wrong. This information can be
used to get the store in trouble with mall authorities (usually a large ﬁne) or as leverage to get the
store to provide a favor.
Beyond the department stores, malls oﬀer a
myriad of shops and services. Most stores tend to
be targeted toward a speciﬁc demographic, such as
“trendy teenagers,” “plus-sized women,” “yuppies
who cook,” and so on. However, stores that are too
specialized often cannot survive, unless proﬁt margins are good; a shop that specializes in imported

52

D6 Adventure Locations

Asian art and statues may ﬁnd the markup suﬃcient despite a small audience, while comic shops
have a notoriously diﬃcult time making enough
money in malls.
Most malls also have a food court, specializing in
quick food to sate shopper’s appetites and alleviate
them from the need to leave the building to eat.
Food courts are a relatively recent phenomenon,
the ﬁrst one having opened in 1971. In 1976, the
ﬁrst pushcarts and kiosks in the center areas were
introduced, to oﬀer truly specialized, targeted, or
seasonal merchandise.
With only a few improvements, malls have remained pretty much the same for half a century.
Certain types of specialty stores have come and
gone — today, cell phone shops are omnipresent
while tobacco places are rare — but the basic feel
and air-conditioned atmosphere are identical.
Historically speaking, malls cannot exist any
time prior to 1954. In fact, their very spirit is an
antithesis of many earlier genres; the suburban,
“anything-for-sale” atmosphere of a mall stands in
stark contrast to a pulp-era’s “make do with what
you’ve got” cosmopolitan mindset. Nevertheless, it

is possible to adapt this location for some genres.
The single-ﬂoor mall pictured is actually not too
dissimilar to the old bazaar; simply replace the
rigid walls with less-deﬁned boundaries of people
oﬀering wares, and change the shops to something
appropriate to the time and place: For example, 8Track’s Music would be a musical instrument vendor, while Rembrandt’s Razors and Blades would
specialize in edged weapons and tools. In addition,
there would be no large department stores; instead,
that entire area of the bazaar wold be dived or it
might all belong to one person, such as the mysterious Mr. Copperhoﬀ. However, a bazaar with large
single-vendor areas would be out of place in most
historical European or American settings, and it
should be reserved for more exotic locales.
In the near future, malls will probably continue
to play an important part in commerce; shops and
services will change to reﬂect this era’s interests, so
that a world where e-books have taken oﬀ might
ﬁnd the mall’s bookshops replaced with stores
selling digital book readers and books on disks or
mini-drives. It’s also possible that some innovation might inﬁltrate near-future retail techniques,
such as holographic displays at the stores’ edges or
beamed cell-phone text messages advertising deals
and specials.

Don’t Miss ...
The People’s Mall opened in 1956 amid the wave
of mall construction, and it remains the only one still
in business of the eight malls opened in the area from
1955 to 1965. It, too, had its share of ﬁnancial diﬃculties, and during the recession of the late 1970s, it
seemed doomed to closure as well. However, it was
revitalized in 1980 by Helen Duckworth, a frankspeaking ﬁnancier with a vision and a plan. To entice shops back into the mall — where, by that time,
only nine had remained open — she gave them the
option of staying rent-free in exchange for a reasonable percentage of proﬁts; if they proved to be suﬃciently proﬁtable, they could switch to a traditional
rent structure at any time. In other words, there was
no risk to the retailers. This unorthodox approach
drew in dozens of new shops, many of which were
experimental or unconventional. Some failed, but

many did achieve proﬁtability and revitalized both

Today, Duckworth Mall (as it was renamed in
1995) remains a strong force in the area. Although
not the largest mall, its retailers and patrons are generally dedicated. However, recently it has come under
assault from Internet retailers; the 2000 Christmas
was its worst in two decades. Although sales have
picked up, Mrs. Duckworth, now 57 years old, still
feels pressure to reinvigorate the mall yet again.

The Stores of the Mall
Unless otherwise noted, ﬁnding goods in these
stores will vary, depending on how speciﬁc the need
is and how compatible the store is with those needs.
This can range from Automatic (ﬁnding sneakers in
Sportsfeet Center) to Easy (ﬁnding a trench coat
capable of concealing a shotgun at Jacket-on-theCheap) to Diﬃcult (ﬁnding apparel suitable for a
wedding at EdgEtc. Gothwear) to Very Diﬃcult
or above (ﬁnding an out-of-print book with a
necessary counter-ritual at J.P. Bibliophile). Some
tasks should be impossible to even roll, if there’s
absolutely no chance a store would carry it (such
as arcane Japanese ritual accoutrements from
Transistorland). What skill is used to ﬁnd items
can vary, although search, persuasion, business, and
scholar: malls can all be useful. Prices are rated by

diﬃculties in parentheses; see the sidebar for an explanation, and see the “Equipment” chapter of the
D6 Adventure Rulebook for the game mechanics of
price diﬃculties.

Department Stores
Turow’s and Copperhoﬀ are the mall’s two department stores. Turow’s focuses on middle-class
clothing, cosmetics, furnishing, electronics, and
durable goods (E to M for most items), while
Copperhoﬀ deals exclusively in upper-middleclass clothes, makeup, jewelry, and other wearables
(most items E to D, with +2 diﬃculty modiﬁer for
Funds rolls compared to a similar item at Turow’s).

Apparel and Shoes
Like most malls, there are more clothing shops
than any other types (not counting eateries), and
they continue to be the most proﬁtable of the nondepartment store retailers.
Hot Heels remains the only dedicated women’s
shoe store in the mall (not counting Women’s
Sportsfeet and the department stores). They specialize in alluring but comfortable women’s shoes,
including their own “Hot Heels” brand of highheel shoes for active people (no running penalty
for wearing them). The store manager is Eliza
Hawking, a 33-year-old snob. All shoes are fairly
expensive (E).
Skinny-Phat Gear specializes in hip urban
clothes, and the associates can dress someone appropriately for social functions. This can range
from a kickin’ outﬁt (E; no out-of-place penalty to
disguise or social rolls in urban situations) to a complete urbanite wardrobe (M; +1 to same rolls). The
business is run by Jamila Jackson and her husband,
Shawn.
2Kewl Clothing and DNA Jeans are basically
the same store, specializing in teen and collegiate
fashions (though 2Kewl also markets heavily to
preteens). All prices are reasonable (VE to E),
though DNA Jeans’ price diﬃculties are +1 since
it’s trendier. Both stores are run by a rotating crop
of bored 20-somethings.
Dressed to the Nines Formalwear rents and
sells tuxedos. Rentals are aﬀordable (E per day, M

per week), while outright purchases are pricey (D).
Tuxedos can supply up to +2 bonus in glitzy social situations. The shop is run by Charles Stevens,
an 87-year-old man who was here when the mall
opened (“Back when it was called ‘Dressed to the
Sixes,’ ” he jokes).
Rubenesque Beautywear specializes in plussized women’s wear (E) that accentuates larger
beauty. It’s run by Holly Alamin, “39 and holding,”
who’s also a client.
Jacket-on-the-Cheap specializes in all kinds of
jackets (snow, leather, rain, trench coats, etc.) and is
run by Dag Dolby, a quiet 54-year-old veteran. All
cloth and fabric coats from the “Protective Gear”
table on page 114 of the D6 Adventure Rulebook
are here at their list prices, except Kevlar (VD) and
Flak jackets (D), which he keeps in the back. Dag
also has a dozen guns and other weapons in his
back oﬃce, in direct violation of mall rules.
Apparel Magniﬁque has the most beautiful and
expensive clothes in the mall (D; +2 to social rolls
where fashion would matter). It’s run by 61-yearold Edna Stoles, a words-can-kill socialite with an
icy demeanor and an annual facelift.
Lace Conﬁdence, run by the perky 28-year-old
Suzanne Hilles, specializes in beautiful but expensive intimate apparel (E). It also boasts more mirrors
and mannequins than any other shop in the mall.
EdgEtc. Gothwear is a shop devoted to alternative and underground lifestyles, mostly revolving
around the color black. Shirts with bleak-but-funny sayings (“Hi! Kill me before I kill you!”), piercing apparel, handcuﬀs, and things with chains and
spikes (improvised weaponry up to 1D+1) are all
common; prices are all very reasonable (VE to E).
It’s run by wry 31-year-old Taki Nakamaru, whose
intimacy with alternative and street lifestyles could
make her a valuable contact.

Electronics
Transistorland is an anachronism, specializing
in small parts and electronics bits in an era where
most folks simply buy new gear when necessary.
Still, just about any electrical or computer component can be purchased here, along with simple electronic gear (portable radios, tape recorders, etc.)
at the prices listed on the D6 Adventure Rulebook

“Gear” table on page 113. It’s run by 42-year-old
Adam Barry, a depressed man who hates his job.
Home Audio Maestros specializes in home theatre systems, televisions, car stereos, and other large
electronic entertainment equipment. Although
equipment costs more than normal (+2 to standard
prices), the manager, 36-year-old Darrow Stacey, is
very knowledgeable (+2 to tech rolls for purchasing
the right gear).

Be Sure to Stop by
the Food Court for a
Delicious Snack!

Food
The food court was added in 1974, and it has
grown into one of the more proﬁtable areas of the
mall, despite food being cheap (VE). Unless speciﬁed, all employees are the faceless teenagers and
20-somethings.
Mex-To-Go, Sandwichman, World’s Best
Burgers, and Big Chicken Little’s are all chain
fast-food shops.
Chopstick House, Pita Packers, and Anita
Gyro all oﬀer vaguely ethnic food that’s generally
healthier than the fast-food alternatives.
Skipper’s Island Grill is the eatery of choice for
many mallrats, despite the absence of neon and
chrome like the more well-funded places. Shaka
“Skipper” Marlee, 31 years old, cooks up wonderful Caribbean food. The jerk chicken is a specialty,
although long-time fans warn to go easy on the
supplied cups of jerk sauce; it could cause blindness if thrown in someone’s eyes!
Original Cinnamon, Smoothie Lovers, Pretzel
Pretzel, and Cookies For Dinner! are all set up
like traditional over-the-counter eateries, yet oﬀer
specialized foods ... most of which wouldn’t qualify
as complete meals (except some of the smoothies).
Anyone who decides to eat a completely unhealthy
meal needs to make an Easy stamina roll or be at -1
to all totals until a real meal is eaten.
Deathbed Confections and Carol’s Coﬀee are
two specialty shops customers enter. The former
oﬀers chocolates and candy, while the latter oﬀers
ground, whole-bean, and fresh-brewed coﬀee. The
amiable Carole Cassidy, 37, actually owns both,
and she is also a master chef.
Coast-to-Coast American Grill is the only
“real” restaurant at the mall, providing sit-down
service in a festive atmosphere. It oﬀers American

cuisine. It also has a full bar of alcoholic beverages,
which none of the other eateries have.

Games and Hobbies
All these shops are run by 20- and 30-somethings
with a passion for their subject.
8-Track’s Music, Admit One Video,
Powergamer’s Edge, and T*O*Y*S specialize
in music; DVDs and movie paraphernalia; video
game hardware plus computer and video games;
and toys. T*O*Y*S has very little variety (specializing in current “hot” toys and games), but the other
three shops have a wide range. In a pinch, a computer guru could rig the video game systems into
something useful (+4 to tech diﬃculties).
The Option Vueplex 10 is a 10-screen movie
theater that usually devotes most of its screens to
the latest big-budget blockbuster (VE per ticket).

D6 Adventure Locations

55

Hello, my
name is...

However, one small screen — dubbed the “dorkatorium” by workers — is devoted to “art ﬁlms” and
other lesser works.

Gifts, Cards, and Books
J.P. Bibliophile, a chain bookstore run by 59year-old Cal Hite, specializes in popular ﬁction and
nonﬁction, advice, and bestsellers. However, it also
tries to keep at least one of a book on almost any
subject, giving the store remarkable breadth if not
depth.
Trinity Books and Gifts is a religious shop with
aﬀordable oﬀerings (VE to E) both mundane and
unusual: Bibles, crosses, plaques, and the like. The
proprietor, 24-year-old Mary Reed, is truly devout
and will help those in need ... especially if the situation involves the sinisterly supernatural.
Finest Figurines, “Because I Care” Cards, and
Momily Gifts all specialize in gifts, cards, ornaments, knickknacks, and the like. “Because I Care”
is a chain, and fairly lifeless. Momily Gifts consists
entirely of homemade wares created by 41-yearold mother Gwenda Gerdiven. Finest Figurines,
the most expensive, has many goods involving the
phrase “gold-inlayed.”

Jewelry
Elna Silver & Gold and Crown Jewelry both
oﬀer ﬁne jewelry. Elna Silver & Gold is the more
personable and aﬀordable (E to D); the owner, 51-

year-old Elna Crux, believes in selling the right
jewelry over the most proﬁtable. Elna also likes to
help people and won’t bat an eye for unusual or
custom needs. Crown Jewelry is a chain shop, and
its managers are very skilled at selling its beautiful,
but more expensive, jewelry (M to VD); they are
much less helpful.

Services
Hour-Sight Optometry provides standard optometry needs (E to M) and can make a limited
selection of cosmetic glasses or contact lenses in a
hurry.
Mega Spiﬀ Hair & Nails provides excellent, if
expensive (E), haircuts, colorings, perms, manicures, and pedicures. If need be, the salon’s services
can be used to provide up to +3 to disguise totals.

Specialty Shops
Candle Princess and Magniﬁscent Perfume are
chain stores that both sell somewhat expensive (E)
candles and perfumes, respectively.
Whoopie’s Novelties sells mundane and adult
novelty items (VE to E), including ﬂash paper,
electronic recorders, and itching powder, while
The Compleat Gadgeteer oﬀers overpriced gizmos (E to M) that serve a variety of less-than-essential needs (massagers, air puriﬁers, etc.). Both
chain stores are a gadgeteer’s heaven, as many of
the items can be incorporated into other plans (up

to +3 to tech, con, or know-how rolls, depending on
creativity).
It’s Just a Buck! is a chain dollar store. Almost
any everyday thing can be found, dirt-cheap (VE).
However, the quality often leaves something to be
desired.
Shutterbug Essentials sells cameras (traditional
and computer), ﬁlm, lenses, accessories, and so
on, at the prices listed on the “Gear” table on page
114 of the D6 Adventure Rulebook.
Rembrandt’s Razors and Blades sells electric
razors, pocket knives, and even display swords and
other melee weapons (E; game characteristics as per
the “Melee Weapons” table on page 119 of the D6
Adventure Rulebook). The knives are combat worthy,
but it’s risky to use the ornamental weapons in a ﬁght
(weapons break on a Critical Failure and those that
aren’t sharpened have damage totals reduced by 5).
The Karmic Crystal sells new-age paraphernalia,
such as tarot decks, crystal balls, Feng Shui guides,
and so on. These can serve as perfect foci for Magic
or Psionics eﬀects. The free-love vegan proprietor,
27-year-old Stefan Millar, believes himself to have
special powers.
The Cellular Division sells cell phones and cell
phone service, including “disposable” cell phones
and numbers (E), although their Spartan selection
and overbearing sales methods may oﬀend some.
Luxury Luggage oﬀers overpriced suitcases and
leather goods (E to M). The more expensive goods
often have lots of cubbyholes and compartments
that can prove ideal for concealment (up to +6 on
hide attempts).
All Rooms Furnished, the most recent “magnet”
store, displays furniture arranged as full rooms, giving a surreal feeling of actually being in a room as its
represented. Each furniture type gets its own display
area, so there are several diﬀerent “bedrooms,” “living rooms,” “recreation rooms,” and so on. The 46year-old manager, Carter Graves, has an irrational
fear that some hoodlums will engage in a ﬁreﬁght or
other combat in his beautiful exhibition rooms.

Sporting Goods
Superjock Gear, a locally owned shop, has equipment for almost any sport (VE to M). The owner,
31-year-old Lila Fleur, is eager to help and fancies

herself as something of an adventurer; as such, she’s
unfazed by oddball requests. (“Best equipment to
smash a Zombie’s head? That’d be a Coopertown
Slugger bat. Solid maple, that.”)
Women’s Sportfeet and Sportfeet Center are
two chain stores that specialize in women’s and
men’s (respectively) footwear and sports goods. The
shoes range from pricey (E; +1 to running, climbing, jumping, and acrobatics rolls involving feet) to
expensive (M; +2 to same rolls).

Things to See
 Items sold in the stores (see speciﬁc store descriptions for ideas)
 Metal or wooden benches
 Green tropical plants, a meter or more tall,
real or fake, in heavy black or ornamental pots
 Metal or wooden trash barrels
 Brochures listing store locations or describing area attractions
 Pay phones

Things to Do
 It’s the Saturday before Christmas — the
busiest shopping day of the year. The players’ characters learn that one patron’s wrapped package actually contains a bomb, set to go oﬀ in one hour. A
general alert may cause more panic and destruction
than the bomb itself; can they ﬁnd the bomb before it’s too late?

Museum
The word “museum” comes from the Greek word
“mouseion” — a place dedicated to the Muses, who
were themselves the divine spirits of the arts. This
ancient deﬁnition holds true today, as museums remain buildings devoted to exhibiting objects and
displays of importance. What is on display depends
on the museum. The art museum — ﬁlled with
paintings, drawings, and sculptures of famous artists — remains the most popular conception, but
museums exist devoted to all kinds of topics: science, history, sports and hobbies, and so on.
The focus and scope of a museum determines
most of its characteristics. For example, a regional
museum dedicated to the history of coal mining in
the area would probably be a modest building, possibly with a coal car in the center, and other artifacts or pictorials hanging loose on walls. A national
art museum, on the other hand, might be a huge,
impressive structure with towering statues, housing
the country’s most valuable objects in phenomenal
security. Museums can take the form of refurbished
warehouses, rededicated palaces, or planned architectural marvels.
A museum has the delicate task of balancing the
need to keep items open and available for viewing
by all, while keeping them protected from unscrupulous or clumsy individuals. Most museums have
a strict “hands-oﬀ” policy, and violating it risks
the wrath of alarms and security guards (although
many science museums encourage touching and

58

D6 Adventure Locations

manipulating exhibits). Many museums, especially
those devoted to art, have more pieces than they
can comfortably display at one time; overstock
items are kept in back areas of the museum or in
warehouses (see the “Warehouse” entry). Museums
often have libraries dedicated to their subjects, especially those devoted to a regional or targeted interest. In fact, often museums are the only source
of certain kinds of information, and a small-town
curator may ﬁnd herself in possession of unique
knowledge she scarcely knows the value of.
The museum remains, by and large, a place of
learning and knowledge. As such, browsing a museum can provide bonuses to scholar rolls, as can
perusing its library or interviewing the curator.
Museums generally charge for entry (Very Easy
Funds roll), but some set aside certain hours or
days for free admittance (such as the last half-hour
of each day, or an annual Museum Appreciation
Day).
Security remains the highest priority for most
museums, and those that house anything of value
will generally have at least a security system, and
probably also security guards. Most museums have
systems that would require a Very Diﬃcult security
check to bypass, although poorer museums might
only require a Moderate check (or less) ... and stealing the Mona Lisa would require a Legendary feat,
at least! Although they usually carry objects of great
value, local budget cuts often hurt museums disproportionately, and underattended locations can
ﬁnd themselves in constant danger of closing.
Museums exist virtually unchanged for any D6
Adventure era, although the trend toward smaller
regional museums is fairly recent (within the past
50 years or so). To simulate a smaller museum with
the provided map, just discard the second ﬂoor
and perhaps replace the dining area with more
displays.

The Gemini Foundation had a unique vision
for its city’s educational and spiritual fulﬁllment.
Instead of having one museum — which narrows
its focus too greatly or else splits its exhibits between art and science — why not have two muse-

ums, separate but linked? This philosophy guided
the creation of the Gemini Museums in 1969, two
buildings that have the same layout and architecture but diﬀerent exhibits. The Castor Museum
focuses on the sciences (both natural and hard),
while the Pollux Museum is devoted to all kinds of
art. The two museums are located about half a mile
apart and structured so that it’s possible to see the
other from the top ﬂoor windows.
Visitors to both museums would ﬁrst notice the
central display area. Castor gives this area over to a
complete tyrannosaurus rex display, while the same
spot in the Pollux building has a piece entitled
“Child’s Play/Adult Nightmare,” where a dinosaurlike simulacrum composed of gigantic steel girders
eats a Human-shaped victim made out of wire.
The chambers are named the same for both museums, so one can speak of being in the “Pollux
Zenith Display” or “Castor Classics Chamber.”
This adds to the confusion, which was part of the
Gemini Foundation’s purpose; it believes the gulf
between science and art is not as great as people
believe, and making the two buildings so closely
linked helps to build an association between the
ﬁelds.

Although the museums rotate their exhibits at
least quarterly, they try to keep certain themes in
the exhibit halls.
The Classics Chamber is devoted to overviews
of the museums’ disciplines; in Pollux, this means
an overview of art, complete with Grecian samples,
Impressionistic versus Realistic displays, and so on.
At Castor, this encompasses a history of the sciences,
up to Galileo. Since this room is the last one visitors
might see before leaving the museum, the curators
try to keep out anything too controversial here.
The New Voices Gallery is focused to the latest
ﬁndings or developments. In Pollux, this generally
means up-and-coming artists and local talent. In
Castor, it means the absolute latest developments
in the sciences (at least, those that would have an
interesting display and spark public imagination).
The Longwall Room is usually devoted to oversized or long exhibits. For example, the Pollux recently displayed two original “splatter paintings”
that took up both walls entirely; the Castor, meanwhile, had an exhibit of electron microscope magniﬁcations of various atoms, blowing up the results
to give a better idea of the beauty and complexity
of matter’s building blocks.

Hello, my
name is...

The Blue Chamber is so-named because its walls,
ﬂoor, and ceiling are painted entirely sky blue. The
Pollux uses this room primarily to display sculptures
in an “open” environment; the results often feel like
the exhibits are ﬂoating in space. Its present exhibit
is a comparison of the Human head, from Grecian
to modern depictions. The Castor uses this room
mostly for intellectual or psychological demonstrations; its current theme is optical illusions.
The Leonardo Annex is devoted to the same
artist in both museums. The Pollux focuses on
Leonardo Da Vinci’s artistic achievements, while
the Castor concentrates on his intellectual and scientiﬁc insights. Both annexes contain original Da
Vinci pieces, and as such are even more heavily
protected and guarded (Legendary security check to
steal or deface the art).
Visiting Exhibits are, logically, devoted to
those pieces that are on loan from other museums.
Security here is tight, and it would take Heroic efforts to tamper or steal anything. At present the
Pollux has three Monet and two Renoir paintings on
loan, while the Castor has several original journals
of Copernicus. From the Castor Visiting Exhibit
room it’s possible to see into the Zenith Display
and Illumination Wing South of the Pollux.
The Mittelhauser Room is named after a wealthy
contributor, and it contains items donated by patrons over the years. This room is the one most likely to have items that defy classiﬁcation; the Pollux
presently has some abstract fourteenth-century
carvings that seem made out of an unknown kind
of wood, while the Castor has a series of large metal
sheets inscribed with intriguing but untranslatable
runes or icons.
Serenity East and Serenity West are linked
rooms, and their exhibits usually spill across both
rooms. The purpose of those rooms is to provide
“popular” exhibits or art. The Pollux’s Serenity
Rooms are currently devoted to pop art, while the
Castor has an exhibit entitled “10 Inventions that
Changed the World.”
The Zenith Display is the only room in both
museums to make heavy use of natural light. As
one of the most stunning rooms in the museum,
the Zenith Display’s exhibits tend toward the ﬂashy
instead of instructive. Presently, the Pollux has a
collection of modern blown glass, while the Castor

60

D6 Adventure Locations

has a giant prism and information about optics.
The windows of the Zenith Display provide a theoretical chink in the museum’s defenses (Moderate
security check to break in), if someone could ﬁgure
out how to get to the second ﬂoor window.
Illumination Wing North and Illumination
Wing South, like the Serenity rooms, are linked.
However, while Serenity strives toward popular
exhibits, the Illumination Wing attempts to be
more confrontational and challenging. The Pollux
currently shows mathematical representations and
methods of artwork (including an aural display of
Igor Stravinsky’s serialist music), while the Castor
has a presentation on “The Search for God,” detailing the conﬂicts and parallels of science, philosophy, and religion.
The Hall of Accomplishments is basically a
retread of the Classics Chamber, only with more
room to go in depth. If the Classic Chamber provides an appetizer or dessert, the Timeline is the
main course. Given its open nature, pieces of extreme value are seldom kept here; instead, copies
and representations of pieces are displayed.
The remaining areas are fairly mundane. The
Audio-Visual Room has supplemental material
about one of the museum’s exhibits, the oﬃces
house the security team or curator, and the Gift
Shop oﬀers somewhat expensive souvenirs (Very
Easy to Moderate; +1 to Funds diﬃculties). Unlike
many museums, the Gemini museums have a food
court, giving patrons an on-site location to chat
about what they just saw.
The museums are open Monday through
Saturday from 10:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M., and on
Sunday from 1:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. The remainder of the time the museums remain tightly secured, requiring a Very Diﬃcult security check to
get in and additional checks to get to each room
(unless otherwise noted). The Pollux’s curator is
Dr. Travis Starlin, an aﬀable 57-year-old with an
art history doctorate and a love of teaching. The
Castor is run by Dr. Sheila Gerber, a 68-year-old
physicist whose uncooperative nature is almost
legendary; while Dr. Starlin is a believer in the
Gemini concept, Dr. Gerber expresses open contempt at the idea and sees the museums as being
in direct competition. What aﬀect this animosity
will have is unknown.

People to Meet
Most museum employees have between 1D and
2D in the physical attributes and between 2D and
3D in mental attributes (especially Knowledge).
Those who manipulate exhibits tend to have better-than-average Physique scores and pips in lifting.
Curators tend to have at least +2D in scholar and
+1D in forgery, although higher scores are possible
and encouraged. Security guards are detailed in the
D6 Adventure Rulebook on page 126.

Things to Do
 The players’ characters manage to thwart a
museum theft of a fake exhibit. They learn the thief
probably knew it was a imitation ... so why did he
steal it? Is there some information or item hidden
in the fake artifact?
 One of the items in the museum actually
serves as an interdimensional portal to Someplace

Else, and the players’ characters are on hand as the
ﬁrst beings beam across. Can they ﬁnd a way to turn
the tide against these combative individuals, while
protecting priceless exhibits from the crossﬁre?

Ofﬁce
The oﬃce building remains one of the enduring
symbols of white-collar workers, commerce, and
business. The typical building contains multiple ofﬁces, ranging from the cubicle farms of low-level
clerical workers to the scenic windowed oﬃces of
managers and company presidents. Oﬃces contain
all the elements for eﬃcient conduction of business: desks, telephones, word-processing devices,
and the like. The typical building also has all manner of oﬃce supplies, ranging from mundane paper,
pens, and correction ﬂuid, to more esoteric devices
such as binding machines, paper cutters, and highcapacity shredders.
Unless managers are careful, medium-sized or
larger oﬃces tend to encourage factionalism and
clustering, so that it’s possible for some groups not
to know what others are doing. In fact, a splinter
group’s actions within a company — or attempts
to leave a company — can form riveting front-page
drama.
Oﬃces usually have their own rules and regulations that determine their “personality.” Some keep
a stoic and professional environment, with formal
dress regulations, canned Muzak, and rigid policies.
Others keep a more laid-back atmosphere, permitting casual dress, radios at desks, and relaxed rules;
some oﬃces go so far to encourage “outside the
box” thinking that they permit rollerblading inside
or on-site air hockey tables.
“Modern” oﬃces have existed for centuries, and
elements with direct parallels — such as scribes toiling over scrolls about a kingdom’s aﬀairs — have existed since antiquity. The oﬃce’s era determines the
type of equipment: A pulp-era oﬃce would have
manual typewriters, carbon paper, and pneumatic
tubes; a 1960s spy-era workplace would have tele-

D6 Adventure Locations

61

Hello, my

type, photocopiers, and electric typewriters; and a
modern building would have computer networks,
scanners, and color printers. In a world with steampunk, magical, or fantastic elements, the oﬃce
building is usually one of the ﬁrst places those elements will appear, such as mana-powered facsimile
machines, psionic international conferencing systems, or steam-powered computational devices. In
the near-future, oﬃces will exist as they do now,
albeit with sleeker computers, improved security,
and so on. However, the advent of increased telecommunications technology will likely make home
oﬃces much more common, reducing the need for
monolithic oﬃce buildings.

Jan Serval bought the Forrester Building in
1999 from a defunct dot-com company that sold
keychains online. Ms. Serval has since turned the
oﬃce into Serval Consulting, a ﬁnancial consulting
ﬁrm that specializes in “no questions asked” business
dealings and problem-solving. Although she refuses
to do anything knowingly illegal — she insists her

62

D6 Adventure Locations

company remains snowy white — she also ensures
her company doesn’t do any extensive questioning
that would place her deniability at risk. As a result,
and unknown to her, she has a considerable reputation among the underworld, which has guidelines
for how to best utilize Serval Consulting’s services.
The Forrester Building’s exterior shatter-resistant
glass walls (Toughness 3D) provide remarkable
openness and breathtaking natural lighting, while
the glass elevator supports 10 people comfortably.
Serval Consulting is open from 8:30 A.M. through
5:30 P.M., and it remains locked the rest of the time.
The front double doors provide the only normal
means in and out (Moderate lockpicking to enter),
and the entire building is served by an expensive
security system (Diﬃcult security check to thwart).
Serval Consulting currently employs 17 workers, and it has room to expand by one manager, two
underlings, and another information technology expert. Ms. Serval treats her clients and employees very
well, and no one would willingly give up information
about her. Ms. Serval works in the top ﬂoor Senior
Oﬃce, and only her terminal has complete access to
the oﬃce network (Diﬃcult tech roll to access all information; her client’s ﬁnances are a “closely guarded

secret” to decipher, resulting in a +15 diﬃculty to
business rolls). She meets with clients either in her
oﬃce or the Conference Room, depending on her
mood and how many people are involved.
Clients who utilize Serval Consulting may invest
Funds dice with the company; for as long as those
dice are invested, they count twice (thus someone
with 4D in Funds who invests 2D of that amount
has 6D Funds available). However, a failure on a
Funds roll utilizing those dice makes those extra
dice unavailable for three months, while a Critical
Failure means the investor loses the extra dice and
the invested dice for six months. In addition, if
Serval Consulting runs afoul of the law or other
sabotage, those invested dice might be lost forever
... or at least until the matter is resolved.

Expanding the Building
For larger oﬃce buildings, this map can easily be expanded to by duplicating the second
ﬂoor to represent the third or higher ﬂoors.
Each additional ﬂoor adds room for 15 employees. The practical limit to this expansion
is around eight ﬂoors, or about 100 employees.
However, higher levels — especially the top
ﬂoor — might contain luxury oﬃces, given the
superior view, and resulting in a lower number
of employees. In a huge oﬃce building, the top
ﬂoor’s senior oﬃce and cubicle room would
be merged, making a gargantuan presidential
suite.

People to Meet
Most oﬃce employees have 1D+1 to 2D in all
attributes, although it is not uncommon for workers to have 1D in a physical attribute (Reﬂexes,
Coordination, or Physique) and 3D in Knowledge (for
clerical, research, or ﬁnancial work), Perception (for
artistic or problem-solving businesses) or Presence
(for sales-heavy businesses). One or more skill dice
in business is common for managers, and most
workers usually have at least a couple pips relating to whatever goods or services the oﬃce revolves
around: scholar regarding the oﬃce’s focus, tech for
electronics-heavy ﬁelds, and so on. Charm, con, or
persuasion are also common, especially in interpersonal or sales ﬁelds; which skill is chosen greatly
aﬀects how those interactions are conducted.

Park
Parks provide urban denizens an escape from the
sprawl of asphalt and concrete that binds them,
whether it is a quick walk in the local city park or
a camping trip to a state or national park. They are
places dedicated to preserving one bit of nature for
the enjoyment of the citizens. In a typical adventure, this happy, shiny fun is bound to be shattered
by the intrusion of villains bent on crashing the
party.
Parks come in many sizes. In cities, they can be
as small as one street corner or as large as several
blocks, such as Central Park in New York. In rural areas, nature preserves can be a couple hundred
hectares, encompassing a forest or lake, or a vast

64

D6 Adventure Locations

tract of tens of thousands of hectares holding entire
mountain ranges, wetlands, or wildlife sanctuary.
(For suggestions concerning forest and meadow locations, see their entry herein.)
Urban parks are convenient places for characters to have meetings with illicit informants who
desire a public place where violence would be too
conspicuous. The advantage of a city park is that is
can be well traﬃcked and yet still have spots which
that secluded (some secluded enough to server
as locations for dumping a body after a murder).
Although regardless of how public or isolated the
location in the park, people still disappear from
plain site and secret rendezvouses can be discovered
without warning.
In park settings, often the innocent bystanders
prove useful plot devices. Especially since parks almost always have some kind of play area, hordes
of children that frequent these could to be taken
hostage, witness to a horrible crime, or obstacles
in gun ﬁghts and car chases. It adds a nice touch
of guilt when little Timmy ends up in the hospital
because some trigger-happy character used a hand
grenade near the monkey bars. Moreover, these
children attract scores of vendors whose stands can

provide a splatter of color to any vehicle ripping
through the place in hot pursuit.
Also, these places make great areas to assemble
huge crowds for festivals, sporting events, concerts,
protests, political rallies, and an assortment of other gatherings. Introducing mayhem, which most
characters are prone to do simply by being present,
can produce several noncombat problems to deal
with. These might include ﬁres, riots, stampedes of
people, medical emergencies, and so on.
While parks can have a wide assortment of amenities, a typical example of a city park generally includes a baseball diamond, playground, restrooms,
picnic benches, and a monument or fountain.
An average size would be about four city blocks,
generally in a square or rectangular conﬁguration.
In addition to this, parks may have tennis courts,
basketball courts, a soccer ﬁeld, lake, bike paths, a
stage, and so on.
Placement of playgrounds and such frequently
falls close to the borders of the park. This leaves a
lot of wide-open areas for moving around near the
middle, with the center of parks existing as the favored location for monuments and fountains. The
layout generally has a number of sidewalks or paths
crisscrossing the area, and they may border the park
as well. Stages and baseball diamonds typically face
the inside of the park.
Monuments in older parks are usually statues
of historical signiﬁcance, often of military heroes
or politicians, or are simple markers with plaques
commemorating things such as battles, foundation of a town, sponsors of the park, and the like.
Both types are generally sturdy enough to force a
fast-moving vehicle or horseman to make way. In
recently built parks, artwork includes mural boards
and sculptures in traditional or abstract designs,
and their resilience as obstacles varies based on
their materials (from 1D Toughness for wood to
4D for metal structures).
Rural state and national parks often encompass
one large, continuous geographic area, like a large
forest, mountains, swamp, or similar territory. They
feature campgrounds, nature trails, picnic areas,
and sometimes a nature center or museum focusing
on the local sights, sites, and environmental issues.
Most are relatively safe, but getting lost or cut oﬀ
by bad weather is possible. The more sizeable na-

tional parks, such as Yellowstone, may include the
appearance of bears, deer, moose, wolves, or even
a mountain lion. Other parks may have diﬀerent
types of animals, depending on the climate and location, but seldom is the animal population dense
enough to provide large or numerous encounters.
Some parks do allow hunting, which could provide
problems for characters wandering around without
a caution-orange jacket.

Most pedestrians have the typical 2D in attributes, with a couple of skills at +1D. Children have

have 4D or 5D in an appropriate specialization.
(See the “Apartment” entry for suggested characteristics for a child.) Campers and hunters may
have +1D to +2D in survival and perhaps a combat skill. Police oﬃcers often frequent city parks
due to the children and to display their presence to
the public openly. Their characteristics are on page

Things to Do
 The players’ characters track a dangerous
gunman into the local park. After loosing him for
a few minutes through some trees they encounter
him at the edge of a playground. He is squatting
down and talking to a little girl, and he apparently
has her ball. One wrong move and the situation
could turn very bloody for Molly and her secondgrade class.

Restaurant
Restaurants are a wide-ranging location with
hole-in-the-wall greasy spoons, fast food joints,
and even ﬁne luxury dining halls falling under their
classiﬁcation.
Restaurants diﬀer in three things: size, quality of
food and service, and cleanliness. There are some
tiny unsanitary cafes that have the best food you
will ever ﬁnd. Similarly, a high-priced, immaculate
restaurant might have incredibly poor service or
mediocre food.
Restaurants are great places to test players and
their characters. Have them be served by an incredibly rude waiter or a maitre d’ who demands they
wear semi-formal attire (dresses or a coat and tie)
while dining. There’s also nothing quite like the
shock on players’ faces when their characters wan-

66

D6 Adventure Locations

der into a restaurant’s kitchen and see how vile it
really is — no matter how good their food was.
A restaurant exists as a great place to plant hidden foes of the characters. Is that annoying waiter
just trying to get a big tip, or is he really reﬁlling the
water glasses a little too much just to keep tabs on
the conversation the characters are having? Could
the real chef be tied up in the freezer in the back
while his “replacement” is secretly plotting to poison the characters? And maybe that waitress with
the plunging neckline is just a little too friendly for
the characters’ own good.
Restaurants are great meeting places as they are
in public and tend to have such a din in the background that all but the most boisterous conversations go unnoticed even by people sitting nearby.
This may require Perception or search checks if the
characters are trying to spy on someone, but it also
gives them cover for clandestine conversations.

Don’t Miss ...
Jimmy opened his restaurant with a little help
from his Uncle Vinnie. Taking a clue
from other popular restaurants of the
time, he decorated it with chachkis
of the neighborhood he grew up in
and the city itself. It’s by no means
a large location, but it’s big enough
for Jimmy. He contents himself with
a fairly regular ﬂow of customers,
which keeps him busy.
Booths line the walls of Jimmy’s Place. Jimmy
hadn’t wanted booths, but it was one of several
“recommendations” Uncle Vinnie required him to
undertake if he wanted the start up money. With
some tips from an old girlfriend, he found suitably nostalgic decorations to match the red leather
booths, and now he’s grown to like the look.
Four booths each occupy the right and left walls,
with a single large booth against the back wall. This
booth is almost always reserved for Uncle Vinnie
and his friends, who eat there most nights.
The center of the restaurant has a mix of square
tables just large enough for four to sit at and small
enough to be easily combined to make a seating
arrangement for a larger group.

Lit candles stand on
all the tables, and the
lights are turned down
low. Jimmy likes the
ambience, and he was
happy that his uncle
had
recommended
setting up the restaurant this way. It oﬀers
enough light to keep
the restaurant from being hazardous to the
wait staﬀ, but it allows
those seated in booths a
measure of privacy. This
has attracted a number
of couples, young and
old, to Jimmy’s Place,
and they are often the
bigger tippers.
The service counter sits just inside the
front door facing into the restaurant. Jimmy likes
to watch his wait staﬀ as they help the clientele.
The windows are mirrored, with Jimmy’s Place
emblazoned on them (a “restaurant warming” gift
from Uncle Vinnie), so no one can see he has his
back to the street that often. Jimmy wouldn’t admit it, but he secretly enjoys watching people go
by when the restaurant isn’t open. He ﬁnds it especially amusing when they stop and ﬁx themselves
up in the window like it was a mirror.
To the left of the booth against the back wall are
the restrooms. To its right are the swinging doors
into the kitchen. Not an overly large kitchen by
any means, it has two grills, a counter in the middle
to prepare food on, a walk-in freezer, a large sink,
and a dishwasher. The back door of the restaurant
opens onto an alley with a light just above the door
and the dumpster immediately to the door’s right.

Things to Do
 Jimmy’s Uncle Vinnie isn’t as altruistic as
the nephew may think. Vinnie is better known as
Vinnie Two-Toes (he used to be Vinnie Three-Toes
before that unfortunate accident). He’s a capo in
the local maﬁa. He helped Jimmy set up the restaurant to serve as his de facto headquarters. Vinnie
has nothing to do with the running of the business; it’s strictly on the up and up, and he likes it
that way. He can come to Jimmy’s Place and meet
with his people in the booth in the back and not
worry about the Feds busting in on the joint. The
candle holders in the restaurant actually serve as
jammers for any eavesdropping devices that might
be brought into the restaurant. Furthermore, the
booth in the back is far enough away from any
other to keep its conversations private.
The characters are eating at Jimmy’s Place when
three masked men in suits walk in with shotguns
and proceed to tell everyone to get down: “This is a
robbery.” Uncle Vinnie and his friends are outraged
by the audacity of such an action and begin shooting at the men from their booth. The gunmen ﬂip
over a few tables, and pretty soon, the characters
are caught in the crossﬁre of a mob war.

Spaceship
Traversing the vast depths of interstellar space, a
spaceship is many things to its passengers and crew:
safety, transportation, convenience, home. Available
in a myriad of shapes and sizes constrained only
by style, technology, and budget, the spaceship
might house the foes of the players’ characters or
serves them as a base of operations from which to
explore the unknown. When used as an adventure
location instead of a vehicle, the spaceship provides
many exciting adventure possibilities. It might be
the object of a search — buried under arctic ice,
crash-landed in the jungle, or hidden in the depths
of the sea. Or, it can serve as a means of bringing
the adventure to the characters, with its alien crew
contacting or abducting them.
For adventure setting purposes, it is not the ship
as a vehicle that is important. (Gamemasters who
wish give game characteristics to the vehicle could
build it using the system found in the D6 Space
Rulebook.) Rather, it’s the ship as a place, particularly one with numerous aspects to it that are only
slightly familiar to Humans — or maybe so strange
as to prove bothersome to Human senses. Perhaps a
barely breathable or odious atmosphere is present,
gloomily lit by eerie green or grey lighting. Perhaps
the lighting is subject to an odd Doppler shift, giving everything a fuzzy, out-of-focus look (+2D to
sight-based diﬃculties). The strange atmosphere
(thick, thin, with a distinctive taste or odor, etc.)
and quasi-metallic wall plates may distort sounds,
creating bizarre echoes or hair-raising subsonic
noises.

Don’t Miss ...
A ﬂattened ovoid, the traditional ﬂying saucer
has long been a staple of science-ﬁction. The ﬂattened ovoid design theoretically improves speed if
an “etheric drive” is utilized to reduce drag from
normal space or atmospheric entry. The shape can

also serve to reduce sensor detection.
Overall, the ovoid hull eats up some
usable crew space, but fuel or equipment parts may be stored in the uninhabitable cubby spaces.
This example is operated by the
mysterious Greys, who have appeared
countless times in literature as foes, tourists, amoral
scientists, refugees from distant alien wars, or bored
biology students.
The Harvester-Scout (scale 14) boasts a modest
faster-than-light drive (approximately three light
years per day) and fairly slow sublight engine. Its alloyed hull provides moderate protection (Toughness
3D) — even a low-tech missile can bring it down.
Thus, the mysterious Greys seek to avoid detection and combat at all costs: The ship boasts extremely reﬁned stealth systems, including electromagnetic emissions control, direct sensor baﬄers,
and a holographic shield to prevent visual detection. The systems tend to be quite fragile, and a
crash landing or battle damage can easily disrupt
them. Rumors that ships such as this have appeared
with blazing search and navigation lights cause
UFO hunters no end of confusion. Perhaps other
races are visiting Earth use similar means of transportation and are not as concerned about stealth.
Entry to the ship is via the lift-tube (1) located
on the craft’s axis. The tube extends downward to
the ground approximately nine meters. Once in
the lift, access to any deck is possible (unless the
Greys have activated a security lock-out). Several
maintenance hatches (at the gamemasters’ discretion) are placed on the upper and lower hull surfaces. Normally sealed, characters may ﬁnd some
have blown open during combat or the subsequent
crash landing.
The lower deck will be the ﬁrst deck the lift-tube
provides access to. It houses the engineering core
(11), which provides access to the large realspace
drive (13) and its venting ports, the FTL drive
(12), and the ship’s weapon mount (14). Note the
weapon mount is ﬁxed — the ship must be maneuvered in order to line up a shot on the horizontal
axis. The weapon can traverse vertically approximately 20 degrees in either arc. All the equipment
in this section is very fragile – weapons ﬁre or even
low-tech explosives can wreak havoc with the en-

gines (which may contain caustic chemicals and
poisonous fuels for added excitement). In a “crashlanded” scenario, the engineering deck may be a
very dangerous mess — and the ship’s computer
or crew may have sealed the lift-tube doors to stop
chemical ﬁres and radiation leaks. There are several crawl spaces throughout the engineering deck,
allowing the diminutive Grey engineers access to
various components (+10 to movement diﬃculties
for beings of scale 0).
The middle deck is the main section of the ship.
Three doorways lead from the lift-tube room. One
leads into general storage (9) where various odds
and ends of alien technology are stored, including
concentrated foodstuﬀs and miscellaneous baggage.
(In some conﬁgurations of the ship, the auxiliary
storage area along the main corridor serves as a lab,
communication room, or other specialized area.)
A door leads to an axial corridor providing access
deeper into the deck. The ﬁnal door leads to a disturbing place: the operating theatre wherein many
a hapless person has awoken to strange creatures or
machines looming over him, inserting probes into
his bodily cavities or bringing whining saws or drills

D6 Adventure Locations

on-line. The theatre houses stationary operating
tables, holding tanks and tubes, odd machines and
sensors suspended from ceiling mounts, and large
animal pens (most often holding a cow or two). A
large hatch at the back of the room drops down
allowing for quick loading of victims via a ramp or
small (900-kilogram capacity) tractor beam.
When the Greys aren’t happily vivisecting some
poor Terran creature, people are held in a series of
prisoner cells (7) accessible by a door to the operating theatre. The cells are sparse, with a waste pit
hole, water dispenser, and little else — prisoners
are too drugged, psychically stunned, or shocked
to complain much.
On the opposite side of the hull are the crew
quarters (8). The bizarre living quarters of the crew
may consist of bare ﬂoors and a zero-g ﬂoating mat
resembling half of a glowing green coconut, pools
of gelatin-like slime serving as sleeping and recreation areas, or a perfectly preserved room from
Victorian England, replete with gold trim, marble
ﬂoors, stone ﬁreplace and heavy tapestries.
The ﬁnal room on the deck is the armory (10)
located on the axial corridor. Here, the Greys keep

their stunners, drug-devices, psionic mind-wrenches, plasma guns, and the like.
The upper deck is the nerve center for the ship.
It houses the bridge (2), with a huge built-in
viewscreen and numerous acceleration couches or
command chairs, instruments busily burbling and
bleeping, and most likely a crew determined to selfdestruct the ship before the Humans can claim it.
Two large cylindrical tubes with glowing interiors
housing things that look like brains of cows comprise the computer core (3) The computer system
is extremely alien and attempting any task with it
should be Very Diﬃcult under the most generous
circumstances. A cryo-tubes section (4) allows the
crew to be safely ensconced for extremely long journeys. Crewmen injured beyond the capability of the
Grey surgeons to heal are placed here. This can be an
idea place to trap players’ character who want to try
them out. Alternatively, the interstellar travel using
Grey technology is too dangerous for living Humans
— they must take some very risky chances and use
the cryo-tubes during any space voyage. Lastly, a
maintenance ring (5) runs the circumference of
the ship on all three decks. This ring gives access the
hull, sensors, other concealed machinery for repairs.
The interior walls have a Toughness of 5D. Doors
have a Toughness of 3D with Diﬃcult to Very
Diﬃcult security electronic locks (security may be

Spaceship Combat
Combat in the ship should be very diﬃcult for
characters — remember the Greys are bizarre.
They see in very dim, odd-colored light, breathe
a strange atmosphere and hear at a much higher
frequency. They may even be capable of crawling on walls or ceilings using sticky membranes
on their limbs. To emphasize the alienness of the
setting, combat and exploration modiﬁers range
from +5 to +15 or more to diﬃculty numbers.
It may be hard to dodge when you cannot correctly determine how the wall is shaped or even
where it is! Shooting a Grey at short range while
trying to see past nauseating green strobe lighting with luminous mists ﬂowing around makes
even an expert marksman ﬂinch.

out of commission if the ship is crashed). The prison cells may use forceﬁelds (possibly shorted out or
intensiﬁed during a crash) or solid doors with 5D
damage resistance and Heroic security electronic
locks. Most interior equipment has damage resistance of 2D to 4D — and possibly containing odd
chemicals or ﬂammable lubricants.

Things to See
 Handheld electronic devices and weapons of
unearthly origin
 Strange food in simply marked plastic-like,
vacuum-sealed containers or bags
 Medical instruments only vaguely resembling anything seen on Earth
 Narrow metal examination table, attached to
the ﬂoor
 Sheets of thin plastic-like material inscribed
with strange characters — they could be instruction manuals or letters home
 Shimmering fabric, draped over beds or cut
into robes, with a thickness of cotton but the feel of
silk and a toughness of woven metal

People to Meet
The stereotypical alien manning a saucer-shaped
craft is generally not any more physically sturdy
than a Human. Other people that characters might
encounter include cultists, treasure seekers, scientists, soldiers, and members of secret government
agencies. For cultists and treasure seekers, use the
generic person described in the introduction. For
scientists and solders, see their entries on page 126

Hello, my

Things to Do
 A group of wacky cultists, who call themselves the Cultists of the Star-Born, hold regular
services aboard a downed UFO, convinced the
major religious and social ﬁgures of history were
actually beneﬁcent aliens in disguise. The players’
characters stumble across or are sent to investigate
this small cult located in a rural area.
Upon arrival, the investigators must try to ﬁgure
out who the cultists are, where they are meeting,
and why. Eventually, the characters gain entry to
the ship — which could be an oversized version of
the one presented here — and overhear the cultists
during their venerations.
But all is not well. During this particular service, the additional warmth of the characters has
activated the dormant self-defense artiﬁcial intelligence aboard the ship, which is now using its
“bio-breeder” (replace the cryo-tubes in area 4) to
create a very dangerous series of bioroids. At ﬁrst,
the creatures begin knocking oﬀ lone cultists exploring or praying in various sections of the ship.
Eventually, enough bioroids appear for a concerted
attack on the mass cult gathering. In the confusion
and slaughter (highlighted by bewildered cultists
praying to their alien gods in an attempt to appease
them), the characters must rescue the doomed fools
and themselves.
 A sunken alien ship is found in the South
Paciﬁc dating from World War II (or during
the war!). The players’ characters are assigned to
investigate.
Little do they know, the intelligent ship seeks a
new crew and picks up the hapless heroes in its quest
to complete a mission to Alpha Centauri! There, it
hopes to ﬁnd the cryo-preserved remains of its race
at a long-abandoned scientiﬁc outpost. The hideouslooking aliens are all that is left of a peaceful star-faring people. The characters, during the month-long
trip to the outpost, learn to make friendly contact
with the ship and begin to assimilate some skills, allowing a degree of control and interaction with the
craft. Such skills may include stardrive repair, starship gunnery, and space navigation.
However, as they arrive at the outpost, the evil
cybernetic insectoids who wiped out the ship’s cre-

72

D6 Adventure Locations

ators are alerted. The characters must revive the last
members of the shipbuilder’s race, escape the insectoid’s ground forces in a running gun battle (made
survivable thanks only to the characters’ lower tech
weapons), and evade the insectoid ﬂeet.
Eventually, the characters must help the shipbuilders ﬁnd a new home and a new beginning
— perhaps on a small blue planet called … Earth.

School
Schools come in many shapes and sizes, depending on the level of education they provide, as well
as the school’s era and geographical location. Rural
schools meant for children under the age of 12 can
have as few as ﬁve or six rooms altogether, while
even relatively obscure universities are often sprawling complexes of single- and multi-story classroom
buildings, residence halls, and research facilities.
Schools can diﬀer tremendously from one town to
the next, exhibiting marked diﬀerences in quality
and maintenance due to varying tax policies, education disbursement, and interest by parents and
teachers. Some modern U.S. schools have changed
little from the simple designs used in the prairie
states during the mid-1800s, but many schools
have since had to expand outward (or upward, in
the case of urban schools) to accommodate everincreasing student enrollment.
Grade schools are storehouses of smaller versions
of everyday items such as pencils, chairs, desks, and
toilets. They tend to have open, airy classrooms
with plenty of windows to admit sunlight and fresh
air, and walls decorated with cheery, often holidayrelated student artwork. Modern U.S. high schools,
on the other hand, seem designed, not to nurture
students, but to introduce them to the professional
world of windowless cubicles. Furthermore, due to
several recent tragedies, many high schools have
been built or renovated to incorporate smaller windows, restricted access points, metal detectors, shatterproof glass, silent alarms, sophisticated surveillance equipment, and reinforced doors that seal oﬀ

school sections like ship bulkheads. While stiﬂing
to the educational process, such buildings make excellent makeshift fortresses in an emergency. Many
schools built during the Cold War era can double
as nuclear fallout shelters, although the stores of
food and water mandated by civil defense policy
have long since been stolen, depleted, or removed.

Don’t Miss ...
This typical, suburban high school is built on a
mostly square plan, its classrooms and oﬃces surrounding a central landscaped courtyard used as an
outdoor retreat for certain classes. Parents and other
visitors use the building’s main entrance more often than the students, who prefer to use secondary
entrances conveniently located near bus drop-oﬀ
zones and the student/employee parking lot.
This campus includes 12 to 14 classrooms on
each of three ﬂoors (two ﬂoors were added just
before the crush of baby-boomers in the district
grew to high school age). A staircase connects the
levels for most students, while an elevator facilitates temporarily/permanently handicapped stu-

dents and teachers access to the upper ﬂoors. A set
of restrooms are scattered on each ﬂoor. Two lab
classrooms, equipped for both physics and chemistry classes, can be found on the second ﬂoor. The
teacher’s lounge, which includes private restroom
facilities, is located on the third ﬂoor. Oﬃce space
for the school principal, school nurse, and other
administrative personnel, is situated next to the
main entrance. There are additional oﬃces for each
department on the second and third ﬂoor. The
school custodian occupies a small oﬃce and storeroom over the school power plant (which is in the
basement), next to the gymnasium.
The school gymnasium, attached to one corner
of the school, has student locker rooms with showers and restroom facilities. The gym’s large equipment lockers hold various sports-related equipment, and its foldout bleachers serve the building’s
secondary purpose of hosting sporting events,
school assemblies, student plays, and other functions. Next to the gymnasium is a large indoor
pool with diving board and separate student locker
room and shower facilities. The school lunchroom,
located on the opposite side of the building, has a

D6 Adventure Locations

73

Hello, my
name is...

full-facility kitchen, spacious storeroom, and seating for 400 students. The two-story school library,
attached to another end of the building, has its own
internal staircase. Extensive duct work and steam
tunnels, holdovers from the days of coal and oil-derived power, crisscross the entire building; anyone
knowledgeable in their layout can use them to gain
quick, discreet access to any room in the school.

Things to See
 Wood or plastic-and-metal desks
 Wood or plastic and metal straightback
chairs
 School supplies (pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpener, notebooks, notepaper, tape in a small
dispenser, glue sticks, etc.)
 Inspirational or informative posters
 Black chalkboard with chalk
 White, laminated wipe-oﬀ board with suitable markers
 Desktop personal computers
 Typewriters
 Art supplies (paints, paintbrushes, drawing
paper, colored chalk, oil crayons, etc.)
 Shop tools and supplies (saws, hammers,
nails, sandpaper, screwdriver, screws, wood pieces,
thin metal pieces, etc.)
 Band instruments (clarinet, ﬂute, trombone,
trumpet, tuba, cymbals, drums and sticks, etc.)

People to Meet
School oﬃcials and teachers have 2D in each attribute, with perhaps 3D in Knowledge, Perception, or
Physique. Teachers have 3D in artist, business, scholar,
or tech specializations related to their primary teaching subject. Students’ attributes typically range from
1D to 2D with a pip in a few skills, and students at
higher levels of education or active in extracurricular
activities may have more dice in relevant skill specializations. (For game characteristics for a child, see
the “Apartment” entry in this book.)

Things to Do
 Mark Speizer is a scam-artist who makes his
living defrauding grief-stricken mourners by faking a talent for “communication” with the dead. Or
at least he used to… Mark’s life changed one year
ago while making an episode of his television show,
Convergences. He was hamming it up as he often
did in front of live studio audiences — rolling his
eyes back in his head, mumbling strange words,
trembling like a leaf in a strong wind, and beseeching the spirits to answer him — but this time, one
did. When Mark awoke hours later in a hospital
room, he thought he had crossed that line in show
business that a good fakir never crosses (namely,
starting to believe your own scam). But not only
was the voice still there, it wanted to teach him a
secret that had long lain hidden — the secret of
raising and commanding the dead. Mark doubted
his sanity at ﬁrst, but the voice oﬀered him a gift, a
taste of pure life essence that ﬁlled him with power.
The voice promised he would enjoy such pleasures
forever, if only he did as the voice commanded. It
was too much for Mark to resist. Fast-forward to
today. Mark is no longer a famous television psychic. Instead he stands at the head of a very special
army of unfeeling soldiers…
The players’ characters are transporting a priceless Sumerian artifact (recovered from international
black market traﬃckers — or any other similarly
mystical item from their last adventure) when their
vehicle breaks down, stranding them after dark (but
not too late) near a high school. Eerily, the roads
are empty, no pedestrians walk the streets, and no
cell phone can raise a signal — it’s as if the whole
world has gone still, except for a lone night bird circling and calling high overhead. Suddenly, ﬁgures
step out of the darkness and begin walking toward
the characters, growing in number with each step,
eventually coming into view under a nearby street
light. At this point, even the most unintelligent
player’s character recognizes the pedestrians for

what they are — Zombies. If the characters move
or make any sounds at all, the corpses sprint toward
them, forcing them to retreat to the high school
and bar the doors. Fortunately at least one of the
players’ characters has read the Zombie Survival
Guide, fortuitously written and published after the
turn of the millennium by Max Brooks for under
US$15 (ISBN 1-4000-4962-8; available at better
retailers), so they know a good place to hide when
they see one.
Trouble is, these Zombies don’t need to eat
brains (although they would eat ﬂesh if they got
close enough to bite the person). The dark magicks
that animate these Zombies allow them to drain
life energy from any person within three meters and channel this resultant miasma to Mark
Speizer, making him stronger. (Mark has Life
Drain: Physical Attributes (R1), Zombie servant
must be near target, with Extended Range (R1),

no Zombies left, Burn-out (R1), the gift might

real powers? The answer remains to be seen…

without fear of being seen or overheard. It also
gives them a place to train in secret and to store
their ﬁles and equipment. On the other hand, it
provides the same beneﬁts for their enemies, and
locating a foe’s secret headquarters can be next to
impossible, especially if the foe is clever and chose
his location carefully. Stumbling across someone’s
headquarters can also lead to interesting games, as
the characters try to ﬁgure out whose headquarters
this is and what they use it for — and perhaps try
to shut it down or claim it for their own.
Technically, a secret headquarters can be any
place where characters meet secretly. That would
include something as simple as a college dorm
room or the stairway of a high school. But more
commonly, secret headquarters refer to places a little more advanced and more specialized, locations
that have been outﬁtted to function as a base of
operations rather than locations chosen on the spur
of the moment or used as-is.
The most important feature for a secret headquarters is location. It could built in heart of a
large city, on the city outskirts, or well beyond city
limits. It might be beneath the streets, high above
them, or on ground level.
For example, normal oﬃce in a quiet oﬃce
building can be an eﬀective secret headquarters if
no one knows what business owns the oﬃce, or
what work is done there,
and if the oﬃce’s occupants
have some way of entering
and exiting the oﬃce (and,
preferably, the building)
unseen. Some secret headquarters use high-tech entry
methods, like sliding ﬂoor
panels and special-access elevators. Others concentrate
on misdirection, like a door
concealed behind a wall hanging or even a small
“Out of Order” sign hanging on a bathroom door.
The methods will vary based upon the headquarter’s location, its budget, and the interests and skills
of its users. Of course, the headquarters of a trio
of cutting-edge scientists and metalsmiths will have
elaborate mechanical entrances, but the headquarters of a group of ﬁghting monks will be simpler
and have a more meditative, even mystical, entry.

Secret
Headquarters
Some organizations and individuals can operate
openly, like the police, licensed private detectives,
or a law ﬁrm. But others must conceal their identity and operations, for whatever reasons. And those
who need concealment need a place where they can
do their work in secret, without anyone suspecting.
That requires a secret headquarters.
A secret headquarters gives the characters a place
where they can meet and openly discuss matters,

D6 Adventure Locations

75

Hello, my
name is...

Every secret headquarters has a strategy room,
meeting chamber, tactics area, or war room where
the headquarter’s occupants meet to discuss current
events and plan out their next moves. This space
usually has a map of whatever area the occupants
have claimed as their own, and often more detailed
maps of particular regions. Of course, a table and
chairs are also necessary here.
The second area common to every secret headquarters is the archive. This can be a single computer, a row of ﬁling cabinets, or an older bank of
computer hard drives. Here, the occupants store all
of their knowledge about the area and its inhabitants. These ﬁles are consulted whenever the headquarters’ occupants make their plans, and they are
updated whenever new information appears.
Most secret headquarters also have an equipment
room, storeroom, or armory. This houses all of the
occupants’ tools, which can vary depending upon
their activities. In some cases, this holds the characters’ costumes and weapons. In others, it may store
mundane oﬃce supplies. In still others, it contains
the mystic potion that grants the monks their supernatural strength and speed.

76

D6 Adventure Locations

Some secret headquarters have room for vehicles,
as appropriate for its location. Something on the
shore of a large body of water (perhaps concealed
in a warehouse on a dock) could appropriately have
a hidden boat launch. A headquarters that takes up
the top ﬂoors of an oﬃce building or exists as a
mansion in the country could have a hidden landing pad or aircraft hangar. A team that relies on
cars and motorcycles could have a tube train below
street level that zips members to a distant garage.
Access is another concern for the secret headquarters. Those who need to get in could open a
trap door hidden in shrubbery, take a private elevator, go down a locked ﬂight of stairs, step into the
last stall in the bathroom, slide down a ﬁreman’s
pole, or punch in the proper code on a lock outside an unmarked door (or even some combination
thereof!).
Finally, most secret headquarters have some sort
of security system. Every headquarters needs some
way to know when anyone is approaching and a
way to tell if that person is an occupant or an interloper. This system ranges from a string tied across
the hallway to a small video camera stuck in the

corner of the elevator to an elaborate heat-detection system covering the entire area in and around
the headquarter’s location.
The interior decorating of the headquarters depends on its occupants attitudes. Some may like
bright and modern, while others prefer dark and
gothic. Some might prefer a sterile look, and others
might want the ﬂoors and walls retain some sign of
their origins, like the rough curves of a large cave.
Since most secret headquarters belong to either
villains or crimeﬁghters, the occupants are usually
skilled combatants, whether they are super heroes,
secret agents, or monks. Larger secret headquarters can also employ clerks, scientists, and even
accountants.

Don’t Miss ...
The Covert Action Squad (CAS; see their testing
area in the “Weapons Trial Area” entry) is a littleknown division of the FBI that specializes in counterespionage, search and rescue, antiterrorism, and
hostage retrieval. CAS agents are listed as working
for the FBI’s accounting department, and their real
activities are carefully concealed because they do
not use strictly legal methods or equipment.
The CAS headquarters is an impressive complex
20 meters below the Roxcon Corp. oﬃce building. Roxcon has no idea that this sub-basement exists and has never heard of the CAS. CAS agents
are given a cover identity as employees of one of
Roxcon’s subsidiaries, which has an oﬃce on the
eleventh ﬂoor. Access to the headquarters itself is
through one of the building’s elevators — a concealed button can be pushed, and if the individual’s thumb print matches a registered agent, the
car descends to the sub-basement level. Roxcon’s
own security shows the car arriving at the eleventh
ﬂoor instead, and their security cameras see a prerecorded tape of the individual or individuals entering the subsidiary’s oﬃces. The headquarters also
can be reached by a set of stairs, which are entered
through an old-fashioned phone booth with tinted
windows in the Roxcon main lobby, after dialing
“119” on the phone there.
The headquarters itself has an operations room, a
tactics room, an archive, a surveillance center, sev-

eral oﬃces, and an armory. The operations room,
which is the main portion of the headquarters,
holds several desks with cutting-edge computer
equipment and phone relays, and the staﬀ here
handles messages, relays, and any other communications about ongoing missions.
The tactics room is a large meeting space, with
a single long table surrounded by chairs. The back
wall of this room is a projection screen, so that
images and information can be displayed quickly,
and a intercom phone sits at the center of the table
so that the room’s occupants can conference with
agents in the ﬁeld.
The archive is a small room with a single desk
at its center, and a single self-contained computer
connected to a printer on the desk. Optical drive
backups of every CAS mission and any other information the CAS has gathered are housed in small
drawers built into the room’s walls.
The surveillance center contains more computers, phone systems, and security monitors, and
the staﬀ here tracks everyone entering and exiting
Roxcon and its surroundings. They handle the fake
security footage that Roxcon sees, as well as activating the elevator and stairway entrances, and they
trigger intruder countermeasures, including sleepinducing gas and electriﬁed ﬂoors, when necessary.
The oﬃces are used by CAS operational directors,
and can double as sick rooms or temporary bedrooms when necessary. The armory holds weapons,
bulletproof vests, and other necessary gear — each
CAS agent has a registered ﬁrearm, but any additional equipment is checked out from this room.
Some eﬀort has been made to create a friendly
working environment here. The headquarters has
pictures of city landmarks and award plaques hanging on many of its walls. The ﬂoor is rubber with
raised circles for better traction while the lighting
is recessed and indirect. Furniture is eﬃcient but
comfortable, and the tactics room has wood paneling and plush meeting room chairs. In the oﬃces,
fake windows show views from the subsidiary ofﬁces upstairs, courtesy of small cameras outside the
real windows. The back corner of the operations
room has a microwave, a sink, and a small fridge, so
that agents can bring something to eat during the
long working hours. Restrooms, with showers, are
oﬀ the operations room as well.

Things to Do
 The characters have been summoned for an
interview. If they pass, they may be hired on by the
organization, which means they would get to work
in the headquarters themselves. Even to be invited down for an interview is an honor\ and shows
they’ve already passed the ﬁrst round of tests. But
what lies in store for them now?
 The criminals’ attacks are becoming more vicious, more frequent, and more powerful. If they
are not stopped soon, the entire city will erupt into
chaos, and many lives will be lost. The only problem is — no one knows where to ﬁnd these crooks.
They appear without warning and vanish again just
as suddenly. Clearly they have a headquarters here,
but it must be very well-hidden. The characters
have to ﬁnd it — and quickly.
 The characters have been given the job of
forming a new unit. They are to operate within city
limits only and to avoid notice, even by other authorities. That means they’ll need a headquarters
that’s easily accessible but well-hidden. The department has provided the funds, but they’ve left everything else up to the characters.

Showboat
Nothing says Old World decadence like a showboat. These are not the luxury liners of today, but
the slow, stately paddleboats of the previous century that meandered up and down the Mississippi

and other large rivers. Men and women who can afford the steep prices travel down the Mississippi on
these elegant vessels, drinking, dining, and sometimes gambling in the well-appointed salon and
the impressive grand ballroom. Less aﬄuent travelers buy economy tickets, which lets them take the
riverboat but does not give them access to its top
deck. Of course, where the rich and powerful gather, those who would prey upon them also appear,
and showboats are a favorite haunt of showgirls,
musicians, con artists, and the famous riverboat
gambler. But the fact that these people are out to
steal from, swindle, or seduce the rich only makes
the journey more exciting.
The classic showboat is a paddle-wheel riverboat.
These large, ﬂat-bottomed boats are designed to
move smoothly along rivers, and they are made for
stability rather than speed. Furthermore, since only
the rich can aﬀord ﬁrst-class tickets, showboats are
designed with the rich in mind. Their cabins are
handsomely appointed and spacious, more like elegant hotel rooms that just happen to be on board
a ship. The ballroom is as grand as any hotel’s, and
the salon as elegant as any opera house’s. The food
is excellent, and showboats compete in hiring the

best chefs available. They also provide live entertainment, which ranges from musicians to dancers
to actors. In the salon, a variety of games are available, the most popular being poker for the men and
bridge or whist for the women. Some showboats
hire professional dealers for these games, while others provide tables, cards, and chips and leave the
rest to their guests.
Most showboat guests care little for the world
passing by on either bank. They are far more interested in the world within the riverboat, particularly
their fellow passengers. Showboat passengers love
to gossip among their own class, and look down
upon their inferiors or envy their superiors. Many
take a showboat as a form of vacation, traveling
with close friends and spending all their time in the
ballroom and the salon or walking along the upper
deck. Economy passengers, on the other hand, take
the showboat because it’s faster than walking to
their destination, and a little more stylish, and also
because they hope to get the chance to rub elbows
with their wealthy fellow passengers. This rarely
happens, however, since the ship’s crew is careful
to keep the economy passengers and the ﬁrst-class
passengers separate.

Hello, my
name is...

A showboat is a fascinating setting and great opportunity. Mysteries often occur on showboats —
after all, people from diﬀerent classes, some tossing
money about and others envying that luxury, are
bottled up on a ship with nowhere to go and plenty
of free time to brood or plot. Showboats also offer interesting plot developments, particularly for
young performers who hope to win wealthy patrons, or for travelers to be forced together with old
enemies or old former friends.

Don’t Miss ...
The River Queen is a standard showboat, though
of course her owners claim she is grander than all
the rest. She is a large, ﬂat-bottomed boat with
three decks. The lower deck contains a mix of crew
cabins and work areas, including the engine room.
The middle deck holds economy-class guest cabins.
The upper deck has the more expensive ﬁrst-class
guest cabins, the captain’s rooms, the salon, and
the grand ballroom. Deck chairs and small tables
are placed around the balconies of each deck, and
small lifeboats hang from the roofs of the balconies.
Above the upper deck is the wheelhouse, a small
room with windows on all side, and the large pilot’s wheel at its center. Speaking tubes connect the
wheelhouse to the engine room, the kitchens, and
other areas of the ship. Two massive smokestacks
stick up high above the wheelhouse, on either side
of it and slightly before it. The rear of the ship has
a massive paddlewheel, as wide as the boat itself
and slightly taller, and it is this wheel that moves
the ship along.

Things to See
 Wooden deck chairs painted white
 Wooden tables, covered by ﬁne white linen,
and chairs for dining
 Crystal chandeliers
 Real, green tropical plants, a meter or more
tall, in ornate metal pots

Things to Do
 The National Poker Tournament is about
to begin! As always, it is being held on the River
Queen, the grandest of all paddlewheel riverboats.
This year, one of the player’s characters has been
invited to play! Which is strange, considering that
person isn’t really that good of a poker player. ...
 The characters have been hired on as security on this, the ancient riverboat’s last voyage. It is
sailing back down the Mississippi, and then it will
become a ﬂoating museum permanently moored in
New Orleans’ harbor. But why would the owners
feel they needed extra security? What is there about
this venerable boat that could need protecting?
 The Dutchess, the ﬁrst of the three-story riverboats, has just opened for business. Everyone

wants to take the tour of this impressive new ship.
But the owner is a little worried. He’s sunk a lot of
money into the Dutchess — if anything happens to
her, he’ll be ruined. And some people might prefer
that. So he’s asked the players’ characters to keep
their eyes open for any trouble.

Stadium

recede as they rise, so that the highest seats are also
the farthest away. In many stadiums some of the
lower seats are boxed oﬀ for special groups — often a set of small rooms sits just below the highest
group of seats, and these rooms have fancier accommodations, including comfortable couches, private
restrooms, and fully stocked bars.
Most stadiums have several gates or doors at
ground level, each one leading to elevators, escalators, ramps, or a combination of the three. Since

Sports and Their Skills
Stadiums are fascinating places, particularly for
people-watching. Often people go to a sporting
event less to watch the event itself than to watch
the other spectators. Young and old, rich and barely
scraping by, families and loners: all sorts go to stadiums. Of course, the groups do segregate themselves,
which is also interesting to watch — the rich buy box
seats or front-row season tickets, while the workingclass get seats up in the nosebleed section. Groups
of college students or other young adults cluster together, usually in the cheap seats, while more elderly
attendees huddle together in the back where they
don’t have to walk far to their seats. Families often
go with other families, creating a single large mass,
while loners ﬁnd seats by themselves and sit curled
up to avoid attracting attention.
Stadiums are also interesting because they showcase athletic ability. People pay to watch baseball,
basketball, football, or any other sport, to see the
athletes handling themselves with speed, strength,
and grace. Most sports are competitive, and some
attendees get into that aspect, rooting for their teams
and shouting insults at their rivals. Others use the
event as a chance to get out of the house, either alone
or with others, and to distract themselves from regular concerns. Likewise some people bet on sporting
events and watch each game tensely, hoping to make
money oﬀ a particular team’s success or failure.
Stadiums follow the same basic shape, regardless of their size or the sport (or sports) they feature. Every stadium has a rounded rectangular or
squashed oval ﬂoor plan, with the arena at the center. The arena is easily the largest space in the stadium, and around it on all sides are the seats, which

The following is a selection of sporting activities and the suggested skills used by their
players. Gamemasters should require that the
character has scholar: (speciﬁc sport) in order to
properly use the skills required by that sport.
Otherwise, the character either takes a diﬃculty modiﬁer or must use know-how (if she has it)
as a complimentary multi-action attempt with
a Moderate to Diﬃcult know-how diﬃculty to
ﬁgure out what to do next.
 Baseball: acrobatics (sliding), running,

Hello, my

stadiums are designed to hold large numbers of
people, they have to handle large numbers entering
and exiting all at once, and having so many diﬀerent access points helps distribute the people more
evenly.
Another feature of every stadium is the players
areas. In most cases, these are rooms containing
rows of lockers, divided by benches, plus showers
and lavatory facilities, but sometimes they contain
only a bench and a small restroom, particularly in
smaller stadiums. Nonetheless, every stadium has
some place for the participants to go before and after the event, and these places are close to the arena
and have direct access to it.
There are an open-air stadiums (primarily for
football, soccer, and baseball) and covered ones
(for any kind of sport). If it has a ﬁeld, it might
real grass or artiﬁcial. If it’s more suited for indoor
sports, often basketball, indoor soccer, and hockey
can use the same arena simply by covering the court
with appropriate material.
Lights ﬂooding the ﬁeld with illumination are
expensive additions to the stadium, but they can
extend the time in which the structure can be used
by several hours.

Stadiums are excellent places to hold a clandestine deal or meeting, since with that many people
around, it’s easy to conduct business unnoticed,
and it’s easy to disappear into the crowd. At the
same time, stadiums are also ideal targets because
so many people are gathered in one place for several
hours at a time.

Don’t Miss ...
The Sunburst Stadium is a typical large minor-league open-air stadium and focuses on the
Sunbirds football team. The stadium is a large oval
structure, with the ﬁeld dominating at the center.
Around that are the seats, with various stairs and elevators providing access to them. Beyond the seats
are the hallways, which include several rooms and
spaces for concession stands and souvenir shops.
Information desks are spaced out around the stadium, as are security checkpoints. On the ﬁrst
ﬂoor are the ticket counters (near each entrance),
the manager’s oﬃce, and the main security oﬃce.
Locker rooms are situated under the seats, just oﬀ
of the ﬁeld itself.

 The big game is this weekend, and the players’ character have great seats. But then they hear a
rumor that the game might be cancelled, because
the stadium might be shut down. What’s going on?
The stadium’s been doing great business — every
game has been packed — so why would it be closing? The characters can’t let this happen — nothing
can stand in the way of this weekend’s game!
 A major drug deal is going down this weekend. The players’ characters know where and when
it’ll take place. The problem is, you don’t know
who’s involved — both sides have large organizations and could send almost anyone. The meet is
taking place at the stadium, during a game. It’s perfect cover. With so many people around, how can
the characters possibly keep an eye on everything,
much less ﬁgure out who the dealer is and get there
in time to stop the deal from taking place?
 A madman has taken control of the stadium.
He has a bomb strapped to his chest, and threatens
to detonate it if anyone interferes — and it looks
like the bomb may be powerful enough to level the
entire stadium and kill everyone inside! But the
players’ character can’t just let him get away with
this, especially since there’s no guarantee he won’t
snap and detonate it anyway. The characters have
to get in there and rescue all those people.

People to Meet
Most stadiums have ticket-takers, booth attendants, concessions, grounds crew, maintenance
workers, security, and the manager — in addition

Temple
Few places are as evocative as a temple, particularly an ancient one. Whether large or small, ornate
or spartan, these timeworn ediﬁces are monuments
to religion, faith, and dedication. Temples can be
a refuge for the hunted and the lost, and a bastion
against tyranny. But they can also be the source of
tyranny, the headquarters of a religion determined
to conquer and rule.
Adventurers and scholars often seek out ancient
temples, for a variety of reasons. First, these temples

D6 Adventure Locations

83

Hello, my
name is...

can reveal a great deal about their former (and current) occupants. When dealing with a lost religion,
that faith’s last temple might be the only source of
real knowledge about their beliefs and practices.
Second, ancient temples were often the warehouse
for knowledge in their area, either because the
priests actively gathered information or because it
was the only place people could safely store such
knowledge. If an ancient sickness is sweeping a continent, and the last known outbreak occurred in an
area dominated by a particular religion, the temples
of that religion might have information about the
illness, including possible cures — or how to produce the illness upon command. Finally, temples
were the center of faith and religious devotion,
and in many cultures that meant that worshippers
lavished money upon the temple to demonstrate
their piety. Some ancient temples are ﬁlled with
treasures, including holy artifacts. These could be
worth a fortune in the modern world, as much for
their history as for their materials.
Temples vary widely in size and shape, but each
shares certain features. The most important and largest area in the temple is the worship chamber, and it

84

D6 Adventure Locations

is dedicated to worship of the faith’s major deity or
deities. This layout of the room focuses on an idol,
image, or some representation of the deity. The representation could be an abstract one, like a simple
stretch of white sand, but there is always something
the worshipper can use as a focal point. Most often these rooms contain benches, pews, mats, or
cushions, somewhere for worshippers to sit or kneel
while praying, and an area set aside for the actual
priests, like a raised platform or a screened corner.
Since priests tend to live and work at the temple all
the time, most temples also contain dormitories of
some sort, whether a single large room with bunkbeds along the walls or a series of small bedchambers. Kitchens and dining halls are also common,
as are lecture or meditation rooms where the priests
can study and oﬃces for those in charge.
Depending upon the age of the temple, and
whether it is still actively in use, you are most likely
to encounter priests, worshippers, or scholars while
wandering the site. Even if the temple is no longer active, priests may still keep watch to prevent
looting, and worshippers may visit the ruins to pay
their respects. Scholars, particularly archaeologists

and anthropologists, cluster around ruins and other former temples.
Ancient temples represent not only faith but also
mystery, particularly if their religion is no longer
active or well-known. The temple can provide clues
to some ancient riddle, or treasures from a lost
world, or an entry into a long-forgotten civilization. They can be the goal in a long quest, or the
stepping-oﬀ point for a new adventure.
Temples can have almost as many variables as
there ways of worshiping. The temple can be still in
use, no longer active, long since abandoned, or in
ruins. It can be very visible, largely hidden, or completely lost. Its architecture can match a known culture, like the Aztecs, or it can be completely unique
and even a bit alien. It might be large and solid,
almost a fortress, or small and humble, or open and
designed to blend with its surroundings. Inside, the
trappings can be rich and heavily ornamented, extremely plain, or well-crafted but simple. It may
be the temple to a major religion, or to an ancient
and forgotten god. The priests can be kindly old
men, arrogant young fanatics, or sensuous women.
The temple can be set almost anywhere, from the
middle of the desert to deep in a jungle to the heart
of a large city.

Introducing Temples
When introducing an ancient temple, the
trick is to know its history. What religion created this temple, and when? Who was it dedicated to? What were the goals of the priests?
How did they relate to the people nearby
— did everyone worship at this temple, did
the priests dominate the locals, or did they
hide their presence and refuse visitors? What
treasures were here, and which ones still remain? If the temple is no longer in active use,
when did the priests leave and why? And was
it only the priests who left, or did the temple’s
gods abandon it as well? Knowing all of these
details can help the gamemaster decide which
clues to leave for the players, and make the
temple an interesting location that ﬁts well in
the campaign.

Don’t Miss ...
The House of Lucan is hidden deep within the
jungle and dedicated to a local warrior god. Most of
the locals have long since forgotten Lucan’s name,
though rumors of a strange temple remain. The
temple itself is still intact, and still active, though
its priests rarely leave the temple’s conﬁnes, and do
not discuss their home or their calling when they
encounter strangers.
The House of Lucan is a single long, low building
carved from local limestone and covered in vines
that help it blend into its jungle surroundings. The
massive wooden doors lead into a single large antechamber, where people can prepare themselves
for prayer by dipping their hands into the shallow
wooden bowls against the wall and splashing the
water (or, during certain rites, blood) onto their
face and chest. Past that, the long, wide nave has
rough wooden benches on either side. At the far
end is a low wooden dais, with the altar of Lucan
at the center. To one side of that, a small door leads
into the head priest’s private chamber. On the other
side of the dais is the room that holds Lucan’s armor, helm, and sword, which are brought out for
each service. These are the temple’s greatest treasures and are said to still contain the touch of the
god. The temple also has bedrooms for the priests,
plus a refectory and a kitchen and a small library.
Behind the building is a large clearing, where the
priests practice their ﬁghting skills, with each victory dedicated to Lucan himself.

Things to See
 Religious symbols, statues, and icons made
of wood, ordinary or precious metal, marble, stone,
or another substance important to the deity, possibly encrusted with jewels
 Metal oil lamps or lanterns on metal poles
 Heavy tapestries, colorful if new or faded
with age, depicting abstract designs or signiﬁcant
religious scenes
 Wooden benches, fabric cushions or mats, or
other means of designating places for the faithful

 Large candles on heavy candlesticks, created
from the same material as or from complementary
material to that of the religious symbols
 Books, scrolls, or tables inscribed with information about the religion, its deity or deities, its

 Temples still in use would have furniture
and other appropriate accoutrements in the priests’
personal quarters (cots, dressers, tables, chairs or
benches, lights, eating and cooking utensils, etc.)

Things to Do
 The lost temple has been found at last! Which
means its greatest treasure might soon be recovered
— but by whom? Whoever gets to the treasure ﬁrst
will be famous. The players’ character might be the
ones to ﬁnd it —or they might be hired to protect
its location.
 A man staggers into town, strange purple
welts covering his body. He gasps out “the ... temple ... awakens” and collapses, dead. What did he
mean? And what temple? There are no religious
houses anywhere nearby. At least, none that anyone
can remember.
 The priests of the temple have declared that
their time of waiting is over, and the time of celebration is at hand. They throw open the doors of
the temple and invite everyone to enter and rejoice
with them. This is the ﬁrst time in recorded history
that this has happened — always before this, the
priests have kept to themselves. But now they are
enthusiastically meeting people and showing them
around the temple. It’s a wonderful opportunity to
see the inside of this ancient and holy place. But
what are the priests celebrating, exactly?

People to Meet
Active temples have priests, supplicants, temple guards, and humble workers. Priests have 3D

+2D in willpower and scholar: (religion). Warriorpriests also have 2D+2 to 3D in either Reﬂexes or
Coordination, and up to +2D in brawling, acrobatics, melee combat, or missile weapons. Temple guards
have the same as warrior-priests, plus +1D in throwing and running. Humble workers have at least 2D

in lifting and other necessary skills.
Supplicants have no particular skills
or attribute levels (the generic person

Warehouse

D6 Adventure Locations

As long as people have had stuﬀ, they have also
struggled to house it all. Warehouses are the most
utilitarian manifestation of this desire — a building dedicated solely to storing things. The standard
warehouse of 100 years ago looked remarkably
similar to today’s version, and the warehouse of the
future will probably also be very familiar.
The standard warehouse is, at its core, a large
box-like building, designed to get objects in and
out as eﬃciently as possible. Warehouses traditionally also have utilitarian oﬃces for their workers,
usually sectioned oﬀ to one side; outside of being
traditionally less ornate than their more dedicated
cousins, these are otherwise very similar (see the

“Oﬃce” entry in this book). Unlike retail locations,
warehouses discourage visitors; they are situated
away from standard traﬃc (often in a “warehouse
district” of town), have bare metal walls with no
decoration inside or out, and favor protecting their
merchandise over making people comfortable. As
such, the typical storage area has no climate control
unless the stored product demands it, resulting in
extremely uncomfortable winters and summers, if
the area has such temperature extremes. This seclusion makes the warehouse easier to load and unload
in quiet, but it can also make it a tempting target
for thieves.
The standard small warehouse has one roll-up
garage-like door by the storage area, and traditional
doors into the oﬃce. Larger warehouses may have
multiple or larger entrances to either area, as might
those designed for a speciﬁc purpose, such as one
intended to store large airplane parts. There are
almost always entryways from the oﬃce onto the
warehouse ﬂoor, since those workers are primarily
in charge of buying and selling the merchandise,
inventory control, or security.
The layout of the warehouse ﬂoor primarily depends on what is being stored. In general, ware-

houses have arrangements that ensure every product is accessible, although slow-selling material
may be relegated to an out-of-the-way corner. Thus
a heavy machinery warehouse would be arranged
into wide aisles so that a forklift could transport
any particular piece, while a book redistribution
warehouse would keep its books sorted by company and ISBN.
What a warehouse lacks in beauty, it usually
makes up for in security. Warehouses typically depend on three diﬀerent types of protection: structural integrity, alarms, and guards. All warehouses
rely on a secure construction (usually solid metal
walls and doors — 3D to 4D Toughness, depending on importance). Medium-sized warehouses
generally have an alarm system; thwarting this requires an Easy security check for poor or ill-kept
warehouses, Moderate for standard important
buildings, and Diﬃcult for those storing the most
valuable and expensive equipment. Finally, larger
warehouses often have at least one security guard
on hand at all hours, and multiple guards might
watch exceptionally large or valuable sites. To move
palettes of product or equipment, large warehouses
utilize forklifts.

Riding Forklift
Basically a heavy-duty motor on wheels,
with a seat directly over the engine and two
movable prongs (forks) in the front, the forklift
makes multiple tiers of shelving in a warehouse
possible, as well as enabling workers to move
much more than they could on their own or
with a simple, pushed pallet jack.
Move: 5 (3.6 kph)
Passengers: 1
Toughness: 6D (does not protect those in
an open cab)
Maneuverability: -1D
Scale Value: 4
Price: Heroic
Warehouses can be customized fairly easily to suit
diﬀerent needs; the only general requirements are
storage areas and oﬃce space. Thus to mimic a smaller warehouse with the map, simply use the Secondary
Storage area as the whole warehouse; the doors connecting the Primary and Secondary Storage areas
would instead open to the street or parking lot.

Don’t Miss ...
The Peachtree Road Business Facility, built in
1978, dwarfs many other warehouses in the city.
Its primary storage area provides over 6,000 square
meters of space, not counting the oﬃces and other
rooms, while secondary storage gives another 1,000
square meters. The warehouse’s current client is
KitchiBath Pros, a major chain kitchen and bath
ﬁxtures retailer. They use the warehouse to store
the region’s supply of bathtubs, countertops, toilets, and the like. (The buﬀ foreman, 34-year-old
Al Marshall, jokes that if a ﬁght broke out here, it
would literally involve the kitchen sink.)
The Peachtree Facility usually loads product into
itself via the primary storage area garage door oﬀ
the main room, while the loading dock is typically
used as a staging area to prepare items for shipping
to individual stores. Because the loading dock is so
close to the oﬃces and other eyes, sneaking into the

warehouse would be much easier via the primary
or secondary storage entrances (Easy sneak check),
rather than the loading dock (Diﬃcult).
The warehouse’s records are computerized and
accessible via any terminal, though they are password protected (Moderate tech to hack in). The
warehouse is also about 50% larger than it needs
to be, so while it would be diﬃcult to sneak merchandise out, it would be relatively trivial to get
objects in ... especially if the computer record could
be modiﬁed to account for the mystery parcels.

Things to See
 Cardboard boxes, wooden crates, or metal
barrels
 Flat pallets constructed of wooden slats or
molded from plastic, about one to 1.2 meters on

Standard warehouse employees, managers, and

working on the warehouse ﬂoor have at least a pip

should have +2 to +1D in business. A guard would
have at least two skill dice divided among brawling, marksmanship, search, and security; the security
guard listed in the D6 Adventure Rulebook (page
126) is a good, if overqualiﬁed, representation.

Things to Do
 The players’ characters require an essential,
rare machine part that has been obsolete for a decade. They ﬁnd paper evidence indicating that one
particular warehouse might contain the item, but
the foreperson refuses to search for it since the
computer has no record of the item. Can they ﬁgure out a way to sneak or bluﬀ their way in, ﬁnd the
dusty part amid the huge warehouse, and escape
unnoticed?
 An unsavory villain is hiding in a warehouse
at night, and it’s vital he be stopped ... quickly! Can
the players’ characters thwart him amid the dangers
of darkness, blind alleys, teetering boxes, and the
unfettered forklift? And if it’s true the warehouse
was once used by the government to store arcane
artifacts, what happens if the villain ﬁnds one?

to get their weapons repaired if necessary. It’s also a
good opportunity to see what other locals use, and
how their aim is, which can give people an edge if
they ever wind up trading bullets with each other.
The weapons trial area can serve as the place examine and try out new weapons. This is where a
gun manufacturer will take its newest automatic
pistol to see if it’s good enough to mass-produce. It’s
also where an evil genius will test his wrist-mounted
ﬂamethrower to be sure he can fry anyone who attacks him. Because of this, the local weapons trial
area is the best place to ask for information about
the latest unusual weapons. Even if that weapon
wasn’t ﬁred at that location, the people are weapons
experts, and if anyone heard of such a unique weapon they’d remember it and want to talk about it.
Most weapons trial areas are part of an organization. In a few cases, weapons trial areas are independently owned, particularly if they specialize in
more exotic weapons. (These might even be hidden from the local law enforcement community.)
Otherwise they belong to a large group and are
only used by members of that group. For example,
a police force generally has its own ﬁring range and
its own gunsmiths. A federal agency or a private security ﬁrm similarly would have its own. Likewise,
gun clubs, by their nature, have their own weapons trial area, and these are open to anyone who
pays for membership. This
makes them better places to
meet other locals interested
in guns but worse places to
bring specialized weapons or
test out new gadgets.
Every weapons trial area is
built around its ﬁring range.
Every area has at least one,
and larger areas may have
several ranges, typically one for pistols and another for riﬂes, plus perhaps another for exotics. The
setup is always the same: a long room with a row
of booths across one end and a row of targets at
the other. Whether the targets are clipped on or
computer-generated, and the weapons are lasers,
crossbows and stake-launchers, or Wild West pistols, this layout remains the same for all ranges.
Most weapons trial areas also have an examination room, where weapons can be disassembled

Weapons
Trial Area
Almost every cop movie or secret agent ﬁlm has
a scene on the ﬁring range. Why? Because it’s a
chance to show oﬀ new weapons, to highlight the
character’s skill with ﬁrearms — or to show the skill
of the bad guys. Weapons trial areas are important
for anyone who works with ﬁrearms or experimental weapons, and any good cop, ﬁeld agent, or soldier puts in regular hours at such a place. This gives
them the chance to try diﬀerent weapons, to perfect
their aim and ease with their preferred weapon, and

and checked for damage. Those areas that supply
guns also have an armory, with unloaded weapons
hanging on racks against the wall. (These place even
require that visitors use the supplied weapons instead of bringing their own.) Places that create new
weapons have weapons labs, where weaponsmiths
design and then craft new destructive devices.
Weapons trial areas operate under certain rules
for the protection of the users. For example, the
men and women here have all come to shoot guns,
and all have guns with live ammunition, but the
ﬁrst rule of the range is never point a weapon at
another person. That makes confrontations very
tense, because there’s the potential for a deadly
ﬁreﬁght.
Weapons trial areas can be located just about
anywhere — in a city, on the outskirts of a town, or
in some secluded location. They might be housed
within a larger structure, like a building or a compound, or oﬀ on its own. Some openly state their
business, with a sign above the door, while others are the type of place only certain people know
about, and even fewer are allowed to enter.

Don’t Miss ...
The Civic Gun Club is a cover for the Covert
Action Squad (CAS; see their headquarters in the
“Secret Headquarters” entry). Every member of the
club is a CAS agent, though many ﬁctitious members have been created to prevent suspicion. The
gun club owns a building outside the city limits,
where its members can ﬁre their guns without violating any civic ordinances. The largest section of
the building is devoted to its three ﬁring ranges —
one for handguns, one for riﬂes, and one for exotic
weapons. Beside the ranges is the weapons room,
which holds the club’s latest acquisitions (new
weapons the CAS is examining for possible use) on
racks against the wall. Past that is the examination
room, and behind that are the weapons labs. The
surveillance room, near the front entrance, holds
the club’s security equipment, and between that
room and the front door is the security checkpoint.
The weapons lab has a concealed escape exit, which
leads out to a parking lot behind the building.

Reloading Ammunition
Reloading a case requires the repair: ﬁrearms skill, and it cannot be done untrained; the character
must have at least one additional pip in the skill. With proper equipment, a character can reload about
50 rounds every hour. When a character attempts to reload a bullet, he generates one total per clip
(Character Points may be spent). The standard diﬃculty number is 13.
Reloading has both beneﬁts and drawbacks. It is possible, by adding an extra measure of propellant or
two, to improve damage value or accuracy of a bullet. Bonuses to accuracy are added to the ﬁrearms skill
total when in combat. The process can also increase the likelihood of misﬁres.
When generating the total for improved ammunition, consult the following chart to determine the
eﬀects, which relate to all bullets reloaded in the same clip.

Characters who only wish to reload the bullets and not improve them in anyway should ignore the
chart. Any amount over the base diﬃculty could indicate a reduction in the amount of time taken to
reload the lot (at the gamemaster’s option).

Things to Do
 The players’ characters have been sent down
to get tested on the newest concealable pistol. But
when they enter the weapons trial area, the place
is deserted — which is strange, since there’s always
someone on duty here. Then they notice that the
armory’s been cleaned out. Somebody has robbed
the place! Worse, not all of those weapons are public knowledge — nor are they all strictly legal. The
characters have to ﬁgure out who took them, and
then ﬁnd the culprit and get everything back. And
soon.
 This area’s criminal organization has its own
building where its men can go and practice with
their weapons. It’s the perfect place to identify gang
members and ﬁnd out what they’re up to — assuming the characters can get inside the structure. The
security is very tight, and there’s no way they’d let a
cop or a fed into the building.
 The player’s characters have heard rumors
that a new handheld laser is being tested soon. The
weapon, if it works, could be worth a fortune —
including to the characters. The only problem is,
it’s being held in the Feds’ own weapons trial area.
That means breaking in through federal security,
ﬁnding the laser, and getting back out unseen.

up to the posts slack and are tightened by inserting
a metal bar through the center of the turnbuckle
and twisting the bar. Turnbuckles are very solid and
can be quite dangerous if exposed. For this reason a
large pad covers each one — most of the time.
Then there are the ropes. Every wrestling ring
has three ropes on each side. Ropes have gone from
being mainly adornments used to keep the action
in the ring area to integral parts of a wrestler’s repertoire. Ropes are usually made up of steel cable
covered with a thick padding. The tightening of the
ropes with the turnbuckles gives them their spring
(+2 to acrobatics rolls when using the skill) and lets
the wrestler bounce on, oﬀ, and over them.
The mat is the canvas ﬂoor of the ring, but it is
much more than that. Underneath the ring itself
are springs designed to give some bounce to the
mat. Through the combined use of turnbuckles,
ropes, and a spring-loaded mat, professional wrestlers manage to pull oﬀ their eye-popping stunts.
Around the base of the ring is a cover sometimes
decorated with a wrestling logo that hides the ring’s
underneath portion. It also acts as a good place to
hide things participants are not allowed to have in
the ring (at least according to the oﬃcial rules).
Outside of the ring itself is what’s called the “ring
area.” This area is separated from the crowd by a
steel barrier. Inside the ring area are often the announcer’s table, the
ring bell, timekeeper, announcers, ring
steps, and various
camera crews (if the
event is televised).

Wrestling Ring
The squared circle, as it’s aﬀectionately called, is
the center of all (well, most) of professional wrestling’s action. What may seem to be just three sets
of ropes tied to a few steel posts is actually a carefully designed structure built to enhance the wrestling experience.
To describe a generic wrestling ring, let’s do a
top down, inside out approach. First, there are the
steel corner posts. These are the ring’s anchors and
keep it steady with all the action going on inside
and out.
Next are the turnbuckles. Each rope is connected
to the ring posts via a turnbuckle. Ropes are hooked

Wrestling Ring Variations
Since most wrestling rings are pretty generic, this
section describes a variety of variations on the standard wrestling ring. This does not include events
like “tables” or “tables, ladders, and chairs” matches
that revolve around bring things “into” a standard
ring.

Barbed Wire
A particularly vicious type of wrestling match
is the barbed wire match. In this match, the ring

ropes are actually replaced with lengths of barbed
wire stretched between the turnbuckles. Other
than the obvious eﬀect of cutting anyone coming
into contact with the wire, it also grounds high-ﬂying wrestlers, as the barbed wire doesn’t give them
the same footing or support a standard ring rope
would.

ory. Cell matches are known for their ferocity and
for wrestlers escaping to the outside of the ring and
climbing the cell itself. The cell’s top then becomes
a makeshift ring area where a wrestler could end up
plummeting ﬁve meters to the ﬂoor below.

Cage

The king of all hardcore matches, the Exploding
Death Match combines the barbed wire match with
explosions. The exploding portions of the ring are
sometimes placed in the corners on the turnbuckles, or outside the ring itself on the ﬂoor around it
in the ring area. Coming into contact with any of
these areas cause them to explodes, doing serious
harm (damage 3D) to the wrestler.

In a cage match, the ring is surrounded by a cage
usually made of chain-link material (like a fence)
with a steel support ring at the top and a door in
one corner, but a few shows have had elaborate
steel crossbar cages, which are easier to climb. The
idea behind a cage match is to be the ﬁrst person to
escape to the outside via the door or by going up
and over the cage itself.

Cell
A cell match has the same basic principle as a
cage match, except there is a roof on top of the cage
preventing anyone from leaving — at least in the-

Exploding Death Match

Multiple Rings
While not a variation in itself, some events have
two or more rings are placed side by side, and the
wrestling action ﬂows between them. Sometimes
multiple rings have been paired with cages or cells
to create truly diﬀerent wrestling experiences.

Pole
In this match, a
pole is placed in one
or more corners of the
ring and the ﬁrst person to reach the item
on the pole wins the
match. A variation of
this theme has a weapon of some sort hanging from the pole, and
the ﬁrst person to grab
it is allowed to use it
on his opponent.

Scaffold
One of the most
dangerous of all matches, a scaﬀold match
consists of a regular
wrestling ring with a

Zoo
Zoos became popular in the late nineteenth century as public attractions, even though they have
been around in one form or another for centuries.
Historically, a number of monarchs have kept private zoos, especially in Rome and the Far East.
However, these zoos, as well as most nineteenthcentury zoos, were not much more than rows of
cages. Mortality rate of the animals, and handlers,
was fairly high.
Modern zoos use open habitats to house most of
the animals. These habitats are separated from the
public by guardrails and sometimes deep trenches
or moats. Vegetation and rocks give a natural look
and feel, though the animals can usually retreat to
a den, which is far more stark, inside the exhibit. If
the zoo is large, the den might have a viewing area
that allows the public to see the animals in their
retreat as well. Less aggressive animals may have a
simple fence or short wall dividing them and their
camera-wielding predators. Goats, sheep, and easily domesticated animals are often housed in fenced
“petting zoos,” where children might get to touch
and feed them.
Exceptions to this kind of animal display exist
for creatures that can more easily escape or need a
special climate. Birds are normally kept in a sanctuary covered by a massive cage or net, which might
have a lagoon for water birds. Reptiles are kept in a
structure with glass-walled rooms, monkeys in large
areas or cages with trees or tree-like structures, and

bats in an enclosed building with an observation
section at one end. Additionally, some zoos have
penguins, otters, seals, and walruses, which require
an aquatic habitat with islands and ponds. In rare
cases, zoos may have dolphins, whales, and displays
of exotic ﬁsh.
Wide, concrete or asphalt walkways twist and
turn between and around hubs of habitats in the
modern zoo. Exhibits are usually grouped together
by species, such as big cats, bears, elephants, small
mammals, aquatics, and similar categories, or by
region, such as Africa and Asia. There is generally
a snack bar or restaurant, gated ticket center, and
administrative building with educational facilities,
security, and ﬁrst aid. Unseen by the public is typically a veterinary clinic where most any kind of
medical procedure can be performed. These facilities are either in areas obscured by foliage or living
plant walls, encircled by habitats, or occasionally
underground, linked by tunnels.
Zoos are a locale that is packed with scores of
innocent bystanders; to make situations even more
interesting, there are hundreds, even thousands, of
wild and exotic animals in the mix as well. With the
proliferation of daft Australian wildlife show hosts,

numerous exotic creatures have been snatched,
tranquilized, boxed up, and placed in sleepy suburban zoos. The idea of an encounter with a rare
Amazonian snake so poisonously lethal that organs
shrivel at the mere mention of the name now become a lot more believable
On a daily basis, the ingredients for sheer disaster such as a church group and a lion, two natural
enemies, are kept apart and safe while maintaining
an educational, family experience. Most common
problems such as medical emergencies, extreme
weather, power outages, and so are usually contained. It generally takes a very clever animal, a miscreant presence, or an inept zoo employee to release
an animal into the general populace. Nonetheless,
animal escapes into the keeper areas behind the exhibits do happen fairly frequently.
Adventures surrounding zoos in a nonsupernatural setting often involve animal theft, by greedy individuals meeting a black market request or by animal
activists seeking to “free” the creatures from their
captivity. In mystical or science ﬁction settings, circumstances in the zoo can be far more unusual. For
instance, masters of mind control may seek animal
familiars to aid them in their goals. Similarly, what

D6 Adventure Locations

95

Hello, my

appears to be a mundane bear might actually be a
shapeshifter. For an espionage twist, the creatures
could have been taken from dozens of countries,
which opens the possibility for the involvement of
many cultures and governments. Discovering the
existence of a stolen panda in the local zoo may
enrage a Chinese ambassador, and it becomes the
character’s responsibility to resolve the incident.
There are a number of environmental and political issues that can be blended into zoo encounters.
Zoos in modern day are often educational platforms for wildlife protection, repopulation of endangered species, and conservation of habitats such
as the rain forest. Thus, studious scientists, opportunistic corporate interests, and the lunatic fringe
of activism all frequent this location and could possibly cause trouble because of their enthusiasm for
their cause.

Things to See
 Stone benches
 Metal or plastic signs with information about
the animals or directions to other areas of the zoo
 Sturdy, green metal garbage barrels
 Walkie-talkies

etc.)

In modern zoos, zoologists make up most — if
not all — of the staﬀ. They have 2D in all characteristics except Knowledge at 3D and have brawling:
