OpenD6 SPACE SRD RULEBOOK
=========================


Introduction
============

This book provides the fundamentals necessary to play in nearly
any type of science ﬁction setting using West End Games' famous D6
System roleplaying game rules.

If you're reading this book, you are probably quite familiar with
roleplaying games. In case you need a refresher or to explain it to your
friends, we suggest telling them that this is an interactive storytelling
game wherein they play the part of major characters in the story. If
that rouses their curiosity, let them read this introduction.

You might also want to start with this introduction if you've roleplayed 
before getting this book but it wasn't with the D6 System.


What Is a Roleplaying Game?
---------------------------

A roleplaying game is very much like improvisational acting or
interactive storytelling -- but with rules. Many video games are like
this, and there are plenty of online interactive worlds, so chances are
good that you know what a roleplaying game is about. This roleplaying
game, however, doesn't need any expensive equipment, special software
or cartridges, or a connection to the Internet.


What Do I Need to Play?
-----------------------

To play this game, you need this book, some paper, something to
write with, some six-sided dice, a lot of imagination, and a group of
people, one of whom is willing to act as the guiding force in the game.
This person is called many things, but "gamemaster" serves well as 
shorthand for someone who presents information about the game setting,
creates obstacles for the other players to overcome, takes the part of
the people the players encounter, and adjudicates the rules. The rest of
the group, simply called "the players," take on roles of major characters
in the story that they and the gamemaster create together.

The stories are called "adventures," or "scenarios." Very short 
adventures, usually encompassing only one or two obstacles to a simple goal,
are referred to as "encounters." A series of encounters can become an
adventure, while a series of adventures can turn into a campaign. This
book contains a chapter (called "Adventure Tips") on how to come up
with adventures.


Where Do I Go Next?
-------------------

Will you be you joining a game where everyone else knows how
to play, and you don't have a lot of time to learn the rules? Read
"Character Basics" and then ﬂip to the character templates. Ask the 
gamemaster which one or ones you can use. (These are also available 
for downloading from the West End Games Web site.) Fill in the template 
as you learned from Chapter 1, then take the sheet to the game session 
and start playing.

The rest of the players will teach the details as you go along.
Do you have some time to learn the rules, but you don't want to
be the gamemaster? Read all of the chapters up through the "Healing" 
chapter. In this introduction is a solitaire adventure that will get
you started on the basics; the rest of the chapters ﬁll in more details.
Then skip to the "Equipment" chapter. If you want to play someone
with the ability to manipulate the energy of universe, you'll also need
to read the "Metaphysics" chapter.

Do you want to be the gamemaster, with all its responsibilities
and privileges? You'll need to read this entire book, or at least through
the "Healing" chapter and skim the rest. Then use the "Adventure Tips"
chapter to design your own scenario. After that, invite some friends
over, introduce them to creating characters, and have fun!


System Overview
===============

This overview provides basic concepts essential to roleplaying with
the D6 System. The concepts presented herein are further explained
in the rest of this book, and an introductory adventure will give you a
chance to try out what you've learned here.

### Reality ###

The D6 System rules are not meant to reﬂect the real world's reality. 
Rather, they have been designed to model ﬁction reality, the reality 
of stories, television shows, comic books, and movies. Gamemasters who 
want to use this system to describe the real world will need to add 
their own modiﬁers and limits.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Making Actions
--------------

Each player has a character with attributes and skills that describe
how well he or she can perform various actions. Attributes represent
a character's innate abilities, while skills are speciﬁc applications of
those abilities.

Most game mechanics in the D6 System involve rolling some six-sided
dice. A die code associated with each attribute and skill represents how
good the character is in that area. A die code associated with a weapon
shows how much harm it can cause. The larger the number, the more
experienced, trained, or naturally adept your character is, or the more
deadly the weapon, or the more useful the equipment.

Each die code indicates the number of six-sided dice you roll when
you want your character to do something (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, etc.),
and sometimes an amount (called pips) of "+1" or "+2," which is added
to the total result you roll on the dice.

Example: *If your character's Strength attribute is 3D+1, when you
have her try to lift a cargo container, you would roll three dice and add
1 to the total to get her result.*

To represent the randomness of life (and the tons of little modiﬁers
that go along with it), every time you roll dice, make sure that one of
them is of a different color than the others. This special die is the Wild
Die, and it can have some interesting effects on your dice total. (If you
only have one die to roll, then that die is the Wild Die.)

If the Wild Die comes up as a 2, 3, 4, or 5, add the result to the
other dice normally. If the Wild Die comes up as a 6, this is a Critical
Success. Add the 6 to your other dice results and roll the Wild Die
again. As long as you roll a 6, you keep adding the 6 and you keep
rolling. If you roll anything else, you add that number to the total and
stop rolling. If the Wild Die comes up as a 1 on the ﬁrst roll, this is a
Critical Failure. Tell the gamemaster, who will let you know whether
or not to add it to your total.

The higher you roll, the better your character accomplishes the task
at hand. When your character tries doing something, the gamemaster
decides on the required skill and a difficulty based on the task's 
complexity. The gamemaster doesn't usually tell you the difficulty number
you need to equal or beat to succeed. He often won't inform you which
tasks are easier and which are harder, though he might give you hints.
("Hmmm, catching your grappling hook around that small outcropping
is going to be pretty hard . . .") The gamemaster then uses the rules to
interpret the die roll and determine the results of the action.


Taking Damage
-------------

To describe how much injury a character can sustain, the gamemaster 
decides on one of two ways of determining how much damage
a character can take: Body Points or Wounds.

With the Body Points system, each character has a certain number
of Body Points (which are ﬁgured out when you create your character).
You subtract the amount of damage the attacker rolls for his weapon
from the total number of Body Points your character has.

With the Wounds system, each character has a certain number
of Wounds. You roll your character's Strength while the attacker rolls
damage. Compare the difference between the damage and the Strength
roll a Wounds level chart; the chart lets you know how many Wounds
your character gets from the attack.

In either system, when your character has no more Body Points or
Wounds left, she's toast.


Improving Rolls
---------------

In addition to scores for a character's attributes and skills, she
has Fate Points and Character Points. You can spend these points in
particularly difficult and heroic situations.

When you spend a Character Point, you get to roll one extra die
when you character tries to complete a task. You may choose to spend
a Character Point after you've made a roll (in case you want to improve
your result).

When you spend a Fate Point, that means your character is using
all of her concentration to try to succeed. You may spend a Fate Point
only before any die rolls are made. Doing so doubles the number of
dice you'd normally roll, usually for one round and one action only,
though the gamemaster may allow players to spend more Fate Points
in particularly challenging moments. This allows the character to do
one action really well.

Once a Character Point or Fate Point is used, it's gone. You gain
more Character Points at the end of a game for completing goals and
playing well. You may get back Fate Points at the end of the game if
they were used at a brave, heroic, or climactic moment.


Try It Out!
-----------

Now that you have the basics down, let's try out a short scenario.
First, you'll need a character. On the next page, you'll ﬁnd a template.
Most of the game characteristic information is ﬁlled in. The attributes
and skills are listed in two columns on the left-hand side of the page.
The attributes names -- Agility, Strength, Knowledge, Perception,
Mechanical, Technical, and Metaphysics -- are printed in bold above the
skill names. There are more skills in the game than the ones listed on
this sheet, but these are the ones commonly associated with the type
of profession this template is supposed to represent.

In the center column below the gray line, are some more characteristics. 
Fate Points and Character Points show the number of these
special roll-improving bonuses your character currently has. This quick
encounter doesn't require using any of these.

In the far right column, you'll see Advantages, Disadvantages,
Special Abilities, and a description of your character. These give you
an idea about the kind of character that you're playing. The equipment
paragraph lists the items your character can use during the game.
Below the description of the character, you'll ﬁnd "Funds" and
"Credits," which are two similar methods of measuring how much
wealth your character can usually get at without too much difficulty.
On the next line is "Strength Damage," which shows how much harm
your character can cause with brute force. Next to Strength Damage is
"Move." This characteristic lists the number of meters your character
can easily walk in ﬁve seconds.

Below that are Body Points, Wound levels, and the related Body
Point ranges for your character. Each of these represents how much
injury your character can take. This short adventure won't use Wounds
or the Body Points range, so you can ignore them. Instead, you only
need to use your Body Points number.

### Already Have a Character? ###

If you already have a D6 System character -- from another
D6 System game or because you created a new one using the
rules in this book -- you can still play this adventure. Simply
skip to the "Station Visit" section and follow the directions.

    Mortally Wounded (1-2)
    Dead (0)

Now that you can ﬁnd your way around a character template, let's
ﬁll in the missing game characteristics. To keep it easy, pick seven skills
that you want your character to have experience or training in. Look at
the die code next to the attribute that the ﬁrst skill is listed under, and
add one to the number in front of the "D." Write this new die code next
to the skill. Do this for each of the seven skills you picked.

Example: *If you decided to put 1D in climb/jump, your score for
climb/jump would be your Strength score plus one, or 4D+1.
Then ﬁll in the top of the sheet, if you'd like, with your character's
name and other details.*

In addition to your character sheet, you'll need a pencil and some
six-sided dice, one of which should be a different color or size than
the others. This special die is your Wild Die. As you go through this
scenario, don't read the sections in order. Instead, start with number
1, make a selection, and read the section where your selection tells you
to go. Keep doing that until you get to section 15, which is the end.
Then you'll be ready for your ﬁrst D6 Space adventure!


Station Visit
=============

### 1 ###

After a long voyage you like a little relaxation -- like a holo-boxing
session at the station gym... or maybe a long swim, if they have a pool.
As soon as you get off the ship, you ﬁnd a room on station, change
into exercise clothes, and head out. As your ship came in at an odd
hour, there aren't many people on the promenade, and the stores only
show their auto-displays. You pause in front of one, realizing that the
man a few meters from you isn't also out for a late-night stroll. You're
being sized up.

*Before you decide what to do, let's ﬁnd out who goes ﬁrst: go to 12.*


### 2 ###

You rolled a Critical Failure on the Wild Die. Take away the one and 
your highest number. Read the result on the remaining die, and add any 
pips if your Perception die code included them. (If you're using the
Bounty Hunter sample character, then you add 1 to the number on the die.)

*Go to 5.*


### 3 ###

The man seems shaken by your talk. He
opens his mouth to say something, then
merely spits at you and slinks off.

*Go to 13.*


### 4 ###

Looks like the stalker anticipated your move, because he steps out 
of the way just as your ﬁst is about to connect with his face. "You 
ain't much of a bounty hunter," he scoffs. "You can't be the one that 
brought my brother in." He shoves you for good measure and stomps off 
down the promenade.

*Go to 13.*


### 5 ###

The stalker must have had a plan in mind before starting to approach
you. Before you can react, he rushes forward to punch you, yelling,
"You scum bounty hunter! I'm going to get you for what you did to
my brother!" His wild swing connects with your stomach, causing you
to stagger a step. Let's ﬁnd out how much that's going to hurt. Your
ability to resist damage, called your damage resistance total, equals the
Armor Value of any protection you're wearing (like your coat) plus
any other modiﬁers. Since there are no other modiﬁers, your damage
resistance total equals 1 (which is the Armor Value of the coat). Your
adversary did four points of damage with his ﬁst. So, the total amount
of injury you take equals the tough's damage total minus your damage
resistance total, or three points. Subtract three points from the total
number of Body Points you have.
That's not even enough to knock the wind out of you. Now it's
your turn.

*If you want to talk him out of his intentions to harm you, go
to 7.*

*If you think he'll only listen to force, go to 9.*


### 6 ###

You rolled a Critical Success on the Wild Die. Add the 6 to the
total of the other dice, and roll only the Wild Die again. As long as
you get a 6 on the Wild Die, keep adding that 6 to the total and roll 
the die again. If you get any other number - even a 1 - simply add that 
number to the total you already have. (If you're using the Bounty Hunter
sample character, then you add a 1 to the ﬁnal total.)

*Go to 10.*


### 7 ###

You stop and stare through slitted eyes at the man as he approaches you. 
"Some reason you're following me, sir? You're the bounty hunter that 
threw my brother in jail, ain't you?" spits the man in a gruff voice. 
"I want your hide." "If I got your brother, what makes you think you can 
get me? Let's be reasonable here. If you've got a problem with what
happened to your brother, take it up with the authorities he's in
custody with. Why don't we ﬁnd a bar and I buy you a drink?"

Look at your character sheet and ﬁnd intimidation (under Knowledge)
or persuasion (under Perception) If you put extra dice in either of these,
look at the die code next to the skill name. If you didn't, then look at
the die code of its governing attribute. Take a number of dice equal to
the number in front of the "D" of whichever one you're using; make
sure one of those dice is the Wild Die. Roll the dice. If the Wild Die
is a 1, take it away as well as the highest die and add the rest of them.
If the Wild Die is a 6, add the 6, reroll the Wild Die, and keep adding
and rerolling as long you get a 6 (otherwise, just add the number to
the rest of the total). If it's anything else on the Wild Die, add together
the results of all of the dice.

*If the total on the dice is greater than or equal to 15, go to 3.*

*If the total on the dice is less than 15, go to 14.*


### 8 ###

You quickly approach the stalker and give him a quick and sharp
jab on the jaw. He looks at you with surprise, then anger. "I'll get you
next time, bounty hunter!" he screams as he runs off.

That was an unpleasant encounter. Not unusual, considering your
work, but nothing you ever enjoy no matter how many times it happens. 
You decide to return your room and get a little rest instead of
risking another encounter.

*Go to 13.*


### 9 ###

You're not going to waste any more time with this guy. A little 
violence ought to shake him up enough to leave you alone. Look at your
character sheet and ﬁnd brawling. If you put extra dice in this skill, look
at the die code next to the skill name. If you didn't, then look at the die
code of the governing attribute, Agility. Take a number of dice equal
to the number in front of the "D" of whichever one you're using; make
sure one of those dice is the Wild Die. Roll the dice. If the Wild Die
is a 1, take it away as well as the highest die and add the rest of them.
If the Wild Die is a 6, add the 6, reroll the Wild Die, and keep adding
and rerolling as long you get a 6 (otherwise, just add the number to the
rest of the total). If it's anything, else on the Wild Die, add together
the results of all of the dice.

*If the total on the dice is greater than or equal to 5, go to 8.*

*If the total on the dice is less than 5, go 4.*


### 10 ###

You're a little quicker at assessing the situation than the stalker
is. You get the chance to do something before he can react. What do
you want to do?

*If you want to talk him with him, go to 7.*

*If you think he'll only listen to force, go to 9.*


### 11 ###

Since you didn't get a 1 or 6 on the Wild Die, simply total the dice
and add any pips if your Perception die code included them. (If you're
using the Bounty Hunter character, then you add a 1 to the total on
the dice.)

*If the Perception total is greater than or equal to 6, go to 10.*

*If the Perception total is less than 6, go to 5.*


### 12 ###

To ﬁnd out who's got the faster reactions in this combat encounter,
look at your character sheet and ﬁnd "Perception" and the die code next
to it. Take a number of dice equal to the number in front of the "D";
make sure one of those dice is the Wild Die (and differently colored
from the rest). So, if the die code is 3D+1, you would have two regular
dice and one Wild Die. Roll the dice and then select the option that
matches the results on the Wild Die.

*If you rolled a 1 on the Wild Die, go to 2.*

*If you rolled a 6 on the Wild Die, go to 6.*

*If you rolled any number other than a 1 or a 6, go to 11.*


### 13 ###

That was an unpleasant encounter. Not unusual, considering your
work, but nothing you ever enjoy no matter how many times it hap-
pens. You decide to return your room and get a little rest instead of
risking another encounter.

*Go to 15.*


### 14 ###

He sneers at your ridiculous statement, and he rushes forward to
punch you. His wild swing connects with your stomach, causing you
to stagger a step. Let's ﬁnd out how much that's going to hurt. Your
ability to resist damage, called your damage resistance total, equals the
Armor Value of any protection you're wearing (like your coat) plus
any other modiﬁers. Since there are no other modiﬁers, your damage
resistance total equals 1 (which is the Armor Value of the coat). The
stranger did four points of damage with his ﬁst. So, the total amount
of injury you take equals your adversary's damage total minus your
damage resistance total, or three points. Subtract three points from
the total number of Body Points you have. That's not even enough to
knock the wind out of you.

"You ain't much of a bounty hunter," he scoffs. "You can't be the
one that brought my brother in." He shoves you for good measure and
stomps off down the promenade.

*Go to 13.*


### 15 ###

In a full-length adventure, you'd have a lot more choices, but hopefully, 
this short adventure gave you an idea of how the game works. If
you're unsure, go back through the scenario, picking different answers
and, probably, making different die rolls. When you think you're ready,
you can use the Bounty Hunter character to play in other adventures
with your friends, or you can go to Chapter 1 and learn how to make
your own character. Happy adventuring!


Key Terms
=========

These deﬁnitions provide you with a general idea of what each term
means; they are described in more detail within the book.Terms italicized
within each deﬁnition refer to another entry within this glossary.
action: A task that the character undertakes or something that the
character does, like give a speech or climb a wall.
active defense value: A number the character gets when concentrating on 
getting out of the way of an attack.

* **Armor Value:** A die code representing the amount of protection a
defensive covering provides. It can help determine the damage resistance
total. This term is sometimes abbreviated AV.

* **Body Points:** One of two ways of indicating the amount of injury a
character can sustain, listed as a number. The damage total is subtracted
from the character's current Body Point total. May be used alone or
with Wounds.

* **Character Point:** A bonus representing a surge of adrenaline or
that extra luck the main characters of a story seem to have. Allows the
user to roll an additional Wild Die.

* **combat difficulty:** A number representing how challenging it is to
attack someone or something. It equals the active defense value or the
passive defense value.

* **complementary skill:** A skill whose results could aid in the use
of another skill.

* **creation points:** Points used when designing a character to purchase
die codes in game characteristics or other features that represent the
character's abilities, experience, and background.

* **Critical Failure:** A result, represented by a 1, on the Wild Die that
indicates something bad has occurred.

* **Critical Success:** A result, represented by a 6, on the Wild Die
that indicates something good has happened. Generally, the player
adds the 6 to the current total and rolls again, adding and rerolling as
long as a 6 comes up.

* **D (as in "1D"):** An abbreviation for "six-sided dice." The number
in front of the "D" is part of the die code, and lets you know how many
six-sided dice to roll.

* **damage resistance total:** A number that indicates how much injury
a character or object can absorb, soak, or deﬂect.

* **damage total:** A number representing how much injury or destruction 
something has caused. 

* **defaulting to an attribute:** Using the die code for an attribute when
the character doesn't have a higher die code in the needed skill.
die code, score:** The number of six-sided dice players roll (1D, 2D,
3D, 4D, 5D, etc.), and sometimes an amount (called pips) of "+1" or
"+2" that is added to the total result that came up on the dice. "Die
code" and "score" are used interchangeably.

* **difficulty:** A number representing how challenging it is to perform
an action.

* **Fate Point:** A bonus representing that a character is using all of
her concentration to try to succeed. Allows the player to, at least,
double the number of dice on one roll. Sometimes the gamemaster
will provide other beneﬁts.

* **free action:** Any action that needs only a few seconds to perform or
do, such as taking a few steps or glancing quickly around a room.

* **modiﬁer:** A number or die code that is added or subtracted
from another number or die code to represent a change in the
typical situation.

* **opposed difficulty, opposed roll:** A difficulty that applies when
one character resists another character's action. In this case, both
characters roll die codes related to the activity and compare them.

* **passive defense value:** A number representing a character's innate
ability to get out of the way of danger. It usually equals 10.

* **pip:** An added bonus to the total result that came up on the
dice. A "+1" means one is added to the total, while "+2" means
two is added.

* **range (in combat):** The distance from the attacker to the target.
result points:** The difference between the total rolled with an
attribute's or skill's die code and the difficulty of an action.

* **result point bonus:** Usually, one-half (rounded up) of the
result points ﬁgured for an action. It sometimes may be used to
affect other rolls.

* **round:** A unit of time equal to ﬁve seconds in the game world.
Figuring out what happens in a round can take longer.

* **scale:** A game mechanic representing that opponents of vastly
different sizes can affect each other differently in combat.

* **standard difficulty:** A number, generally selected from a chart,
assigned to an action based on how challenging it is.

* **Strength Damage:** A die code representing the amount of harm
a character can do because of his or her physical prowess.

* **Toughness:** A die code representing the amount of damage an
object can take, similar to a character's Physique attribute.

* **unskilled modiﬁer, untrained modiﬁer:** A modiﬁer added to
an action's difficulty that represents the increased difficulty of doing
something without the right training or experience. The terms are
used interchangeably.

* **Wild Die:** A six-sided die, of a different color or size from other
dice used, that represents the randomness of life, with the 1 and
the 6 indicating a special result (see Critical Failure and Critical
Success).

* **Wounds:** One of two ways of indicating the amount of injury
a character can sustain, listed as a level. The level is determined by
comparing the difference between the damage total and the damage
resistance total to a chart. May be used alone or with Body Points.


Character Basics
================

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

This chapter covers three methods of character creation and provides
an overview of the attributes and skills available to characters. If you've
made a character already, skip past "Character Creation" to "Attributes"
and skim the rest of the chapter, adjusting your character if necessary.


Character Creation
------------------

To make a character, you'll need to select a template from within
this book or another D6 game, or make your own. A blank character
sheet also is included at the end of this book. You can either photocopy
your chosen sheet, or copy the information onto a separate piece of
paper. You also can ﬁnd the templates available free at the West End
Games Web site, www.westendgames.com.


Templates
---------

A few starting templates have been provided at the end of this book.To
get started right away, pick one and distribute seven skill dice among the
skills listed; the dice for attributes have already been done for you. Note
that the listed skills are the ones that type of character might typically
have, though you could include others not on the list if you'd like.
For skill descriptions and details on how to distribute skill dice, see
the "Skills" section later in this chapter.

If desired, you can ﬁll in the other character features (such as gender,
age, and so on) and provide any additional notes on the character's
history. There is no need to purchase equipment, as that has already
been ﬁgured for the characters.

If you choose a template from another D6 game, you may need to
make some adjustments in the types of skills a character based on that
might have. Check the list herein to make sure the template's skills
are described in this D6 version. If one is not, either cross it off the
template or substitute a similar skill that does exist.
Once you have ﬁnished ﬁlling in your template, you can either start
playing the game with your group, or you can skip to the "Game Basics"
chapter and read more on how to use your new character.


Deﬁned Limits
-------------

If you wish to make your own starting character from scratch, without
a template but with deﬁned limits on what can be put into attributes and
skills, use these guidelines. This chapter describes each characteristic in
more detail, including examples on how you can split the dice.
These guidelines assume you'll make a normal Human character.
If not, talk with your gamemaster about the minimums, maximums,
and other requirements for the character species you want to use. See
the various sections in this chapter for details on dice distribution and
ﬁguring out other aspects of your character.

* Attributes: Distribute 18 dice among the seven attributes. The
minimum is 1D and the maximum is 5D in all attributes except Extranormal 
attributes, which remains at 0D for most characters.

* Skills: Distribute seven dice among the skills. The maximum number
of dice added to any one skill is 3D.

* Move: This equals 10 meters per round.

* Body Points: If your gamemaster is using this characteristic, roll
your character's Strength and add 20 to the total. Ignore this 
characteristic if your gamemaster is using Wounds only.

* Wounds: If your gamemaster relies on the Wound levels option
with Body Points, see the appropriate table in the "Damage" chapter to
determine the range of Body Points associated with each Wound level. If
your gamemaster uses Wounds only, you don't need to ﬁgure out the Body

* Points range; you can put a line through that column if you'd like.

* Strength Damage: Drop the pips from your character's Strength
or lift score (including any Special Abilities or Disadvantages that
affect the die code), divide the number by 2, and round up. This is the
Strength Damage die code.

* Funds and Credits: Funds and credits measure how much wealth
your character can usually get at without too much trouble. All 
characters start with a base Funds die code of 3D. Look under "Funds" in
this chapter for modiﬁers to this roll and how to convert this number
to cash. The cash equivalent of Funds goes on the Credits line.
Character Points: Characters start with ﬁve Character Points.

* Fate Points: Characters start with one Fate Point.

* For equipment, Advantages, Disadvantages, Special Abilities, 
background, and character features, see the appropriate sections in 
this chapter for more details on how to ﬁll out these optional sections.

### Gamemaster's Characters ###

Gamemaster's characters (sometimes referred to as nonplayer characters 
or NPCs) may or may not be created using the same rules as players' 
characters. Because the gamemaster's characters serve as interactive 
elements in the story, it all depends on the NPC's importance to the 
storyline. Minor gamemaster's characters have fewer attribute and skill 
dice, fewer Body Points or Wounds, and few (if any) character options,
Character Points, or Fate Points. Major characters, however, should 
follow the same guidelines as the players' characters, possibly having 
more skill dice, Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities than 
a typical starting player's character. An increase over the players' 
characters reﬂects the fact that a major antagonist has been around 
much longer.

Creation Point Pool
-------------------

Those who wish to use points to create their characters, rather than
following a template or being restricted in what they can put in skills and
attributes, can use a point system. Each novice character receives 79
creation points to distribute among all the options. Players may only
spend creation points as whole points, not fractions. See the "Attribute" and
"Skills" sections in this chapter for details on distributing dice.

* One attribute die equals fourcreation points.

* One skill die equals one creation point.

* Three skill specialization dice equal one creation point.

* Advantages and Special Abilities have their own costs associated with
them; see the "Character Options" chapter for details.

Other restrictions apply:

* Attributes have a minimum of 1D and a maximum of 5D, except
in Extranormal attributes (which may have a minimum of 0D).

* The maximum starting number of dice that may be added to any
one skill or specialization of skill is 3D.

Players of Human characters may add up to 10 additional creation
points to their totals by taking an appropriate number of ranks in 
Disadvantages. Non-Human species may have their own creation point
totals, maximum number of points from Disadvantages, and starting
Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities.

For worlds involving more Special Abilities, gamemasters should
feel free to raise the number of starting creation points and the number
of possible creation points received from Disadvantages.

Characters also receive the following aspects, like those created
with deﬁned limits:

* Move: This equals 10 meters per round.

* Body Points: If your gamemaster includes this characteristic, roll
your character's Strength and add 20 to the total. Ignore this 
characteristic if your gamemaster is using Wounds only.

* Wounds: If your gamemaster relies on the Wound levels option
with Body Points, see the appropriate table in the "Damage" chapter to
determine the range of Body Points associated with each Wound level.
If your gamemaster uses Wounds only, you don't need to ﬁgure out the
Body Points range; you can put a line through that column if you'd like.
Strength Damage: Drop the pips from your character's Strength or lift
score (including any Special Abilities or Disadvantages that affect the
die code), divide the number by 2, and round up. This is the Strength
Damage die code.

* Funds and Credits: Funds and credits measure how much wealth your 
character can usually get at without too much trouble. All characters 
start with a base Funds die code of 3D. Look under "Funds" in this
chapter for modiﬁers to this roll and how to convert this number to 
cash. The cash equivalent of Funds goes on the Credits line.


Attributes
----------

Each character has seven attributes, which measure basic physical and 
mental abilities that are common to every living creature (and some
nonliving things), no matter what universe or dimension they exist in.

Agility: A measure of how physically articulate your character is,
including his eye-hand coordination and agility.

Strength: Measure of your character's physical power and ability
to resist damage.

Mechanical: Your character's prowess at operating mechanical
equipment like vehicles, shields, spaceships, and sensors.

Knowledge: Measure of your character's overall intelligence.

Perception: Your character's awareness of himself and things around
him, including the ability to interact with others.

Technical: Your character's ability to manipulate, repair, and modify
technology.

Extranormal: Measure of a character's extraordinary abilities. In D6
Space, Metaphysics is the only Extranormal attribute, although 
gamemasters looking for more options (such as psionics or magic) may wish
to consult other D6 System books. It is often listed by its type, rather
than by the term "Extranormal." Most characters begin with a score of
0D, since people with such abilities are extremely rare. Those who have
an Extranormal attribute must decide how it's manifested. Characters
almost never have more than one Extranormal attribute.

When you put dice in an attribute, you can either put whole dice in
each attribute, or you can give each a mixture of whole dice and pips.
Each die equals three pips.

### Creating Experienced Characters ###

If you are making an experienced character, you'll need to ﬁgure out 
how many more years that character has been around than one starting out.


**By Deﬁned Limits**

Using the initial novice totals of seven skill dice, ﬁve Character 
Points, and one Fate Point, add 15 skill dice, 15 Character Points, 
and two Fate Points to the initial totals for each year the character 
has been a full-time active adventurer. (For part-timers, halve these 
fgures, rounding up.)


**By Creation Point Pool**

With the initial novice totals of 79 creation points, ﬁve
Character Points, and one Fate Point as a starting point,
add 15 creation points, 15 Character Points, and two Fate
Points for each year the character has been a full-time
active adventurer. (For part-timers, halve these ﬁgures,
rounding up.) Unless the gamemaster decides otherwise,
there are no maximums for skills and Disadvantages.


**Creating Existing Characters**

Players basing their characters on existing ﬁctional
entities should ignore the skill and Disadvantage limits
and, with their gamemaster's approval, create the character
by distributing dice as best reﬂects how the character
appears in his, her, or its stories.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Character Basics
----------------

Example: *You've distributed most of your attribute dice, but you have
four dice left to put in Perception and Technical. You could put 1D in 
Perception and 3D in Technical, or 1D+2 in Perception and 2D+1 in 
Technical, or some similar combination.*

Extranormal is the only attribute in which a Human character may have 
no dice; there is no maximum that a Human character may have in this 
attribute. No Human character may have less than 1D or more than 5D in 
any other attribute. Other species have other minimums and maximums, 
which are either listed with the species description or speciﬁed by 
the gamemaster.


Skills
------

Skills are more speciﬁc applications of an attribute. For example, the
skill dodge is a more speciﬁc use of your character's Agility. Characters
learn them through instruction or experience.

Skills are areas of expertise that are not necessarily common to
every living creature. Some creatures simply don't have the capacity
to learn certain skills.

All skills beneath a given attribute begin at that attribute's die code.
To highlight skills in which the character has trained or has some
experience, add pips or dice to the base attribute value.

As with attributes, when creating your character you can either put
whole dice in each skill, or you can give each a mixture of whole dice
and pips. Remember that each die equals three pips.

Example: *You've chosen your attribute scores, including putting 2D+1 in 
Technical. If you wanted her to be a little better in the
demolitions skill, you could add one pip to the base attribute to get a
demolitions skill score of 2D+2. If you decided to add two pips to the
base attribute, the demolitions score becomes 3D.*

You can also specialize in skills. Specializations reﬂect a greater
familiarity in a particular area covered by a base skill. One skill die
equals three specialization dice. Of course, one specialization die still
equals three pips.

You don't need to have any extra dice in the base skill in order to
take a specialization in that skill, but when you give your character
specializations in that manner, they are treated as separate skills. If
you give your character specializations in base skills he already has,
those specializations are considered bonuses to the base skill when
attempting tasks of that type.

Once you've chosen at least one specialization and put one or two
pips or dice in it, you have to use the remaining specialization dice
and pips to either purchase more pips in the same specialization or
purchase one or more pips in other specializations.

You roll the specialization's die code only when you use the speciﬁc
item or knowledge reﬂected by the specialization. Otherwise, you roll
the base skill (or attribute if you didn't put additional dice in the 
full skill).

Example: *If your character's Technical is 2D+2 and her demolitions is 3D,
you could give her a demolitions specialization of vehicles of +1 (which 
means that, when she's attempting to blow up planetary vehicles, she 
rolls three dice and adds 1 to the total). You would then have two 
specialization dice and two specialization pips to place among
other specializations. With these, you could further improve her 
demolitions: vehicles specialization, or you could pick one or more 
other specializations in the same or other base skills.

You decide that with one other specialization pip, you'll give your character
vehicle repair: ground vehicles, but you won't take the full vehicle repair
skill for her. This allows your character to have vehicle repair: ground
vehicles at 3D (add 1 to the die code of the base attribute, Technical,
which is 2D+2). Thus, when your character attempts to ﬁx a hovercraft,
you roll 3D, but if she tries to make adjustments to a boat, you only
rely on the attribute's score, which is 2D+2.*

A character may not have dice in any skill associated with an 
Extranormal attribute unless he already has dice in that attribute.

The maximum number of dice the character may start with in any
base skill is 3D greater than the governing attribute, with no more than
3D greater than the base skill in any specialization.

You can ﬁnd the list of skills, with deﬁnitions, on the next two
pages.

Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities
------------------------------------------------

Advantages and Disadvantages are beneﬁts or quirks your character
has developed. Some affect the character's attributes and skills, while
others serve as useful roleplaying tools for rounding out the character.
Special Abilities are unusual talents or powers the character has that
most other Humans don't have. The next chapter,"Character Options,"
discusses these characteristics. You may ignore this section if you 
don't want to add them to your character.

### Focused Skills ###

Some gamemasters prefer narrower skill categories, 
requiring characters to select more speciﬁc abilities, such as
vehicle operation: ground or languages: Old Terran. If that's the
case, players' characters start with 21 skill dice or 93 creation
points. Players will need to get gamemaster approval on any
subcategories they choose, while gamemasters need to insure
that the subcategories are neither too broad (all scientiﬁc
disciplines) or too narrow (a particular model of handgun).
Players may take specializations of these narrower skills, as
described in the rules.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Skills
------

As this skill list includes broad deﬁnitions not applicable in all eras 
or worlds for which D6 Space could be used, the gamemaster has
the ﬁnal say on actual skill applications. For difficulties associated 
with each skill, see the "Example Skill Difficulties" chapter.


### Agility*###

* acrobatics: Performing feats of gymnastics, extraordinary balance, and 
dance (and related performance arts), as well as breaking falls and 
escaping from bonds.

* brawling: Competence in unarmed combat.

* dodge: Slipping out of danger's way, whether avoiding an attack
or a sprung booby trap.

* ﬁrearms: Shooting any gun a person can carry, even if it requires
a tripod setup to ﬁre. Covers everything from small slug throwers
to shoulder-launched rockets.

* ﬂying/0-G: Maneuvering under on one's own power (such
as with wings) or in zero-gravity environments (such as drifting
through space in an environmental suit).

* melee combat: Wielding hand-to-hand weapons.
missile weapons: Firing unpowered ranged weapons.

* riding: Controlling and riding domesticated mounts.

* running: Moving quickly while avoiding obstacles and keeping
from stumbling.

* sleight of hand: Nimbleness with the ﬁngers, including picking
pockets, palming items, and opening mechanical locks.

* throwing: Hitting a target accurately with a thrown item,
including grenades, stones, and knives. Also used for catching
thrown items. (Using or modifying grenades as explosives for
special destructive effects requires the demolitions skill.)


### Strength ###

* climb/jump: Climbing or jumping over obstacles.

* lift: Moving or lifting heavy objects, as well as the ability to
inﬂict additional damage with strength-powered weapons.

* stamina: Physical endurance and resistance to pain, disease,
and poison.

* swim: Moving and surviving in a liquid medium

### Mechanical ###

* comm: Effectively using communication devices and arrays.

* exoskeleton operation: Using single-person conveyances with
skills and abilities that substitute for (not augment) the character's
own skills and abilities. This skill substitutes for the character's
Agility and Strength skills when using the "suit."

* gunnery: Accurately ﬁring weapons mounted on powered
armor, vehicles, and spaceships, or within fortresses.

* navigation: Plotting courses, such as through space using a
vessel's navigational computer interface, or on land using maps
or landmarks, as well as creating maps.

* piloting: Flying air- or space-borne craft, from hovercraft and
in-atmosphere ﬁghters to transports and battleships.

* sensors: Operating scanner arrays to gather information about
one's surroundings.

* shields: Deploying and redirecting shields aboard vehicles.

* vehicle operation: Operating non-ﬂying vehicles traveling on
or through the ground or a liquid medium.


### Knowledge ###

* aliens: Understanding of aliens not of the character's own
species and their physiology, customs, and history.

* astrography: Familiarity with astrographic features (planets,
star systems, nebulae), and general knowledge of any civilized
elements present (settlements, industry, government, orbital
installations).

* bureaucracy: Knowledge of and ability to use a bureaucracy's
intricate procedures to gain information, and favors, or attain
other goals.

* business: Comprehension of business practices and the monetary value 
of goods and opportunities, including the ability to
determine how to make money with another skill the character
has. Business can complement bargain when haggling over prices
for goods and services being bought or sold.

* cultures: Understanding of the manners, customs, and social
expectations of different cultures, including one's own.
intimidation: Using physical presence, verbal threats, taunts,
or fear to inﬂuence others or get information out of them.

* languages: Familiarity with and ability to use various forms of
communication, including written, spoken, and nonverbal. Characters 
may choose one"native" language in which they have written
and spoken ﬂuency. Additional languages in which a character has
proﬁciency can be represented by specializations of this skill.

* scholar: This skill represents knowledge and/or education
in areas not covered under any other skill (such as chemistry,
mathematics, archeology, cooking, art, etc.). This may be restricted
to a speciﬁc ﬁeld (represented by specializations) or a general
knowledge of a wide range of subjects. It is used to remember
details, rumors, tales, legends, theories, important people, and
the like, as appropriate for the subject in question. However, the
broader the category, the fewer the details that can be recalled.
It covers what the character himself can recall. Having another
skill as a specialization of the scholar skill means that the character
knows the theories and history behind the skill but can't actually
use it. Scholar can be useful with investigation to narrow a search
for information.

* security regulations: Understanding of how law enforcement
organizations, regulations, and personnel operate.

* streetwise: Finding information, goods, and contacts in an urban
environment, particularly through criminal organizations, black
markets, and other illicit operations. Also useful for determining
possible motives and methods of criminals.

* survival: Knowledge of techniques for surviving in hostile, wilderness 
environments, as well as the ability to handle animals.

* tactics: Familiarity with deploying military forces and maneuvering 
them to the best advantage.

* willpower: Ability to withstand stress, temptation, other people's
interaction attempts, mental attacks, and pain. The gamemaster
may allow a specialization in a speciﬁc faith tradition or belief system
to enhance many, though not all, applications of willpower.


### Perception ###

* artist: Making works of art, like paintings, photographs, and
music or literary compositions.

* bargain: Haggling over prices for goods and services being
bought or sold, as well as using bribery.

* command: Effectively ordering and coordinating others in team
situations (such as commanding a battleship crew).

* con: Bluffing, lying, tricking, or deceiving others, as well as
verbal evasiveness, misdirection, blustering, and altering features
or clothing to be unrecognizable or to look like someone else. Also
useful in putting on acting performances.

* forgery: Creating and noticing false or altered documentation
in various media (paper, electronic, plastic card, etc.), including
counterfeiting, though tasks may require other skills to help detect
or make the forgery.

* gambling: Winning and cheating at games of strategy and
luck.

* hide: Concealing objects, both on oneself and using camouﬂage.
investigation: Gathering information, researching topics,
analyzing data, and piecing together clues.

* know-how: Figuring out how to perform an action in which
the character does not have experience, as well as a catch-all skill
encompassing areas not covered by other skills (such as utilitarian
sewing or cooking).

* persuasion: Inﬂuencing others or getting information out
of them through bribery, honest discussion, debate, diplomacy,
speeches, friendliness, ﬂattery, or seduction. Also useful in 
negotiations, business transactions, and putting on performances 
(such as singing, acting, or storytelling).

* search: Spotting hidden objects or people, reconnoitering,
lipreading, eavesdropping on or watching other people, or tracking
the trails they've left behind.

* sneak: Moving silently, avoiding detection and hiding oneself.


### Technical ###

* armor repair: Fixing damaged armor.

* computer interface/repair: Programming, interfacing with,
and ﬁxing computer systems.

* demolitions: Setting explosives to achieve particular destructive effects.

powered armor, environmental suits, and similar suits.

* ﬁrearms repair: Repairing and modifying any gun a person can
carry, from small slug throwers to shoulder-launched rockets..

* ﬂight systems repair: Fixing damaged systems aboard ﬂying
vehicles and spaceships.

* gunnery repair: Fixing weapons mounted on powered armor,
vehicles, or spaceships, or within fortresses.

* medicine: Using basic ﬁeld medicine to treat injuries, as well
as detailed understanding and applying medical procedures,
such as diagnosing illnesses, performing surgery, and implanting
cybernetics.

* personal equipment repair: Fixing small electronic equipment,
including damaged cybernetics.

* robot interface/repair: Programming, interfacing with and
ﬁxing robots and their systems.

* security: Installing, altering, and bypassing electronic security
and surveillance systems.

* vehicle repair: Fixing ground- and ocean-based vehicles that
do not ﬂy.


### Extranormal: Metaphysics ###

Metaphysics is one possible Extranormal attribute. For speciﬁc
information, see its chapter in this book.

* channel: Focusing energy within herself and her surroundings
to harm others or protect herself and others from harm.

* sense: Detecting anything in existence, learn about her s
urroundings, and touch and inﬂuence minds.

* transform: Altering people and things within the universe,
including moving something from one location to another and
changing a target's natural capabilities temporarily.


Move
----

This number (usually 10) represents how many meters your character moves 
in a round at maximum walking speed in standard (1 g) gravity. (The 
running skill can increase this rate. It also serves as the base for 
other movement skills.)

Should the character have a different sort of movement than normal
(such as ﬁns for legs), see the Hindrance Disadvantage (described in
the "Character Options" chapter) for information on how to account
for this variability.

Special Points
--------------

Players' characters typically start the game with one Fate Point and
ﬁve Character Points. You can spend these points to improve your
character's chance of succeeding in especially difficult situations. (The
mechanics of this are discussed in the "Game Basics" chapter.)
Character Points alternatively are used to permanently improve
skills. Your character earns more Character and Fate Points by
having adventures. There is no limit to the number of Character
or Fate Points your character may have at any time.


Body Points and Wounds
----------------------

This section of the character sheet allows you to keep
track of the healthiness of your character. Which you use
depends on the gamemaster.


Determining Body Points
-----------------------

When you create a new character, roll her Strength (including any
modiﬁers from Disadvantages or Special Abilities) and add 20. (Treat a
1 that comes up on the Wild Die as a 1 and add it to the total as normal;
it has no negative effect on the result.) This becomes her Body Point
total. Write it on the character sheet in the space provided. Templates
already have their Body Points determined.

Example: *Your character has 3D+1 in Physique. You roll three dice,
making sure one of them is the Wild Die. The dice come up 4 and 6,
with a 1 on the Wild Die. Since the 1 has no negative effect, you add the
numbers to arrive at a total of 11.You then include the pip bonus of 1 with
this for 12. Finally, you add 12 to 20 to get a Body Point total of 32.*


Determining Wounds
------------------

If your gamemaster is using the Wound levels option with Body
Points, see the appropriate table in the "Damage" chapter to determine
the range of Body Points associated with each Wound level. If your
gamemaster is only using Wounds, you don't need to ﬁgure out the Body
Points range; you can put a line through that column if you'd like.


Strength Damage
---------------

Strength Damage indicates the amount of harm a character can
do in combat with body parts, melee weapons, thrown weapons, and
most missile weapons.


Determining Strength Damage
---------------------------

To determine the Strength Damage die code, take the character's
Strength or lift (including any die code modiﬁers from Disadvantages
or Special Abilities) and drop the pips. Divide by 2, and round up.

Example: *A character with 3D in Strength has a Strength Damage
of 2D. A character with 6D+2 in lift has a Strength Damage of 3D.*


Templates and Strength Damage
-----------------------------

If you added dice to a template's lift skill, you'll need to adjust the
Strength Damage value listed. Use the information above to correct
the number.


Funds
-----

To allow the gamemaster to more easily adjust the "real world" cost
to something appropriate for her world or her part of the world, this
system substitutes difficulties for the prices of items. Each character
thus gets a Funds attribute, which represents the amount of money the 
character can get without too much trouble on a regular basis because 
of work or investments.

All characters start with a base of 3 in Funds. Use the
accompanying table to adjust this number.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

### Determining Funds ###

*Characteristic: Modiﬁer*

* 1D in Perception: -1
* 1D in Knowledge: -1
* 4D or more in Perception: +1
* 4D or more in Knowledge: +1
* 8D or more in business skill plus its specializations: +1

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Include any modiﬁers to attributes due to Disadvantages or Special 
Abilities. The minimum total is 1. The ﬁnal total becomes the die code
in the Funds attribute.

After character creation, a player can increase the Funds attribute by
spending Character Points (using the rules in the "Improving Characit has 
ters" chapter) or through bonuses received as adventure rewards.
If the gamemaster prefers to use cash or its equivalent, multiply the
Funds total by a value speciﬁed by the gamemaster (typically about 175
credits, but gamemasters may increase or decrease this depending on
how expensive goods and services are in their universe). This is how
much money the character receives per week for whatever sort of work
the character does or investments the character has.

Example: *Your character has 4D in Knowledge, 6D in business,
and +2D in a specialization of business, investing. Starting with 3, you
add to it 1 for your high Knowledge score and 1 for having at least 8D
in business plus a specialization. Your ﬁnal total is 4, which gives you
a Funds score of 5D. If your gamemaster preferred cash, you would
start with a regular income of 875 credits per week.

Using the Funds attribute is discussed in the "Equipment" chapter.


Equipment
---------

Players of starting characters may select one small weapon and a
little protective gear plus a few tools of their characters' chosen trade,
unless there is equipment already listed on the template sheet. Some
basic equipment is explained in the "Equipment" chapter; the gamemaster 
may allow other options.


Character Features and Other Details
------------------------------------

The character sheet provided in this book and most other templates
include spots for your character's name, career, species, gender, age, height,
weight, and other information. Unless speciﬁed by the template or your
gamemaster allows it, your character's species is Human. Everything else
in these sections you are free to ﬁll in as you like.


Height and Weight
-----------------

Players who want their characters signiﬁcantly larger or smaller than
the average Human have a few options. If the size is proportionately
larger or smaller, then the character must have the Size Advantage. If
the size is a hindrance, then the character should have the Hindrance
Disadvantage as well.


Character Options
=================

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

This chapter is for players who want to explore more of their 
characters' possible backgrounds and abilities. After completing 
basic character generation in Chapter 1, look through this chapter 
to "ﬂesh out" your character's history and abilities. You'll ﬁnd 
interesting game and storyrelated options called Advantages, 
Disadvantages, and Special Abilities. These suggest the fact that your 
character might have knowledge, resources, or abilities that aren't 
reﬂected by the character's attributes and skills. If something 
inspires you to change your character's basic characteristics, feel 
free to go back and make adjustments.


Expanding the Character Concept
-------------------------------

When you ﬁrst created your character, you probably had a character
concept in mind or one was suggested by the template that you used.
Now's the time to expand the character's history.
There are several ways you can do this. The easiest is to answer
questions like:

* Where and when was my character born?
* What did my character do as a child?
* What unusual experiences did my character have?
* How did my character become the character he is now?
* What is one of my character's major goals?
* What was my character doing right before the game begins?
* Why does your character have the skills that he has?

Say your character knows ﬁrearms and several specializations.
Why? Was the character in the army? A mercenary? A member of a
megacorporation security force? How were these skills learned? You
don't have to explain every skill, but try to rationalize any unusual skills
(such as Metaphysics skills), as well as skills the character has two dice
or more in (he is really good at those).

There are, of course, other questions you can come up with, though
these are among the most common.

You can jot down notes and go back and ﬁll in the gaps as you play.
You can make up the name of the character's school, the exact date
of birth, and other things as you go along. If you're stuck for ideas,
read the basic description of the game setting or remember pertinent
books, television shows, and movies -- you can develop ideas based
on them.


Peruse the Character Options
----------------------------

You might not want to write a background for your character until
you look at some of the options available to you. Take a look at the
Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities, and see some of the
beneﬁts and drawbacks you can choose for your character. You might
see something you want to work in, and that will help give you ideas
for a background story.


Aliens and Mutants
------------------

Gamemasters and players can use character options to tweak the
starting character Human base into any sort of species concept that
they desire. The next chapter,"Aliens and Human Offshoots," provides
some generic non-Human write-ups and character packages based on
them, in addition to questions to help in making new ones.

When creating a species template, every character based on that
species must have certain background Special Abilities, Disadvantages,
and possibly Advantages. However, enough points should remain with
which the player may customize the character. Usually, the character ends
up with more options than normal for the average person in the game
setting, but fewer than if the player had stuck with Human. (Experienced
members of the species should have more skills and, perhaps, higher
levels of the template's Special Abilities and Disadvantages.)


Selecting Character Options
---------------------------

Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities make the character
more interesting, more (and less) effective, and more fun to roleplay (if
you do it right). You know the story of your character -- here's what
that story means.

Advantages are perks that the character has because of her status
in society, the people she knows, or something in her background. They
generally do not directly affect attributes or skills.

Disadvantages hamper the character in some way. They might affect
her attributes or skills or they might mean trouble for her in certain
situations. Both Advantages and Disadvantages make the character
more rounded and more believable.

Special Abilities are those talents or gifts that exceed the usual
natural capabilities of a Human character. The character's species, some
sort of unique training, or a magical/super-science/cybernetic/other
effect might explain their origin. They give the character a bonus to
her attributes or skills, or they provide her with access to something
that the average Human character can't do.

### Game Mechanics ###

Within the descriptions of several Advantages, Disadvantages, and 
Special Abilities, you'll notice references to game
mechanics that haven't been explained yet (like the Critical
Failure die result and the names of difficulty levels). If this
is your ﬁrst time playing a D6 game, you can ignore these for
now. You'll learn more about them in the next chapter. Once
you start playing adventures, you'll ﬁnd the game mechanics
in this chapter useful.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Example: *You decide to give your character a Special Ability that
provides him with a +1 to one of three combat-related skill totals. If
you don't have any points to spend on Special Abilities, your character
needs to have some kind of Disadvantage as well. The character might
have to add 1 to the difficulty of all interaction-related skill totals, or
you might include a totally unrelated Disadvantage (of comparative
power) -- like the character is afraid of the dark and has trouble 
acting when in the dark.*


Using Character Options
-----------------------

Every character option has its own rules for implementation.
There are, if you look hard enough, some nightmarish combinations.
If something seems like it is could cause trouble in the game later on,
check with your gamemaster before choosing it. Ultimately, the gamemaster 
has ﬁnal say on the choice of all Advantages, Disadvantages,
and Special Abilities, as well as ﬁnal say on the interpretation of those
choices. Players who misuse their character options, particularly their
Disadvantages, may ﬁnd their Advantages or Special Abilities meeting
with some unfortunate accident.


Organization
------------

Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities are listed 
alphabetically in their respective sections. Advantages and Disadvantages
are further organized into ranks. These ranks are numbered; higher 
numbered ranks are more powerful. They are abbreviated R1, R2, R3,
R4, and so on. Special Abilities don't have listed ranks. Instead, the
descriptions give the initial cost for gaining one rank in that ability.

Note: Gamemasters may allow higher ranks of character options
than the examples given here. Players and gamemasters should discuss
the best way to represent their characters' unique set of traits.


Costs at Character Creation
---------------------------

Each rank in an Advantage or Disadvantage is worth one creation
point (or one skill die, if you're using deﬁned limits) per number.
Advantages cost creation points, while Disadvantages give you creation
points (or skill dice). Thus, a Rank 1 Advantage costs one point or die,
while a Rank 4 Disadvantage gives you four points or dice.

The cost of one rank of the Special Ability is included in parentheses. 
Some Special Abilities, such as Longevity, do not lend themselves
to being taken more than once. Players may also add Limitations to
their Special Abilities, which reduce their effectiveness (and the cost)
or Enhancements, which increase their effectiveness (and the cost);
these are described at the end of this section.

In settings where characters with Special Abilities are common,
additional ranks of each Special Ability cost one point (or skill die) per
rank at character creation. In settings where characters with Special
Abilities are uncommon, additional ranks of each Special Ability cost
the value listed with the Special Ability.

When using templates or deﬁned limits for attributes and skill dice,
players may use skill dice or dice received from Disadvantages to get
Advantages and Special Abilities. Players in games using character creation
point pools may use some of the points in their pool or points gained
from Disadvantages to purchase Advantages and Special Abilities.

A maximum of 10 creation points' (or 10 extra skill dice) worth of
Disadvantages is recommended for any genre.

Special Abilities are uncommon. Enhancements add to the total cost of 
the Special Ability. Limitations subtract from the total of the base 
cost of the Special Ability plus the cost of its ranks plus the cost of 
its Enhancements. The minimum cost for a Special Ability plus 
Enhancements and Limitations is 1.


Using the Creation Points
-------------------------

You may use creation points that you earn from giving your character
Disadvantages to buy Advantages (at their rank cost), more skill dice
(at a rate of one creation point for each skill die), or more attribute dice
(at a rate of four creation points for each attribute die).


Disadvantages
=============

Many Disadvantages exist as counterparts to the Advantages or
Special Abilities listed herein. A Skill Bonus Special Ability is the
positive side of a Hindrance Disadvantage. Some have roleplaying
effects, while others alter attributes and skills.
When choosing Disadvantages, keep a few things in mind:

1. You're going to have to live with the Disadvantage. Take only
Disadvantages that you don't expect to ever get rid of -- there are rules
for eliminating Disadvantages, but the gamemaster may allow their
use only after lots of adventuring.

2. Choose more roleplaying Disadvantages than game mechanic
ones. Instead of sticking to easy-to-use modiﬁers to skill attempts
or abilities, select a few Disadvantages that you can roleplay. 
Disadvantages that can be roleplayed and can work themselves into an
adventure story are much more interesting than simple modiﬁers to
difficulty numbers.

3. The Disadvantage has to be a disadvantage. Any Disadvantage
that can be easily worked around, no matter how potent, or that actually 
helps the character on a regular basis is not a Disadvantage. For
example, if a character has an Advantage Flaw where he can't use his
Advantage when the temperature is above 100, and the character is
always adventuring in places where the temperature is generally lower,
then it is not a Disadvantage. Check all Disadvantages (and other
character options, for that matter) with your gamemaster and explain
to him what you think they mean before you start playing the game.
That way, you can avoid this problem before it crops up. Gamemasters
who ﬁgure out the player was purposely trying to break the system
may take away the Disadvantage and an equal amount of Advantages,
Special Abilities, and maybe even Character and Fate Points.


### Achilles' Heel (R3) ###

The character has a particular serious weakness. It is not something
that most other characters ﬁnd especially dangerous or inconvenient,
but the character suffers severe modiﬁers to difficulties or even damage
when exposed to it. Some examples include:

* Allergy: A reasonably common things that she cannot always
avoid strongly affects the character. When exposed to the allergen, the
character must generate a Moderate Strength or stamina total (as an
action) or she takes 3D in damage. The character can resist the damage
through applicable defenses, but she has to generate the stamina total
as an action every round she is exposed to the allergen.

* Cultural Allergy: The same as above, but there is some social situation
that causes the character to freeze (exposure to nudity, the sight of police,
etc.) and lose all Critical Success rerolls until the condition is gone.

* Environmental Incompatibility: The character is sensitive to
something in the environment: an extreme of temperature, the chemical
content of rain water, a component of the atmosphere, or something
similar. Exposure to this without the proper protection causes the
character to take a -4 modiﬁer to his damage resistance total or a +1
modiﬁer to all difficulties (which increases by +1 per minute exposed)
until the character is out of the harmful situation.
    
    * Example: *The high quantity of carbon monoxide produced by
    some combustion engines may poison a plant creature. When in the
    presence of these engines (for instance, when in a big city where these
    sorts of engines are used), the character must have an air ﬁlter on at
    all times.*

* Metabolic Difference: The character needs more life support
(typically food) than "normal" and begins to take damage after hours
of malnutrition. For food, the character eats the equivalent of twice as
many meals per day as the average Human. For instance, the character
must eat a meal every four hours or, every hour after the four are up,
the character lose six Body Points or one Wound level, which cannot
be recovered except by eating. As another example, three times per
day, a different character may need to eat twice as much as a normal
Human.

* Nutritional Requirements: The character must ingest an element
not commonly consumed by Humans (blood, dead Human ﬂesh, etc.)
to survive. Often, the character encounters prejudice because of this,
and she certainly develops physical problems if she fails to consume
this substance in a reasonable amount of time.

* Rot: The character's body is rotting. She periodically loses pieces of
herself (such as ﬁngers and toes) and must pause to fuse them back on
(this is a simple action but takes a round to perform). The character 
suffers no damage from this, but it should inconvenience her. For instance,
in combat, the character's ﬁngers might fall off, causing her to drop her
weapon -- this makes an excellent Critical Failure complication.

* Vulnerability: A particular form of attack or interaction affects
the character much more severely than other characters. For example,
a character with a vulnerability to ﬁrearms might "freeze up" when he
sees another character point a gun at him -- making the other character 
+5 to hit him (most likely during the ﬁrst round of combat only).
Another character might automatically apply +10 to the difficulty of
any attempts to resist another character's con attempts. (The less likely
the situation is to occur, the greater the difficulty modiﬁer.)

Restrictions/Notes: The Achilles' Heel should be very serious, but
not "instant death" for the character. There should always exist some way
to avoid it (not easily), or some chance that the character can counter
it. The more likely it affects the character, the less it actually should do.
It's equally possible that the Achilles' Heel imposes different modiﬁers
under different circumstances.

Example: *A character who has allergy to small airborne particles
might and suffer +3 to the difficulty of all actions when in a dusty room
or riding in a vehicle on a dirt track but +5 when in a desert. Or, the
character might suffer 3D in damage every time he's in a dusty place.*


### Achilles' Heel (R4) ###

The character's weakness is even more severe than the Rank 3 version of 
this Disadvantage. Some examples include:

* Allergy: The same rules apply as for Allergy, save that the character
cannot perform any actions except running away while exposed to
the allergen.

* Cultural Allergy: The same rules apply as for Cultural Allergy
(R3), save that not only does the character lose all Critical Success
rerolls if exposed to the speciﬁed social situations, she also is at +1
to all difficulties.

* Environmental Incompatibility: The modiﬁer to the damage
resistance total goes up, or the condition is more likely to occur, or the
modiﬁer increases each round.

* Rot: The character loses major parts of his body periodically due
to rotting (such as limbs) and must pause to replace them. Doing so
requires no skill total but does take three rounds to perform. The 
trigger that causes this to take effect should occur no less frequently 
than a Critical Failure during combat and interaction rounds.

* Symbiosis: The character is bound symbiotically to another, drawing 
strength or energy from her. Symbiosis can be either physical or
mental. For every 100 meters by which one character is separated
from the other, the character loses one pip (cumulative) to either their
physical attributes (Agility, Mechanical, and Strength) or their mental
attributes (Knowledge, Perception, or Technical). (Remember: three
pips equal one die.) If the character's symbiote is killed, the character
loses 1D from the attributes affected until she can convince another
character to willingly bond with her (the bonding process should be
simple -- like sharing blood -- but willing participants must want it to
happen). For an extra rank in this Disadvantage, the character is bound
both mentally and physically to another, and loses from both sets of
attributes if separated. For the separation to equally affect the "host,"
he must also have this version of the Achilles' Heel Disadvantage.

Restrictions/Notes: Additional ranks of the Achilles' Heel Disadvantage 
indicate even more deadly situations. See Achilles' Heel (R3) for 
other notes.


### Advantage Flaw (R1) ###

This Disadvantage is linked to a particular Advantage or set of
skills. Whenever the character uses it, there is some a chance for a
negative modiﬁer or roleplaying disadvantage. Here are some examples
for certain Advantages:

* Contacts: The Contact helps the character, but he is either "annoying" 
about it or a "hard bargainer." Where a normal Contact would
assist the character for an almost negligible fee, the Flawed Contact
will haggle and nag until "rewarded." Some reason should exist why
the character would want to keep the contact happy.

* Cultures: When the character gets hints or knowledge about a
culture, he knows everything except some sort of critical piece of
information. Or, if the character has the "sweeping knowledge" of lots
of cultures, his interpretations sometimes are almost totally wrong
(gamemaster option). In order to make this Flaw work, the character
should not ﬁnd out about the error until it would be "interesting."

* Equipment: In most cases, some sort of minor mechanical imperfection 
exists in the equipment that no normal means can ﬁx. For
equipment that requires a skill total, gamemasters could either add
3 to the difficulty of all actions using it, or, on a Critical Failure, the
equipment won't work or malfunctions. For equipment that wouldn't
normally require a skill total, occasional side effects could happen or
maybe it requires a periodic Moderate skill check of some kind to
keep operating.

* Skills: If the character fails at the skill check with one of a set of
three related skills, she can't reroll Critical Successes either until the
end of the scene or until she succeeds at the skill check.

* Wealth or Funds: The character cannot access his wealth easily.
Either it is tied up in red tape most of the time (especially if the character
has most of the money invested), or he has to go somewhere to get it
(such as having a fortune back on a distant planet), or someone else
(reasonably friendly) has control over it
and doesn't always release it easily.

Restrictions/Notes: In general, at Rank 1, a ﬂaw should not debilitate a
character or take away his Advantage on a regular basis -- but it should 
make it a little less of a sure thing.


### Advantage Flaw (R2) ###

This Disadvantage works in exactly the same manner as Advantage Flaw
(R1), above, but with more serious results. If the Flaw came into play 
occasionally (like every time the character visited a desert), it now 
comes into play much more frequently (like when he is in any dry 
environment). If the Flaw made things a little more difficult, then
the Flaw makes things a lot more difficult (the difficulty modiﬁer doubles 
from the Rank 1 version).

Restrictions/Notes: Having circumstances that effectively take away
the complete beneﬁt of the Advantage is certainly within the bounds of 
Advantage Flaw (R2), and those circumstances can occur reasonably often 
(no more than during one quarter of a normal adventure, however). They 
will force the player to roleplay and to think about ways to get around 
the Flaw or to try other options, rather than just relying on a 
particular Advantage, Special Ability, or skill set.

Example: *If a character has a set of skills with the Flaw that they only
work at night -- a Rank 2 Flaw if only about a quarter of the character's
normal adventuring occurs during the daytime -- that would force the
character to rely on other abilities and his wits during the daytime.
The rules for Advantage Flaw (R2) are otherwise the same as
Rank 1.*


### Advantage Flaw (R3) ###

This rank takes on some of the characteristics of an Achilles' Heel
(R3), but more in direct relationship to an Advantage, an attribute,
or a large set of skills. The rules for the ﬂaw are the same as for
Advantage Flaw (R2), but the effects are even more severe. Not only
does the character lose the beneﬁts of the Advantage or attribute (or
undergoes a condition that essentially negates it), but he also suffers
an additional Disadvantage.

Example: *Your character has this Disadvantage attached to her
Metaphysics attribute. Every time she uses her special mental abilities,
she taps into the general mood of the people around her. If the people
near the metaphysicist experience strong or negative emotions, the
character gets a nasty headache, causing her to immediately lose the
ability to use her mental powers and her player to be unable to reroll
any Critical Successes until the end of the scene.
Example: *A character has Equipment (R3) -- a really powerful weapon. 
But, whenever the character suffers a Critical Failure using the weapon, 
it not only runs out of ammo, but the character experiences some sort
of feedback at a moderate damage total (maybe the weapon's normal
damage minus a speciﬁc amount). The character then has to recharge
the weapon (either through the use of a Price Disadvantage or by
waiting until a major break in the adventure's action, most likely).*

Some other examples:

* Infection: Under certain circumstances, the character passes
along select abilities and characteristics to another character. The
character has an infection score of Strength +2D. (This is not a skill
and players may not raise it except by taking additional ranks in this
version of the Disadvantage.)    

    * The gamemaster and the player should determine how the character
    spreads the infection. It could happen as the side effect of an attack,
    through physical contact, or through some other means. When the
    character performs the requisite action, he generates an infection total
    (which does not count as a separate action). The target generates a
    Strength or stamina total as well (which does not count as an action). If
    the character's infection total exceeds (not equal to) the target's Strength
    or stamina total, the target is infected.    

    * An infection passes certain Special Abilities and Disadvantages to the
    target (speciﬁed by the player and the gamemaster when the player gives
    the character this Disadvantage). It is possible for the infection to pass
    more ranks in Disadvantages on than Special Abilities, but is not possible
    for it to pass more ranks in Special Abilities than Disadvantages.
    Keep in mind that the infected character may well hate the character 
    responsible for his new state, so the infecting character may
    have gained an Enemy. In fact, there should exist some overwhelming
    reasons why this is actually bad for the infecting character -- it is a
    Disadvantage, after all.    

    * Gamemasters who do not feel that the Enemy Disadvantage is
    enough of a negative could also work in other sorts of Advantage Flaws
    as side effects of spreading the infection.
    For an extra rank in the Advantage Flaw: Infection Disadvantage,
    the infection die code increases to Strength+4D. Also, the penalties
    for infecting another characters should be more severe -- maybe the
    character infected then knows things about the infecting character that
    will give him an advantage over his enemy, or perhaps the infecting
    character temporarily loses abilities or attribute pips.

* Minor Stigma: There is something that the character cannot do
without performing the "proper rituals" before or after (a ﬁghter whose
cult must "purify" him after killing someone; a mentalist who cannot
use Metaphysics without special equipment).

* Stench: The character smells terrible due to one of his Advantages
or just because he exists. Add 6 to the difficulty of all sneak attempts, as
everyone can smell him coming. This also affects interaction attempts,
giving them at least a +1 to the difficulty.

Restrictions/Notes: Advantage Flaw (R3) takes a powerful
Advantage and turns it into a worse-than-useless Disadvantage for a
comparatively brief period of time. A single Advantage can have more
than one Advantage Flaw, and, if the character wants, several Flaws of
various ranks can link to one Advantage. See other ranks of Advantage
Flaw for more information and examples.


### Age (R1) ###

The character is a teenager or just past middle age. And, since this
is a roleplaying game and not real life, he'll stay that way. In general,
characters who are "too young" often have to roleplay through episodes
where they are not taken seriously, where they are ignored, and where
they have less rights and control than older characters. Those who
are "too old" get treated in much the same way -- characters in their
prime often defer to the character, but they also treat the character as
if he were inﬁrm or possibly senile.

Restrictions/Notes: In general, the gamemaster should try to treat
the character as if he were "too old" or "too young" and have fun with
it. Game mechanics are seldom required, as good roleplaying can make
things work here, but if they become necessary, add 3 to the difficulty of
intimidation and persuasion actions performed by the character that his
age would bother (a young character trying to lead a group of experienced
characters, or an older character trying to convince younger characters
that he is "with it"). A character may only have one version of Age.


### Age (R2) ###

The Disadvantage is the same, only more so. Instead of being a
teenager, the character is a preteen child. Instead of being just past
middle age, the character is old. The roleplaying situations are basically
the same, but the effects are more dramatic.

Restrictions/Notes: An old character receives +1 to the difficulty of
physical actions -- those that rely on Agility, Mechanical, and Strength
-- that require unusual exertion (running, jumping, ﬁghting, etc.). A
young character adds 1 to the difficulty of all mental actions -- those
that use Knowledge, Perception, or Technical -- when attempting to
solve "adult" problems or interact with adults. Players should roleplay
both versions true to type. Two Disadvantages suitable for association
with this one include Reduced Attribute (especially for Age: Old) and
Hindrance.

Characters may be "young" or "old" and not take this Disadvantage.
Older characters in good shape have no problems jogging, lifting, ﬁghting,
or whatever, and young, intelligent people can often interact and think
just as well -- if not better -- than adults. This Disadvantage addresses
those characters, young and old, who can't keep up as easily.


### Bad Luck (R2) ###

The character is exceptionally unlucky. This Disadvantage is under
the gamemaster's control most of the time. The easiest way to handle
it is, whenever the player rolls a Critical Failure but something bad
happens (in addition to taking away the highest die in the roll). The
gamemaster can choose from not allowing the player to reroll Critical
Successes until the end of the scene, the character losing an action
during the next round, or invoking some sort of strange but not too
terrible "bad luck effect."

Example: *A character with Bad Luck is running from a group of
mercenaries that he's been ﬁghting for some time. He tries to jump across
a reactor shaft when the player rolls a Critical Failure on the dice. Well,
the character probably failed in the climb/jump attempt (so he falls), but,
instead of being able to grab for a cable or a lower ledge, the character's
belt gets caught on a hook. Now, the character has to free himself before
the mercs come around the corner and blow him away.*

Restrictions/Notes: A character may take Bad Luck (R2) if he
already has the Good Luck or Great Luck Special Ability. The character
might even, on occasion, use the beneﬁts of the Good Luck or Great
Luck Special Ability to get out of trouble or partially negate the effects of
Bad Luck (R2) -- that's the way it works. Also, the gamemaster should
remember that the character has Bad Luck (R2) -- not the player. If
the player gets into a consistent "streak" of rolling Critical Failures on
the dice, then the gamemaster should start "skipping" the invocation
of Bad Luck (R2) occasionally -- more than three or four occurrences
of Bad Luck (R2) during an adventure is a little much.


### Bad Luck (R3) ###

The rules for this Disadvantage are the same as for Bad 
Luck (R2). However, a Critical Failure or a total equal to one
more than the die code of the skill or attribute causes Bad
Luck (R2) to activate. (For example, if the character has
5D in a skill and rolls a total of 6 on the dice -- which is one
more than the die code in the skill -- the Disadvantage comes
into play.) The effects are exactly the same, only the gamemaster
might make the setbacks more uncomfortable.

Restrictions/Notes: See Bad Luck (R2).


### Bad Luck (R4) ###

The same as Bad Luck (R2) and Bad Luck (R3), but the character suffers 
the effects on a Critical Failure or a total equal to or less than two 
more than the die code of the skill or attribute. (So, if the character 
with a skill of 5D rolls a 6 or 7, then the Disadvantage is activated.) 
The minimum effect is that the character loses her actions
on the round and probably something disastrous happens.

Restrictions/Notes: See Bad Luck (R2) and Bad Luck (R3). Since
Bad Luck (R4) can have such devastating effects, the gamemaster might
want to overrule occurrences of it. For example, if, during a standard
scene of an adventure, a character is trying to persuade a shopkeeper
to sell him an item at a better price, he might roll a low total on the
dice. The gamemaster could have something disastrous happen -- the
shopkeeper keels over with a heart attack just as the chief of police
walks in and the character is suddenly suspected of murder -- but does
it serve any purpose in the adventure? Possibly, but if it doesn't, save it
until later. Then, when the character is at the climax of the adventure
and he doesn't roll a disastrously low total -- but the gamemaster feels
a "dose of bad luck" would improve the story -- he can use that as an
excuse. Players should understand that Bad Luck is arbitrary and will
often occur at the worst possible moment.


### Burn-out (R1 or more) ###

Under a certain set of proscribed circumstances, the Advantage
goes away -- permanently. The player and the gamemaster should
work out the circumstances, with the following criteria:

1. The Burn-out should have a chance of occurring about once or
twice an adventure.

2. The Burn-out should be something the character can avoid -- but
she might not want to avoid it.

3. A logical reason for the Burn-out to occur should exist.

4. Both the player and the gamemaster operate under the knowledge that 
the Burnout will occur at some point. Some examples of when a Burn-out
could occur include:

    * An opponent soundly defeats the character in an adventure or 
    subjects him to a particular uncommon attack (and thus, for 
    example, he loses the respect ofhis Contact or foster Culture).
    
    * The character completes a particular mission of great importance 
    (this would probably only happen after several adventures, but it 
    is something the character wants to complete for some reason).

    * A character's Advantage is somehow negated (a Contact who has a 
    good chance of being killed, a piece of Equipment that someone is 
    trying to steal or destroy, etc.).

This Disadvantage is worth a number of ranks equal to one-half (rounded 
up) of the Advantage with which it's associated.

Restrictions/Notes: Any Advantage could have the possibility of 
Burn-out. Just think of a logical (or, perhaps, supernatural)
reason an Advantage would go away. There should exist a decent chance
that it could go away, but the character should have some chance of
avoiding that occurrence . . . for a while.


### Cultural Unfamiliarity (R1)###

The character is an outsider to the"mainstream" culture of the society
he spends the most time in. The player should decide on the character's
native planet, which is somewhere with a different culture than the one
he is normally in. Alternatively, he could be an android who hasn't been
programmed with all of the correct social skills. Bigots might get in the
way of the character, and the character might not always "know" things
about the setting that natives would automatically understand.
Example: *A character might be from a recognized and generally
well-liked alien species but work on Human planets. Nonetheless,
the character is from an alien culture and so might see some things
differently.

Restrictions/Notes: At the worst, gamemasters can treat the
Disadvantage like Prejudice (R1), but, most often, the character is just
unfamiliar with aspects of the mainstream. Characters cannot usually
take this Disadvantage more than once.

Gamemasters may choose to disallow this Disadvantage if their
campaigns have no single "mainstream" culture.


### Cultural Unfamiliarity (R2) ###

The character is of a culture almost totally different from the 
"mainstream" he operates in. The character should constantly make mistakes
and social gaffs. All attempts at streetwise or similar "getting around
town" skills should have +6 to the difficulty (at least). In addition, the
character should probably have trouble with the native language (he
could even take the Disadvantage Language Problems).

Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Cultural Unfamiliarity (R1).


### Cultural Unfamiliarity (R3) ###

The character is, in all respects, an alien. Whether he's from another
planet with a completely different culture or from some exotic and
near-unimaginable locale, he just doesn't ﬁt in (socially, and, most likely,
physically). Otherwise, this Disadvantage works exactly the same way
as the other rank versions.

Restrictions/Notes: See Cultural Unfamiliarity (R1).


### Debt (R1) ###

The character owes money, or something else valuable, to someone.
In most cases, some sort of lending institution or credit house exists,
and the payments aren't too arduous. The character just has a harder
time getting credit and has to turn over a substantial amount of any
proﬁts he makes on an adventure to the lender.

Restrictions/Notes: Players should take this Disadvantage if they
intend for their characters to live up to it. The character should have a
reason he doesn't want to default on the debt, which the player works
out beforehand. Also, Debt (any rank) with Enemy (any rank) can be
an interesting combination -- maybe the character is in deep to a loan
shark or a manipulative and unscrupulous lender.
A character may have this Disadvantage with the Advantage Wealth
(any rank), as long as there is some reason it can't be just paid off. A
character with Wealth (R3) (phenomenal resources) might be stuck
in a contract where he has to turn over the proﬁts of any adventure to
someone, for example -- he still has his wealth, but he has to cough up
all the little neat things and rewards he gets at the end of the adventure
(or the character has to persuade the lender/contract holder to let
him keep them).


### Debt (R2) ###

The character owes a lot of money (or something else valuable) to
someone dangerous, or the results of owing this debt are dangerous.
For example, the character could owe his life to a really strange old
scientist, and, every time that person needs a favor (usually going off
somewhere dangerous and doing something suicidal), the character
has to drop everything and go.

Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Debt (R1).


### Debt (R3) ###

The character owes almost everything to someone or something. In
the case of worldly goods, the character must turn over nearly everything
to the "lender" at the end of an adventure -- the character must "borrow" 
these things back at the beginning of the next adventure. And it
is up to the gamemaster what the "lender" gives back.
In most cases, this means the character is either Employed or under
some similar sort of restriction.

Example: *Your character might belong to a particularly strict cult or
religion. She has to tithe all worldly goods (or, at least, a large portion
of worldly goods) to the cult after every adventure. If she does not, she
would be cast out -- a fate she would not enjoy -- or even hunted and
killed. At the beginning of each adventure, the character must beg and
persuade whoever is in charge to let her have any goods she needs.*

Restrictions/Notes: Debt (R3) is so wide-sweeping that players may
not usually combine in it with the lower versions or link to individual
Advantages unless the player and the gamemaster are particularly inventive. 
A character with Debt (R3) might "owe" the possession of a Rank
3 or Rank 4 Advantage to a particular source (a character might have
received Equipment from a multiple-system-spanning megacorporation
source) and have to pay some sort of tithe (a sacriﬁce, all the money
the character obtains, etc.) to get the use of the Advantage.


### Devotion (R1) ###

The character feels compelled to take certain actions out of love, an
honor code, or a perceived duty to something else. The character may,
at times, do things he ﬁnds morally questionable in order to achieve a
greater good. With Devotion (R1), the character's beliefs do not come
into play very often.

### Devotion (R2) ###

The character with the Devotion (R2) Disadvantage believes very
strongly in something and will attempt to persuade others of the truth
of his beliefs. His patriotism or loyalty to an ideal plays a role in his
day-to-day life.


### Devotion (R3) ###

At this rank, the character's belief in the cause motivates almost all
his actions. The character would willingly die for his belief.


### Employed (R1) ###

The character has a job. Maybe the job relates to what the character
wants to do during adventures, or maybe not. Regardless, the character
wants to keep her job (or has to, for some reason), and she must take
responsibility for missing work and fulﬁlling her obligations.

Restrictions/Notes: The player and the gamemaster might have to
work to roleplay this, but an occasional conﬂict should arise between
what the character wants to do and what she has to do. The character
might even have to keep some activities secret or lose her job.
Some examples include special ops for a government or private
organization, bodyguard, mercenary, reporter, writer, holo-vid maker,
private investigator, bounty hunter, and police officer. The less freedom
the character has in making decisions during the adventure and what
she wants to do during her working hours (and perhaps even her spare
time), the greater the rank in Employed.


### Employed (R2) ###

The character works for someone, or something, that pretty much runs
his life. When he goes on adventures, he either has to go through lots of
red tape to get permission, or it's because he was assigned the mission.
As a result, the character has little free will regarding what he does or
how he does it, and he should come into conﬂict with his employer on
occasion. Also, since the character is an employee, if he is on a mission,
he usually has to turn over his share of the loot for corporate 
disposal -- he'll get something out of it, certainly, but not a full share.

Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Employed (R1). Just
make sure that"the job" is fairly inconvenient for the character, but 
there are reasons he doesn't quit. Maybe he has the Wealth Advantage 
only so long as he has the Employed (R2) Disadvantage -- that would be 
a good way of tying in the Disadvantage.


### Employed (R3) ###

The character is, essentially, a slave. This does not mean the character
is poor or without means -- just without free choice. The character
does virtually everything because he must. For example, a character might
be the head of a large corporation. But the only way things get done is
for the character to do them or be there to oversee their getting done.
Adventures only occur when they are in direct concordance with the 
interests of the "employer." In all other ways, this Disadvantage is 
like its lower rank versions.

Restrictions/Notes: See Employed under the other ranks.


### Enemy (R1) ###

An individual or group has it in for the character. An Enemy who
is a single person of power and inﬂuence no greater than the character
might actually want the character dead. An Enemy (R1) of power and
inﬂuence greater than the character simply wants to hassle the 
character for some reason. Maybe in the town the character operates, the
law enforcement authorities have his name and picture on ﬁle -- and
they'll use any excuse to run him in or hassle him because they think
of him as a troublemaker. Or, perhaps, the character's landlord throws
everything out on the street if he's one minute late with the rent, or the
character's boss always assigns him the most boring or most dangerous
missions. The Enemy does not have to have a position in the character's
life -- he can just be someone who, for some reason known to the
gamemaster (and probably the player, but not always the character),
has a grudge against the character.

Restrictions/Notes: There is no reason a player can't use this 
Disadvantage similarly to an Advantage Flaw or as a complement to other
Disadvantages or even Advantages. Maybe a character's Contact is sweet
and helpful (a secretary in the Pentagon who tells the character a little
more about the mission he's been assigned), but someone who inﬂuences
the Contact is an Enemy (the secretary's boss who has been trying to
seduce the secretary and resents the fact that the secretary likes the
character better) and sometimes makes it hard for the contact to help.
Enemy (R1) characters should either show up only  occasionally (maybe 
once during an adventure), or they should be minor annoyances that can 
only be a real problem if the character doesn't deal with them when they 
show up. Multiple Enemies of various ranks can be selected (just don't 
go overboard).


### Enemy (R2) ###

The rules are the same as for Enemy (R1), only the character is
more powerful, more annoying, and/or more a part of the character's life.

Restrictions/Notes: It should be mentioned that killing the Enemy
or running away should not get rid of the Disadvantage -- at least not
easily. At the very least, the character should have to go though a few
adventures to "remove" the Enemy from his life. Usually, the character
has to deal with the Enemy for quite a long time. Multiple Enemies can, 
of course, be selected. 


### Enemy (R3) ###

Again, the rules are the same as for Enemy (R1) and Enemy (R2).
Most likely, a group of people or a very powerful person hounds the
character, wishing to kill or otherwise remove the character from the
game setting. They often hurt people she knows and do vile deeds just
because the character won't like them. The Enemy (R3) should get
involved in, directly or indirectly, most adventures the character goes on.
Just about everything bad that happens to the character would please
the Enemy -- and he is probably responsible for a lot of them.

Restrictions/Notes: Enemy (R3) is a very powerful, and very
important, Disadvantage. Many beginning gamemasters might not want
to go to the trouble of creating and constantly maintaining a villain or
group of villains relating to the character -- but others will enjoy it.
Talk to your gamemaster about this option before you select it.


### Hindrance (R1 or more) ###

The character has a minor physical or mental handicap that makes
certain actions more difficult. The Hindrance could be a permanent 
physical injury, a particular mental block regarding certain types of 
activities, a limitation innate to the character's species, or the 
result of age. The player and the gamemaster should work out some sort of
aﬄiction and then choose a group of related skills that get difficulty
modiﬁers totaling +3. Some examples of sets of three skills getting a
+1 modiﬁer to the difficulty of each include:

* Bad Knee: acrobatics, climb/jump, running

* Rude: bargain, con, persuasion

* Trick Shoulder: climb/jump, melee combat, throwing

* Uncoordinated: acrobatics, melee combat, sleight of hand

* Unobservant: investigation, languages, search

The players may use this Disadvantage to restrict one form of their
characters' movement. A two-meter reduction in one form of movement 
(running, swimming, jumping, or climbing) is equivalent to a +1
difficulty modiﬁer, so a player could take a small movement restriction
along with difficulty modiﬁers to skills. The minimum movement rate
for a character is one meter.

Characters with a native environment requiring an alternative means
of movement other than walking (such as swimming or burrowing) may
take one rank of Hindrance: Atypical Move to represent the inability
to walk or jump. Instead, the character uses his base Move to represent 
his base swimming or burrowing Move. Thus, a water-dwelling
character without legs and with this type of Hindrance would have a
swimming Move of 10 (instead of 5), could not walk, and would be
limited in the kind of jumping he could perform.

Players who wish to reduce their characters' damage resistance total
(to represent delicate physical natures) may take a -1 modiﬁer to that
total for each rank in this Disadvantage.

Restrictions/Notes: Players may use specializations -- with gamemaster 
approval. Three specializations that the gamemaster thinks the
player might have to use reasonably often (like investigation: ﬁnd clues
or ﬁrearms: energy weapons) could substitute for one general skill. 
Hindrance (R1) can be selected several times, as long as the gamemaster
thinks it appropriate. Since it is very much the counterpart to the Skill
Bonus Special Ability, additional restrictions and notes can be related
to the ones found there. Each additional rank in Hindrance increases the 
total difficulty modiﬁer by +3, which may affect the few skills in a 
Rank 1 group or can increase the number of skills covered by the Hindrance.


### Infamy (R1) ###

The character is about as well known as a character with Fame
(R1), but for different reasons. The odds of being recognized are
the same as for Fame (R1), but the reaction is quite different. The 
character experiences hostility, prejudice, and intentional 
slights -- in game mechanic terms, the character should have the 
difficulty of all interactions increased by at least +3.

Restrictions/Notes: There is a reason for this negative attention.
Either the character did something, is accused of having done something,
or is suspected of having done something not particularly pleasant, or
the character has, through other strange circumstances, earned a "bad
rep." Sometimes, this Infamy will help the character -- but it shouldn't
help too much. If the character has a combination of Fame and Infamy
(by selecting both options), then maybe he's earned a reputation like
Wyatt Earp or Jesse James in the Old Terran Old West -- certain people
would look up to him or respect him, and there would be deﬁnite fear
there most of the time, but there would also be a lot of people who
would enjoy seeing the person leave or die. Of course, Infamy (R1)
should be something minor -- maybe the character is a former criminal,
or he did something questionable in the past and was cleared. People
are not overtly hostile, but they are unfriendly when they recognize
him. Several ranks of Infamy can only be selected if the character is
infamous for multiple reasons -- but the effects should be cumulative,
and this can only be done if the gamemaster thinks it is appropriate. A
character with Infamy (R3) would hardly have to worry about Infamy
(R1) in most cases, so it would not be a proper combination.


### Infamy (R2) ###

The character is, most likely, wanted for a crime of a fairly serious
nature, or he did something (or is thought to have done something) in
the past that makes him hated and reviled by most people. The rules are
essentially the same as for Infamy (R1) and the recognition chances are
similar to Fame (R2), but the modiﬁer to interactions usually should
be at least +6.

Restrictions/Notes: As stated under Infamy (R1), unless combined with
Fame, this Disadvantage only allows for the negative aspects of notoriety. 
A character who has Infamy (R2) would be considered by nearly everyone 
(but not everyone) to be"scum" and someone who "deserves no better than 
he gets." When combined with an equal or higher rank of Fame, there is 
often that "fear and respect" option -- many characters will still try 
to betray or hurt the character in some way, but most won't be that
open about it.


### Infamy (R3) ###

The character has trouble going out in public because a lot of people hate
her to the point of violence. Chances are good that, if she fails an 
interaction (with a +9 to the difficulty), the other person will drive her 
away. The player could select Enemy (R1) in addition to this Disadvantage 
to reﬂect those hunting her. However, the character could use disguises 
and avoid populated areas. Most likely, the character has to move around 
until she can "live down" her infamy (if ever) or until she dies.

Restrictions/Notes: See Infamy (R1) and Infamy (R2).


### Language Problems (R2) ### 

The character does not understand the language of the area she spends 
most of her time in. She must learn skill pips in the specialization 
languages: (local language). She also receives a +6 difficulty modiﬁer in 
addition to any other modiﬁers for what she's attempting to convey or 
understand.

Restrictions/Notes: The character cannot begin the game with more than 
one pip in languages: (local language), but she may improve the skill 
at +2 to the cost. However, the character should speak another language
in the game setting ﬂuently.


### Learning Problems (R1 or more) ###

When the character attempts to learn a new skill, or improve an old one, 
he does so at +2 per rank to the Character Point cost. Alternatively, 
the character can only learn or improve a skill if she attempts it and 
fails. A character should have to fail with a single skill at least three 
times per adventure before being allowed to learn or improve the skill.
This Disadvantage is associated with a single attribute, and it
applies to specializations. There should be some sort of reason for
this in the character's background, such as a difficulty reading or a
lack of education.

Restrictions/Notes: This is the counterpart to the Quick Study
Special Ability, and it should be treated in much the same way. This
Disadvantage can be taken multiple times, either for the same attribute
(with a cumulative increase in skill cost) or for different attributes.


### Poverty (R1) ###

Since characters who adventure tend to accumulate wealth, this
Disadvantage is only available at Rank 1. The character begins the
game with the shirt on his back and, maybe, a few pieces of cheap and
substandard equipment. The character should also have the attitude of
someone who is "poor," whatever that might be in the game setting.
If using Funds as an attribute, this Disadvantage subtracts 10 from
relevant totals.

Restrictions/Notes: As an excellent combination, this Disadvantage could 
be selected with Debt or Price to make the situation more realistic. 
Poverty can only be selected once.


### Prejudice (R1) ###

The character is of a minority group -- or maybe it is just the
character himself -- that is subject to prejudice and discrimination.
The character receives modiﬁers (from +2 to +4) to difficulties during
normal interaction with characters not of the minority group, and is
generally treated unfairly by society. The group the character belongs
to, or the reason he is discriminated against, should be identiﬁed 
when the character gets this Disadvantage, and the player should know how
he can expect to be treated in most cases.

Restrictions/Notes: The gamemaster has to be careful with this one. 
Roleplaying prejudice is not often something players want to get into.
When used in a setting where there are many different sapient species, 
however, it can be quite interesting -- especially if there are several 
characters in the group who are prejudiced against.


### Prejudice (R2) ###

The minority group the character belongs to is oppressed. The character
experiences disparity virtually every day. While other
characters of the same minority group may not actually experience
this prejudice (that is, they didn't select this option), it is probably
because they aren't in positions where this discrimination can be easily 
practiced.

Restrictions/Notes: The character often experiences discrimination, 
and most interactions are performed at a +3 to +6 to the difficulty.
This prejudice should be roleplayed at every opportunity. However,
gamemasters and players should only use this Disadvantage when
both sides are comfortable with using it in a pretend situation (see
Prejudice (R1) for more information).


### Price (R1) ###

This is a Disadvantage similar to Advantage Flaw. But, instead of
there being something wrong with the character's Advantage or a set
of three related skills, there is a "price tag" attached. Every time the
character wants to use the ability, he has to pay a Price at least a few
times during the adventure to continue using the ability.

The Price might be an actual fee -- and a signiﬁcant one at that. If
the fee isn't paid, the Advantage goes away until the price can be paid.
But this won't work for many Advantages (at least not in an interesting
manner), so there are other ways to do it.

Most likely, the Price will be a roleplaying effect. Maybe every time
a Contact does a favor for a character, he not only demands the normal,
negotiated recompense (if any), but the character must do a favor of
equal importance for the character. Or, whenever a piece of Equipment
is used, parts of it need replacing or servicing by a specialist (who may
charge a high fee or ask a favor), most likely after the adventure.

One more suggestion for Price (R1) would be that the character
has to pay one Fate Point or three Character Points at the end of an
adventure where the Advantage or skills were relied upon, to "pay for"
the usage. This reﬂects the fact that the use of the Advantage or skills
take something out of the character when they are accessed.

Restrictions/Notes: The Price should be fairly easy to meet, but it
should take some work. At this rank, it should be something that the
character can roleplay along with an adventure or resolve between short
adventures or parts of longer adventures (like paying off the recipient
of the Price). However, if the character does not pay the Price, the
Advantage does go away -- and, if (in the gamemaster's opinion) the
character does this too often, both the Advantage and the Price should
go away permanently. Price can be taken often at various ranks, and
the same Price can be linked to more than one Advantage -- though,
unless the Price is actually double (the character has to pay the same
price twice as often), it only counts as one Disadvantage.


### Price (R2) ###

The Price for using a particular Advantage, or group of Advantages
or set of three related skills, is much higher than mentioned in Rank 1,
but the rules are the same. Contacts will be extremely hard to pay off
or do favors for -- maybe an entire short adventure has to be devoted
to paying back a contact who helped out.

Optionally, paying two Fate Points or six Character Points at the
end of an adventure where the Advantage was used is a quick way of
paying the price.

Restrictions/Notes: See Price (R1) for more information.


## Quirk (R1) ###

The character suffers from a personality quirk that makes certain
types of roleplaying and interaction more difficult. This Quirk could
simply be a habit or a mannerism that has gone too far, or it could be
a minor psychological problem. Some examples include:

* Dependency: The character has a slight dependency on a substance
or even a roleplaying event. The character might be a pack-a-day smoker
who, if he doesn't get a cigarette at least once every few hours of game
time, gets irritable and loses Critical Success rerolls during interactions.
Or maybe the character always has to have the last word in any situation
and will often beat an argument into the ground rather than "lose."

* Kleptomania: When in a store or surrounded by small, portable
items, the character will occasionally try to "lift" something. When
possessed by his Quirk (see rules below), the character suffers +3 to
the difficulty of sleight of hand or related attempts at theft because he
really doesn't know he's doing it.

* Indecision: The character does not like making decisions and will
delay making them. When roleplaying, the character should actively
participate in group discussions, but he should be wishy-washy and
indecisive at critical moments.

* Stutter: When under pressure, relaxed, nervous (such as failing a
skill roll), or some other fairly common "mood" hits the character, he
stutters. The upshot is the character suffers +3 to the difficulty of any
interaction at this time, and the player should roleplay having a hard
time getting his ideas across to the other players. This lasts until the
player rolls a Critical Success.

Restrictions/Notes: Good roleplayers will have fun with these,
and other, Quirks that they come up with. Indeed, this Disadvantage is
often more fun to play than many Advantages -- but the gamemaster
should make certain it is being roleplayed. Whenever the gamemaster
thinks it appropriate, he should make the player generate a willpower
or Knowledge total against a base Moderate difficulty to "indulge" in
his Quirk automatically (that is, "suffer" for it). The negative effects of
the Quirk immediately come into play. Also, if the character repeatedly
makes this roll, resisting the impulses of the Quirk, the gamemaster
should start modifying the difficulty upwards until the character fails.
Multiple Quirks can be selected.

Quirks may offer variable difficulty modiﬁers depending on the
circumstances. The more likely that the Quirk affects the character,
the less it actually should do in each situation.

Example: *A character who has a fear of water might might "panic"
and suffer +3 to the difficulty of all actions when exposed to a large
body of water, +5 when in it, and +3 when wet.*

Additional Note: Some players may choose to have their characters
roleplay Quirks they already have or might like to play. Sometimes this
works; sometimes it doesn't. It can be hysterical to have a player "steal"
dice out from under another player's nose (symbolizing the fact that
the character is taking necessary items away from the other player's
character) as long as things don't go too far -- that is, when people
start getting upset. However, players who are "indecisive" should not
play characters who are indecisive -- since they would be anyway. This
is too much like getting a Disadvantage for nothing.


### Quirk (R2) ###

The rules for Quirk (R2) are the same as for Quirk (R1), only the
chance of occurrence is much greater and the effects are larger.

* Dependency: The character needs to fulﬁll his dependency much
more often (once a scene, perhaps). The character also experiences one
automatic Critical Failure per scene that he doesn't (a smoker might
have a coughing ﬁt in the middle of a tense negotiation or during a
sneak attempt, for example).

* Secret: There's something about the character that she needs to
hide. If it were discovered, it would put her friends, family, and even
her own life at risk. This could be a civilian identity (if she has a heroic
alter ego) or a skeleton in the closet.

Restrictions/Notes: The difficulty of resisting the "impulse" is now
Difficult, but all other rules are the same as under Quirk (R1).


### Quirk (R3) ###

These "personality quirks" are much more serious. The character
might be a junkie, a psychotic with a certain type of behavior, or has a
severe phobia (he's deathly afraid of something). Some examples:

* Dependency: The character is a junkie, always after a "ﬁx." The "ﬁx"
might be an illegal substance, or a perfectly normal one, or even a type
of roleplaying interaction (maybe the character has to try to come as
close to dying as he can).

* Paranoid: The character trusts no one. He receives a +6 to the
bonus number when trying to resist con attempts, but he also receives
this "bonus" when trying to be persuaded -- and he must be persuaded
before he'll help even his closest friends. "Everyone is out to get him."

* Phobic: The character is deathly afraid of something. It could be
heights, open spaces, spiders, or another person (such as an authority
ﬁgure or one with whom he has frightening memories). Unless the
character makes his willpower roll (below), she dissolves into terror
and may take no actions other than hiding or running away until away
from the object of fear.


### Authority (R1) ###

Vengeful: The character cannot stand to "lose" or be "wronged." If
the character perceives herself as looking foolish (or whatever), she
will go to great lengths to get even (in reality, the character probably
takes it too far).

Restrictions/Notes: The character has to make a Very Difficult
Knowledge or willpower roll to overcome the Quirk -- at the least. If,
in the gamemaster's judgment, there is a reason the character should
have modiﬁers to the difficulty, then he will. Players who don't want
to play a character that can frequently lose control should avoid this
option. Other rules are the same as under Quirk (R1)

The gamemaster may allow higher versions of this Disadvantage,
with larger modiﬁers and an increase of +5 per rank to the willpower
difficulty.


### Reduced Attribute (R2) ###

Something about the character's species, age, physical condition, or
some other factor has permanently reduced one attribute by one pip
per rank. The character may not reduce the attribute die code below
1D, and the attribute die code may never be increased by spending
Character Points (though gaining a Special Ability would help).

Restrictions/Notes: With the exception of permanently
restricting access to an Extranormal attribute, a player may not
give a character this Disadvantage at character creation.
Only one rank may be taken with an Extranormal attribute of
0D, and the character's species must be required to take at least
1D in the affected attribute. Characters who have this Disadvantage
on an Extranormal attribute before having any die code in that 
attribute may never take that Extranormal attribute.

The reduction in die code increases by one pip for each
additional rank taken in this Disadvantage. (Remember that three
pips equal one die.) The character may have different variations on 
this Disadvantage for each attribute, including Extranormal attributes, 
such as Metaphysics.


Advantages
==========

### Authority (R1) ###

The character has some measure of power over other people in his
region. The scope of the character's rank, duties, and power in his local
jurisdiction dictate the rank in this Advantage. An Authority (R1)
Advantage might belong to someone who, because of circumstance,
does not have a lot of opportunity to use his authority or someone
who is very low in rank.

Law Enforcement is one version of this Advantage that gives
adventurers some measure of abilities associated with being a deputized 
agent of the law. Authority: Law Enforcement (R1) means the
character has limited authority to enforce the law on a single planet.
Private investigators, bounty hunters, and bail bondsmen would need
this Advantage.

Restrictions/Notes: It is not necessary to have the Authority: Law
Enforcement Advantage to own a ﬁrearm parts of space that allow
ordinary citizens to own them. However, if owning a gun is illegal on
a planet, solar system, or galactic empire, and thus limited to deputized
officials, then this version of the Advantage would be necessary.
Remember, too, that outside of the character's jurisdiction or permit
limits, this Advantage may have little or no value.


### Authority (R2) ###

Same as Authority (R1), but the character has more inﬂuence,
possibly commanding a small number of troops or being in charge of a small
company or town. With Authority: Law Enforcement (R2), the character is
actually a law enforcement officer and is allowed to make full arrests 
and reasonable search and seizures (as dictated by planetary laws).

Restrictions/Notes: See Authority (R1) for more information.


### Authority (R3) ###

Same as Authority (R1), except that the character has a great deal of 
power and inﬂuence. The head of a large company or someone whose 
authority is simply never questioned would have this Advantage.
With Authority: Law Enforcement (R3), the character may enforce the law 
on multiple planets in a system.

Restrictions/Notes: Higher levels of Authority indicate a wider sphere 
of inﬂuence, such as multiple systems, a single galaxy, or time. 
Otherwise, see Authority (R1) for more information.


### Contacts (R1) ###

The character "knows somebody" or a group of somebodies who
will generally help out the character if he makes a decent appeal or
sufficiently compensates the contact. This level of contact only sticks
around for a limited amount of time (part of an adventure or maybe
throughout a short adventure).

The character might know a "group" with a wider range of inﬂuence
(but less power) that will help out, again, for a modest fee or under
the right circumstances. The inﬂuence might not be as direct, but it is
easier to come by. For example, there might be clubs or organizations
that provide certain services for travelers -- navigation coordinates to
common systems, accommodation reservations, emergency transportation, 
and so on -- for a small membership fee. You have to call them
or go to their offices, and they won't do much about that maniac with
the blaster who is chasing you, but they can be of immense help under
the right circumstances.

Restrictions/Notes: Contacts should not automatically help the
character, but they should be reasonable in their negotiations. Multiple
contacts of various ranks may be selected and they may be stacked. For
example, a certain person might be a Contact (R1) in most circumstances, 
but he could be a Contact (R2) or even a Contact (R3) in the right 
place -- for example, a mercenary might help out for a fee versus
normal foes, but when ﬁghting his "hereditary enemies," he might be
almost invincible and eager to help.

Remember that contacts are gamemaster characters. They should
be created and played rationally. If a player refuses to roleplay or takes
advantage of contacts, he should be penalized when trying to use them
(and possibly lose them). There should also be a reason in the character's
story why he has these contacts.


### Contacts (R2) ###

This Advantage is identical to Contacts (R1), except the contact
is more powerful, more inﬂuential, easier to get hold of, willing to do
more favors, or affects the game on a larger scale.

If the contact is supposed to be a large group, it now has much
greater inﬂuence over a wider area. For instance, instead of belonging
to a travel club, the character might have a government agency to help
him out occasionally.

Restrictions/Notes: Under no circumstances should any contact,
regardless of rank number, make roleplaying and thinking superﬂuous. 
Contacts are totally under the control of the gamemaster. Even
powerful and inﬂuential contacts from this rank should be kept under
a tight rein. See Contacts (R1) for more information.


### Contacts (R3) ###

The contact or contacts chosen should be nearly supernormal,
supernatural, or uncanny in origin or far reaching in scope. For
example, a character's Contact (R3) might be an "spacefarer's guild"
with multi-system branch offices and an impressive ability to get its
members the oddest things.

Work with the gamemaster to come up with some interesting contacts. 
It might be a group of psionic monks who can be called upon for
"mental aid" -- or maybe a really complete technical library.

Restrictions/Notes: Again, as with Contacts (R1) and (R2), don't
let the contacts take over the game -- and don't let the player's character
abuse them. Contacts are gamemaster controlled, but they will usually
only be brought into play at the character's request.


### Contacts (R4) ###

There is some sort of strange "force" that "watches over" and occasionally 
helps the character. In many ways, this Advantage is not as
useful in most adventure situations as the other versions of Contacts,
but it can have dramatic effects on occasion.

Some examples of this include a particularly powerful gamemaster
character who steps in occasionally to help the character when he's in
trouble. Or, a large governmental agency might, for some reason, want
to step in and aid the character at times.

Generally, the character can get minor assistance -- as could be
gotten from Contacts (R1) or Contacts (R2) -- on a fairly regular basis
-- and under the same sort of circumstances as having lower versions
of Contacts -- but "the big stuff " only happens when the gamemaster
thinks it appropriate. The character might get killed before the Contacts
(R4) intervenes -- maybe the character just wasn't doing something
the Contact felt was important to it -- but, most likely, assistance
come, though perhaps at the last minute.

Restrictions/Notes: Players' characters should take this option
only if they want to take Disadvantages relating to it. For example, if
a character in a space opera campaign wants to have a group of 
superscientists who like him and will supply him with substantial aid on a
regular basis (like a space ranger who gets outﬁtted with new equipment
at the beginning of every adventure and who can call for more during
certain times in the adventure), then he should take Disadvantages
that relate to that. The character could be a member of an organization
(see the Disadvantage Employed), or he must do reciprocating favors
for the providing company (see the Disadvantage Price), or there are
equally powerful people who want to eliminate him because of his
contacts (see the Disadvantage Enemy).

If the character does not want to take extensive Disadvantages relating 
to the contact, then Contacts (R4) should be unpredictable and not
always useful. For example, the company might provide the character 
with plenty of extraordinary equipment, but it might not always be
what the character needs or might not work correctly all of the time.

### Contacts, Patrons, Enemies###

Having friends in high places often means the character
attracts the attention of the friends' friends... and enemies.
Players willing to roleplay long, associative networks may add
lower-level Contacts in exchange for an equivalent number
of Ranks in one or more Enemies. The player must purchase
one Contact or Patron of Rank 2 or greater. All additional
Contacts and Enemies must be associated with that primary
Contact or Patron. As long as the total number of Ranks in
the additional Contacts equals the total number of Ranks
in the Enemies, the Enemies do not count toward the Disadvantage 
maximum.

Example: *A player decides to have a Rank 3 Patron. The
player may then add any number of Rank 1 or 2 Contacts as
long as she adds an equal number of Enemies. If she chose to
add three Rank 1 Contacts (well-placed personal assistants
to the Patron), the player would have to think of three Rank
1 Enemies, or one Rank 1 and one Rank 2 Enemy, or one
Rank 3 Enemy that this Patron has.*

### Equipment (R3)###

Items of equipment that are normally unavailable to just about anyone
can be picked up using this Advantage. Any one item on any equipment
chart can be selected, or the gamemaster can make up a"special" item that
has unusual effects or Special Abilities. Alternatively, they can just be
really expensive or virtually unavailable items.

Equipment totaling a few tens of thousands of dollars (or a price 
difficulty of Heroic) falls under this category.

Restrictions/Notes: The gamemaster should watch this Advantage carefully. 
It can only be selected once at character creation -- though the Rank 1 
and Rank 2 versions can also be selected -- but it can still unbalance
a beginning character. Generally, things that can be taken away fairly 
easily -- like energy swords, military hardware, super-science gadgets, 
and other related equipment -- would be suitably appropriate for 
characters with minimal experience.


### Equipment (R1) ###

The character gains a piece of equipment he would not
normally have because it is too expensive or"unavailable,"
but only if it is allowable under the game setting. For
instance, a character could start the game with a small
laser pistol, but not a mini rocket launcher -- unless the
gamemaster runs a lawless setting, as the latter is quite
powerful, it should be generally unavailable for civilian 
use and even characters with military backgrounds should
have to take the Equipment (R2) Advantage to get it.
Alternatively, the character could take lots of little pieces of 
equipment instead -- more than what the gamemaster would normally allow.
Basically, equipment totaling in cost not more than about 1,000 credits
(or a price difficulty of Moderate) would ﬁt in this category.
Restrictions/Notes: Typically, as long as the character is not careless
with it, Equipment taken with any rank of this Advantage is replaceable,
unless the Burn-out Disadvantage is included with it. Equipment (R1)
may be selected more than once or in combination with higher ranks
of the Equipment Advantage with gamemaster approval.


### Equipment (R2) ###

The character gains a piece of equipment that would be difficult
to obtain because of expense or availability. Weapons that are usually
out of reach of the normal citizen are available. Similarly, equipment
totaling in cost not more than several thousand credits (or a price
difficulty of Difficult) would probably be okay. In game settings that
have rare alien technology, objects of fairly low power probably could
be obtained using this Advantage.

Restrictions/Notes: See Equipment (R1) for more information.
Equipment (R2) may be selected more than once or in combination with
higher ranks of the Equipment Advantage with gamemaster approval.


### Equipment (R4) ###

Really bizarre and, most likely, powerful equipment is open to the 
character -- but only one such piece or a collection of small, related 
pieces. For very powerful items, no one else can use the equipment 
without making some sort of exhaustive skill total, and it can probably
not be repaired or duplicated."Special effects" equipment ﬁts into 
this category. The equipment could be a weapon more powerful than most 
personal weapons in the game setting. Or it could be a Metaphysics 
manipulation that could not normally be used by the character or anyone 
else in the world at its relatively low difficulty. Or it could be a 
collection of gadgets and gizmos that can perform many different 
mundane tasks -- but how, nobody knows. 

Restrictions/Notes: The character should have Disadvantages
related to the equipment. Maybe Enemies want to steal it, or it has
an Advantage Flaw so it doesn't work all the time -- or the same way
every time. In addition, the equipment should not make the character
so powerful that opponents fall before him. In game mechanic terms,
the equipment should be a just slightly more powerful or more useful
item than what is available normally. The more powerful the item, the
more Disadvantages and restrictions should be related to it.

Example: *A player might choose to give her character an average blaster
and increase the damage score by two points. As this is a modest 
adjustment, her gamemaster also allows the gun to never need reloading.*


### Fame (R1) ###

The character, for some reason, is fairly well known. The extent of
the character's fame should be determined by the game setting. In a
global game setting, the character has moderate recognition value in
a particular region. In a smaller game setting (like post-nuclear war
settings restricted to one planet), the character might have more dense
penetration of recognition, but with less wide-sweeping effects (for
instance, everyone in town knows who they are, but no one from more
than a few days' travel away has ever heard of them).

Whenever the gamemaster thinks the character might be recognized
(and the Fame Advantage would come into play), the gamemaster should
roll 3D. If the result is 15 or higher, the character is recognized. 
Otherwise, he will have to do something "special" and appropriate for why
he's famous to be recognized (and gain the beneﬁts of recognition).

If a character with Fame (R1) is recognized, he should gain small
perks, like being seated in a restaurant early, avoiding small legal hassles
(like routine customs checks), or just be treated generally better 
(perhaps the character gets a couple of bonus points to persuasion, con, 
and command attempts). Like most roleplayed Advantages, the gamemaster
should decide on the results.

Restrictions/Notes: Fame may be chosen multiple times as long as
the player deﬁnes how each Fame is different. For example, a character
might have Fame (R1) in regards to his ﬁghting abilities, but another
type of Fame pertaining to his intelligence or some other ability.


### Fame (R2)###

The character is very well known. In a global setting, the character
would probably be recognized in most fairly civilized cultures and
almost deﬁnitely in her home culture. The gamemaster should roll 3D
and, on a 15 or higher, a person from another culture recognizes the
person and react (usually favorably). In the character's own culture,
this reaction comes on an 8 or more. If the character draws attention
to herself in her own culture (identiﬁes herself ), then the reaction will
most likely be automatic (gamemaster's option).

Restrictions/Notes: At this level of fame, the character should be
treated like a famous author, an occasional holo-vid star, or a reasonably
recognizable sports ﬁgure. Some gamemaster characters will be immune
to this fame, but most will have some sort of (generally positive) 
reaction. Otherwise, see Fame (R1) for more information.


### Fame (R3) ###

There is a pretty good chance anyone in the game setting (unless
it is a multi-world setting) will recognize the character (or what the
character is) fairly easily. The base die total needed is 8, and it can be
modiﬁed by circumstance. The character has the status of a holo-vid
star, a famous politician, or a top-ranked sports hero.

Restrictions/Notes: As with Fame (R1) and Fame (R2) -- certain
people just won't be impressed. In addition, characters with Fame (R3)
should almost always have to take the Disadvantage Infamy at least
Rank 1 -- no matter how nice, talented, or generally well-liked a person
is, there's always somebody out there who wishes them harm.


### Patron (R1) ###

The odds are that most players' characters are not independently
wealthy. But they might have access to wealth in the form of patrons.
If the characters are treasure hunters, patrons might include museums,
universities, private philanthropists, news agencies, megacorporations,
or even retired adventurers.

Patron (R1) means the character has a backer who will fund one
expedition, with all proceeds going to the patron. All of the costs
(room, board, travel, expenses) are covered by the patron, with the
understanding that the player's character is basically just a 
worker-forhire. Anything that the adventurer discovers or purchases 
becomes the property of the patron.


### Patron (R2) ###

A Patron (R2) expects much less from those she backs. Though
the character may receive less ﬁnancial support, she gains a greater
freedom of action.

A news agency looking for hot stories is a common example of an
organization qualifying for Patron (R2). They cover a character's travel
expenses and any legal fees in exchange for inspiring stories. Anything
that the character ﬁnds on his own (like artifacts) remain his own.


### Patron (R3) ###

A Patron (R3) gives a character a limited stipend and covers most
expenses, then offers to purchase whatever the character recovers.
Without consistent results, the funding will be cut off.


### Size (R1 or more) ###

The character is much larger or smaller than the average Human.
For every rank in this Advantage, the player receives up to +3 to his
character's scale modiﬁer (which starts at zero). The player must specify
whether the character is bigger or smaller than the average Human.

Restrictions/Notes: Generally, the character's weight is proportional 
for his height, but a Disadvantage, such as Hindrance: Reduced
Toughness, or a Special Ability, such as Hardiness, could be used to
represent a very thin or very large character (respectively). Likewise, to
reﬂect a longer stride, the character should have the Hypermovement
Special Ability, while a shorter stride would get the Hindrance: Shorter
Stride Disadvantage. Obviously, no character may take the Size: Large
and the Size: Small Advantages.


### Trademark Specialization (R1) ###

This Advantage works a lot like a combination of the Skill Bonus
Special Ability and Fame. The character excels at one very speciﬁc thing,
and he is known for it. Choose any specialization that the character
has (or would like to have in the future), and the character gains +2D
to the roll when it is used. In addition, when the character uses it, at
the gamemaster's option, people acknowledge how"naturally good" the
character is at the specialization, and this might produce interesting
situations. Also, the character might be contacted or recognized by
certain people because of how good he is at that one specialization.

Restrictions/Notes: This character acts as if trained in the use
of this skill. No character may have more than two Trademark Specializations.


### Wealth (R1 or more) ###

The character with this Advantage probably has an estate or a
series of investments that will keep him comfortable for a good long
time. Alternatively, the character could be minor nobility, have a large
trust fund, or be married to the owner of a large corporation. This
doesn't mean the character can buy everything -- he is still subject to
the availability of items.

For each rank in this Advantage, the characters has 5,000 credits in
readily available cash once per month. The accounts never have more
than 5,000 credits times the number of ranks each month (fees and
living expenses keep it to that level); the amount could be less by the end
of the month. Additionally, adventure bonuses could temporarily raise
the ﬁgure, though the character would have to purchase an additional
rank of Wealth to make the increase permanent. Players in games using
the Funds attribute gain +2 per rank to all such totals.

Restrictions/Notes: Characters should select only one rank of
Wealth, unless there is some reason they might have Wealth (R1) and
another rank of Wealth in other circumstances. Also, this wealth does
not always help and disappears if misused (and it should be a major
concern to the character at times), but it should be there most of the
time. Gamemasters will probably think of ways to work around wealth
and players should play along -- if you can throw money at every
problem, then they aren't that much fun to try to solve, are they?

The most likely Disadvantage a character with Wealth would have
is Devotion, such as "helping all those in need" or "righting all wrong
doing." Otherwise, there should be fairly extensive reasons why the
character can't use his wealth to resolve every situation -- or hire
somebody to do it for him (which is really the same thing).


Special Abilities
-----------------

Before allowing players to create characters with Special Abilities,
the gamemaster may wish to peruse this list to see if there are any
she would prefer not to appear in her games. She may also decide
that certain Special Abilities require speciﬁc Limitations on
them or Disadvantages on the character.

Any Special Ability that gives a bonus to the die roll or
the skill total also allows the character to use that skill as if
trained. Bonuses received from taking multiple ranks of the
same Special Ability are added together.

Skills gained with a Special Ability are not improved when
that Special Ability is improved. Instead, they are increased as a
normal skill. 

Unless stated otherwise in the Special Ability, it does
not count as an action for the character to get the bonus
from a Special Ability. However, except for such automatic
abilities as Natural Armor or Combat Sense, the character
must state that she is relying on the Special Ability or she 
does not receive the bonus.


### Accelerated Healing (3) ###

The character gains a +1D per rank to his Strength for all natural
healing attempts, and a Critical Failure is treated as 1, rather than
having a negative effect on the die roll.


### Ambidextrous (2) ###

The character is equally adept with her right or left hand. She may
perform an action with each hand in the same round, and, though she
takes the multi-action penalty, she receives a +1 per rank to each skill
total. The actions must involve the hands and each action must require
only one hand. If the character performs only one hand-related action
in a round, she does not get the bonus. Some skills that characters
could employ with either hand include brawling, sleight of hand, ﬁrearms,
throwing, lift, artist, forgery, and the map-making aspect of navigation,
though, of course, not every task covered by each skill is relevant. A
character may take multiple ranks of this Special Ability for two pairs
of hands and multiple ranks for each additional manipulative limb.


### Animal Control (3) ###

This gives the character the ability to control one particular species
of animal, bird, or insect. The character gets a +10 bonus to her survival:
animal handling total for that species. She must generate a survival:
animal handling versus the Knowledge or willpower of the animal (more
than one animal can be targeted, although this is a multi-action). If
the character gets a high enough success (gamemaster's decision), the
animal is controlled for a number of minutes equal to the survival:
animal handling skill total times 10. A controlled animal serves its 
master faithfully, even sacriﬁcing itself on her behalf. The
Special Ability has a range of sight or voice.
The character may gain one more species for each rank.

Note: A swarm of insects counts as one animal, as does a school of small 
ﬁsh. Any creature with a Knowledge die code of less than 2D could be 
considered an animal, unless the gamemaster says otherwise.


### Armor-Defeating Attack (2) ###

When a character with natural weapons (the character's ﬁsts, claws, 
teeth, etc.) attacks someone protected by armor, this ability negates 
the Armor Value, up to +1D per rank. The character must specify how
the attack negates the armor: an acidic mist slips through any openings, 
nanotech claws reach directly to the ﬂesh, and the like. There should 
be at least one type of armor that is unaffected by this.


### Atmospheric Tolerance (2) ###

The character can breathe one form of atmosphere (gas or liquid)
that would be lethal to most other characters. A character may not have
more than one rank in this ability, but he may have different versions
for different atmospheres.


### Attack Resistance (2) ###

The character is highly resistant to a certain type of attack. She
gains +1D per rank to her damage resistance total against this type
of attack.

* Energy Attacks: Resistant to blasts of heat, ﬁre, electricity, 
radiation, light, cold, and so on, but not the ability to survive in 
extremes of such environments.

* Extranormal Attack: Resistant to damage from any Extranormal based 
(such as Metaphysics) attack. 

* Mental Attacks: Resistant to mental harm from any source. It does
not provide protection against interaction attempts.


### Attribute Scramble (4) ###

The character can adjust an opponent's (or a friend's) attributes 
temporarily. She gains the scramble skill at +1 per rank in a single 
version of this Special Ability (it is a Perception skill, described 
only here), which she also can increase as a normal skill. The scrambler 
must pick as her focus either physical or mental attributes, though 
never Extranormal, Funds, or Special Abilities. (Physical attributes 
encompass Agility, Strength, and Mechanical. Mental attributes include 
Knowledge, Perception, and Technical.) She only may do both by taking 
this Special Ability once for each version.

When she goes after a target with an brawling roll, she may choose
(as a multi-action) to also perform a scramble attack versus a roll of
her target's willpower or Knowledge. (This is not an action for the 
target.) No close combat attack is necessary for a willing target, though
the willpower or Knowledge must still be made. However, the act of
scrambling still counts as an action.

If the scrambler's total is higher (not equal to), she may shift her
target's attribute points around, within certain limits. The close combat
attack does no damage.

She may increase one or more related attributes by a number equal to
the amount she takes away from other related attributes -- but she may
not decrease or increase any one attribute by more than 2D (6 pips).

The change lasts for a number of rounds equal to the difference
between the scramble attack and the target's willpower or Knowledge.
A character who has been adjusted cannot be scrambled again until
the original adjustment wears off.


### Blur (3) ###

The character can appear indistinct to the naked eye or most visual
aids (binoculars, cameras, etc.). Commonly, a character with this Special
Ability will only be spotted out of the corner of the eye. This adds 1 to
the character's dodge, sneak, and hide totals, as well as +1 to all default
search, investigation, and attack difficulties against the character that
the blurring character is not actively trying to defeat. (These modiﬁers
are per rank in this Special Ability.) On the character's turn, she may
automatically become blurry, without taking an action, and remain
so until she chooses otherwise. Blurring also makes it difficult for the
character to hold a conversation with others.


### Combat Sense (3) ###

The character can sense danger. She is never surprised. Rather,
she and her attacker must determine initiative as normal. Even if the
attacker still goes before the character does, any combat modiﬁer from
the surprise is reduced by 2. A character may not have this ability
more than once.


### Confusion (4) ###

The character can hamper the thoughts of those he comes into physical 
contact with, at will. He gains the confuse skill at +1 per rank (it is a
Perception skill, described only here), which he can increase as normal.

As a multi-action with a brawling attack, he may also perform a
confusion attack versus his target's willpower or Knowledge. (This is not
an action for the target.) If his total is higher (not equal to), the target
is confused. Characters may not play cards (if the gamemaster is using
game-enhancing cards with the adventures) or spend points, and they
receive a +5 difficulty modiﬁer to even simple actions for a number of
rounds equal to two times the rank of this Special Ability.


### Darkness (3) ###

The character can project a ﬁeld of darkness around himself, adding
+5 per rank to the difficulty of any sight-based skill totals. The ﬁeld
extends in a half-sphere around the character with a radius equal to
one meter per rank. The ﬁeld can be maintained for a maximum of
one minute per rank before dispersing.


### Elasticity (1) ###

The character can stretch, elongate, and compress his body, allowing
him to expand his height or become so narrow he can pass through
keyholes, cracks, or any other opening he could normally see through.
It takes one round or more to slip through small openings, depending
on their depth. The character gains +1 per rank to acrobatics, dodge,
or sleight of hand totals, in addition to con totals when using that skill
to disguise his own appearance.


### Endurance (1) ###

The character has great endurance, and gains a +3D per rank to
Strength or stamina checks when performing taxing physical tasks
(such as holding one's breath underwater for a long period or running
a long distance).


### Enhanced Sense (3) ###

One of the character's ﬁve senses is heightened to abnormal levels.
The bonus to the skill total received depends on the sense: sight is +1;
hearing is +2; touch, taste, or smell are +3. The bonus is per rank and
applies to all skills related to the sense. To have multiple enhanced senses,
this Special Ability must be taken at least once for each sense.


### Environmental Resistance (1) ###

The character is resistant to extremes of heat, cold, and pressure and
gains a +3D per rank to Strength or stamina checks to resist ill effects
from these environmental conditions. The character is not resistant to
heat or cold attacks, as these come and go too quickly for the Special
Ability to provide protection.


### Flight (6) ###

The character can ﬂy, either by nature or by virtue of having wings.
The character's ﬂying rate equals his base Move times 2 times the number
of ranks. The ﬂying/0-G skill is required to maneuver.


### Extra Body Part (0) ###

The character has an extra limb or organ. If external, these
may be secondary arms or legs, a tail, or some more exotic bodily
addition, such as ﬁns, tentacles, or antennae. If internal, the parts are
organs such as extra eyes, hearts, or mysterious glands. Unless
specified by a Disadvantage or Limitation, the extra parts
are included in the hero's body tastefully. Additionally, except in
cases where the character has an Enhancement or another Special
Ability that uses this one (for example, Extra Body Part: Tail
and Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon: Tail), the extra part is
nonfunctional. A character may have only one rank in this Special
Ability, but she may have multiple versions to represent multiple
additional organs or limbs.


### Extra Sense (1) ###

The character can detect something that a normal Human cannot, 
such as changes in pressure, seismic activity, radiation ﬂuctuations, 
and so on. She gains a +1D to her search rolls in attempting to detect 
the speciﬁc energy or environmental change and +1D to her investigation 
rolls in ﬁguring out source or other relevant information. The gamemaster 
may also allow a +1 skill total bonus to other activities that would beneﬁt 
from whatever the extra sense can detect. All modiﬁers are per rank in 
this Special Ability.


### Fast Reactions (3) ###

The character gains +1D per rank to his Perception when determining 
initiative, and, for up to three times during the adventure, he may
receive one additional action for one round.


### Fear (2) ###

The character can provoke fear in those who can see or hear him.
He gains a +1 per rank to all intimidation totals and combat defense
difficulties against those so affected. The willpower or Knowledge 
difﬁculty to resist a Fear attack is 15.


### Glider Wings (3) ###

The character can ﬂy by drifting with air currents, provided there is
sufficient wind. The gamemaster decides how much wind there is available 
and how fast it moves the glider. Characters with this Special Ability 
need the ﬂying/0-G skill to control their passage. A character may not 
have this ability more than once.


### Hardiness (1) ###

The character can take damage better than normal. She add 1 per rank to 
her damage resistance total against any type of damage.


### Hypermovement (1) ###

The character is extremely fast, adding +2 meters per round per rank to 
her base Move rate, which in turn affects all other types of movement.


### Immortality (7) ###

The character is immortal, though she will grow older, at a decreased pace
compared to the rest of her species. If she is reduced to zero Body 
Points, she doesn't die. She will not go unconscious or bleed to death 
(as mortally wounded characters do), but she will not heal without 
psionic or similar special aid or the Accelerated Healing Special 
Ability -- her arms could be blown off, her abdomen eviscerated, or 
whatever. She may perform only the most minimal of physical
actions, such as squirming, and some actions may be impossible. She
may rely on her Agility for initiative purposes only.

There should be one particular set of circumstances whereby the
character will die forever. These sets of circumstances should not
be too unusual -- killed directly by an Extranormal blast, drowning
decapitation, and so on are all good examples.

A character may not have this ability more than once.


### Immunity (1) ###

The character is highly resistant to disease and poisons and receives a
+1D per rank to Strength or stamina checks when determining whether
he has contracted an illness or suffering from ingested poisons.


### Increased Attribute (2) ###

Some extraordinary training or physiological trait allows the character 
to gain +1 bonus per rank to all rolled totals related to that attribute.
(For Strength, this also includes the damage resistance total and Strength
Damage.) A character may have multiple ranks of this Special Ability, as well
as multiple versions of it.

Note: To get another rank in this Special Ability after character creation
costs 4 times the number in front of the "D" of the attribute that it affects
plus the number of ranks currently in the Special Ability. (This is instead
of the normal cost to increase Special Abilities.)


### Infravision/ Ultravision (1) ###
The character gains the ability to see in the dark using either 
infravision or ultravision. Infravision allows the character to see 
changes in heat, while ultravision enables the character to make the
most of the available light. Each provides a +2 per rank in a single 
version of this Special Ability to sight-based rolls while in dim or 
dark conditions. Obviously, extreme heat or bright light (including
daylight) prevent this Special Ability from working.



### Intangibility (5) ###

The character can reduce his physical density to virtually zero for one
minute per rank. During that time, his damage resistance score against
physical and energy attacks is +3D per rank, but his movement rate is
halved. An intangible character can pass through solid objects, providing
they do not contain wards or other spells of protection designed to repel
passage of this nature. He may not pass through energy or electriﬁed
barriers. While intangible, the character cannot carry any object along
(including clothing), nor can he attempt any physical attack. It takes a
full round for a character to become intangible or solid, during which
he can do nothing else. The character must spend at least one minute
solid before attempting intangibility again.


### Invisibility (3) ###

The character can become transparent. This adds 1 per rank to the
character's dodge, sneak, and hide totals, as well as +1 per rank to all
default search, investigation, and attack difficulties against the character
that the invisible character is not actively trying to defeat. Additionally,
no character may take an action to"spot" the character unless the gamemaster 
feels there is sufficient provocation, such as brushing against
others or removing something in a crowded area.

The invisibility covers the character's basic clothes only -- not
any gear she's carrying, or anything she picks up. Also, remember that
the character is transparent when invisible -- she can't hide things
behind her back.


### Iron Will (2) ###
The character is highly resistant to all interaction attempts and
mental attacks. The character gains a +1D per rank to all willpower rolls
and +2 to the standard difficulty of any such attempts against this
character.


### Life Drain (5) ###

This ability allows the character to drain attribute pips, Body Points,
or Wounds from his target.

The character must choose one set of attributes to target,
either physical (Agility, Mechanical, Strength), mental (Knowledge, 
Perception, Technical), Wounds, or Body Points. For example, most 
vampires drink blood, and thus lower Body Points, while succubi target 
the soul and so weaken mental attributes. The player must specify in 
what manner the character drains these attributes (biting the neck, 
hypnosis, or another means). It should involve some sort of successful 
attack result (either physical or mental).

When the character wishes to employ Life Drain, he makes an
attack on his target using the relevant skill. For every four points over
the target's defense roll, the character drains one pip per rank off each
of the target's relevant attributes or three points per rank from the
character's Body Points or one Wound for every two ranks. (Remember
that there are three pips in each die.)

If any of the target's attributes or Body Points ever go to zero (or
the character reaches the Dead Wound level), the target goes into a
coma. She may try once per day to wake up by making a successful
Moderate stamina or Strength roll. She regains one attribute point (to
each attribute affected) every hour after the attack. Body Points and
Wound levels return at the normal rate.

For each attribute pip the character drains, he may add one pip to
any attribute in his chosen category. He would get one Body Point for
each Body Point drained or one Wound for each Wound drained.
Life-Drained attributes and unused Body Points or Wounds disappear at a 
rate of one pip or point per hour.

A character may have multiple ranks of this Special Ability, as well
as multiple versions of it.


### Longevity (3) ###

The character lives longer than the average Human. Often, this
Special Ability has a Flaw attached that governs what the character
must do to maintain his life. The character should gain peripheral
bonuses during game play because of his "longer outlook." A character
may not have this ability more than once.


### Luck, Good (2) ###

The character is blessed with unusually good luck. Once per adventure, 
a character with Good Luck can receive one of the following beneﬁts
just by asking for it: action, breakthrough, haste, or second chance. See
the "Luck Beneﬁts" sidebar for details on each of these options. Calling
upon one's luck does not count as an action.

Good Luck can only be declared once per rank during a particular
adventure, but it may be declared at any time, and it cannot be 
cancelled by any other effect. A character may have up to two ranks of
this Special Ability.


### Luck, Great (3) ###

A character with Great Luck can call on one of the following beneﬁts 
once per adventure per rank: action, alertness, breakthrough, haste,
hero, opponent fails, or second chance. See the "Luck Beneﬁts" sidebar
for details on each of these options. Calling upon one's luck does not
count as an action.

If the character has not used his Great Luck during an adventure
and something really disastrous happens, the gamemaster may choose to
counteract the effects and temporarily "burn out" the character's Special
Ability -- that is, the character's Great Luck has been used up for the
adventure. Usually, this is used when the character does something stupid
or the player is the victim of incredibly bad luck -- die rolling, not the
Disadvantage -- and something "stops" the effect. This is a "last ditch,"
gamemaster-controlled effort when circumstances get out of control. It
is also a nice thing for inexperienced roleplayers to have -- just in case
they do something they really shouldn't have, they get another chance.

Example: *The character's mission is to turn off the power at a
nuclear plant or it will explode and destroy the city that's conveniently
downwind. Unfortunately, the character takes too long ﬁghting the
minions of the bad guy who set the plant to overload, and, according
to the rules, the whole city should go up in a radioactive ﬁreball. The
character is too late. The gamemaster might choose to have the character
be really lucky -- the villain was bluffing, and there's really more time
on the clock than anyone thought, or the power plant begins a long
meltdown procedure instead of exploding. In any case, the character's
Good Luck is gone for this adventure (his luck ran out), but he has a
chance of averting disaster.*

As with Good Luck, the character may have up to two ranks of
this Special Ability.

### Luck Beneﬁts ###

* action: Add 2 to all of the character's skill or attribute totals for 
the round.

* alertness: When the character calls upon this beneﬁt, he gains a special 
"sixth sense" outside of all other rules and roleplaying situations
that will help him to spot a previously unseen item, character, or clue 
selected by the gamemaster. The beneﬁt does not confer omniscience,
however -- and the gamemaster can select her own time for having it come 
into effect. It is normally used to allow a character to spot
something he missed in a previous search, something that is important 
to the adventure.

* breakthrough: Add 1D to any one skill die code in which the character 
has no additional pips or dice (in other words, a skill in which
the character is untrained). The beneﬁt also eliminates the unskilled 
modiﬁer for using that skill.

* haste: Gain one additional action for one round.

* hero: Receive one bonus Fate Point, which must be used on an action 
immediately after requesting it.

* opponent fails: After an opponent or enemy has completed an action 
against the character, this beneﬁt may be called upon to cancel
the effects entirely. The opponent's action is then wasted, and play 
continues. This beneﬁt may not be used to cancel an action that is not 
directed at least partially at the lucky character.

* second chance: Using this beneﬁt allows the character to attempt any 
action she has just tried again, from the very beginning. Relying
on this beneﬁt, however, may not be used to negate "bad choices" -- 
the action performed must be performed again -- nor does it allow
the character to "get back" Fate Points, Character Points, or cards 
(if used) spent on the original action. The character merely gets 
another chance, immediately following the ﬁrst attempt, to perform 
the action again. All effects from the ﬁrst attempt are negated.


### Luck Notes ###

A character may have up to two ranks each in Good Luck and Great Luck. 
This Special Ability can be taken with the Bad Luck Disadvantage -- 
sometimes really good things happen, sometimes really bad things happen.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


### Master of Disguise (3) ###

The character has a natural talent for disguise. She gains a +5 per
rank bonus to con totals when using that skill to disguise herself and
a +1D bonus per rank to any con, intimidation, or persuasion actions
while in that disguise.


### Multiple Abilities (1) ###

The character has multiple minor abilities that improve a few different 
tasks. All bonuses are added to the skill or attribute total, not
to the die code. The bonuses should be fairly limited in their 
applications, pertaining to speciﬁc uses of particular skills (like 
specializations do), but there can be several of them for each selection 
of this Special Ability. The maximum total bonus for each rank is +4.


Example: *A character could have"eyestalks" that give him a +1 bonus
to Perception or search totals that would negate surprise, the ability to
focus his ears on particular types of noises (+1 bonus when listening for
particular sounds), and ﬁngers that are sensitive to subdermal motion
(+1 bonus to sleight of hand against safes with moving tumblers).*


### Natural Armor (3) ###

The character has plates, toughened skin, scales, or something
similar. His own surface adds 1D per rank to his damage resistance
total to physical (not mental) attacks and contact poisons, corrosives,
or similar materials.


### Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon (2) ###

The character has some sort of natural weapon -- such as claws,
pincers, bone spikes, or stinger -- that add 1D per rank to his Strength
Damage when determining his damage with the natural weapon. The
character uses brawling to attack, unless he can detach the weapon from
himself or (in the case of a super-scientiﬁc weapon) its exists separately.
In these latter cases, the character employs melee combat to wield it.


### Natural Ranged Weapon (3) ###

The character has some sort of natural ranged weapon, using missile 
weapons (for solid objects) or ﬁrearms (for energy, gas, or chemical 
projection or for solid projectiles in cybernetics or super-science
weapons) to target it. Long range equals 20 times the number of ranks
in this Special Ability times the character's Strength, lift, or ﬁrearms 
(as appropriate) in meters. The damage for physically enhanced projections 
is the character's Strength Damage plus 1D per rank, while the
damage for all other types of blasts is 3D per rank. The projection
must have a visible effect (such as bone shards or a glowing ray) and
it may not do mental damage. Note that, regardless of the nature of
the projection, there are no additional effects from this type of Special
Ability unless an Enhancement allows otherwise.


### Omnivorous (2) ###

The character can gain nourishment from any organic substance
(though she is not immune to poisons). She can also chew through
just about any organic substance with no adverse effects to her teeth
or jaws. A character may not have this ability more than once.


### Paralyzing Touch (4) ###

The character can freeze her target with the merest touch.
When she makes a brawling attack, she may, instead of doing damage, 
paralyze her victim, who remains that way until he makes a successful 
Knowledge or willpower roll against the brawling skill total. He
may attempt to do so once per round; the only other actions he may
take are mental-based ones and Extranormal (such as Metaphysics) or
Special Ability ones that do not require movement.

Note: Characters who are heavily armored or covered will be harder
to hit. The gamemaster needs to decide how much skin is exposed and
adjust the attack difficulty accordingly.

A character may not have this ability more than once.


### Possession, Limited (8) ###

The character can possess the body of a living creature or a corpse.
The character must be within three times the rank of this Special
Ability in meters of the target in order to take possession.
Possessing a corpse doesn't require a roll, but it does take an action.

Possessing a living being involves making a Knowledge or willpower
check by the possessor versus a standard interaction difficulty (see the
"Mental Defenses" sidebar on page 85 for details). Exceeding (but not
equalling) the difficulty means the target has been possessed. The target
can actively defend if she is aware of the potential danger.

To gather knowledge about his host body's life, the possessing
character must generate a successful investigation total against the
target's Knowledge roll (this does not count as an action for the target).
Information the possessor gains depends upon the level of success
achieved; see the accompanying chart for details.

With Limited Possession, the character does not gain control of
the new form. Instead, he must use persuasion, intimidation, or other
interaction skills to convince his host to do what he wishes.

Exiting a host body is commonly a simple action. As long as the
possessing character exits before the host dies, he simply moves on to
his own or another form. Killing a possessing spirit usually involves
taking it completely by surprise with a killing blow to the host form or
using a spell to force it to remain in the body until it can be slain.


### Possession, Full (10) ###

The character can possess the body of a living creature or a corpse.
This works in the same way as Limited Possession, save that the
possessing character gains her new form's physical attributes (Agility, 
Mechanical, Strength), retains her own Extranormal and mental
attributes (Knowledge, Perception, and Technical), and gains complete
control over the new form.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Possession Knowledge Chart ###

Result points equal the difference between the investigation
total and the target's Knowledge roll.

*Result Points Needed: Knowledge Attained*

* *0:* Basic information -- target's name, age, base of operations
* *1 to 4:* More personal information -- target's job, ﬁnancial status, 
  any current schedule
* *5 to 8:* More in-depth personal information -- identities and 
  backgrounds of family, friends, lovers
* *9 to 12:* Very personal information -- secrets, private
  likes and dislikes, and so on 
* *13:* Everything there is to know

### Quick Study (3) ###

The character has an uncanny ability to learn new skills and improve
old ones, limited to one attribute. He always learns new skills as if he
had a teacher (even if he doesn't), and he can improve skills he already
knows at a cost of one Character Point less than normal. This Special
Ability applies to specializations as well as combines very well with
the Age Disadvantage, if the character is young -- he is a prodigy, and
that's why he's learned his starting skills so quickly. This Special Ability
can be taken once for each attribute.


### Sense of Direction (2) ###
The character has a good sense of direction. He gains +1D per
rank to navigation and search rolls.


### Shapeshifting (3) ###

The character can manipulate the shape, color, and overall appearance 
of her body, though mass and body compositions remain the same.
The character must chose a speciﬁc creature to emulate, gaining one
form for every three additional points spent on this Special Ability.
At six ranks in this ability, the gamemaster may allow shifting among
one class of creatures (such as birds or furniture) as long as all forms
chosen for previous ranks were within the same class.

Body Points, Wounds, and the Knowledge attribute remain unaffected by 
this Special Ability, but the dice in the Agility, Mechanical,
Strength, Perception, and Technical are redistributed to match the new
form. The minimum Mechanical and Technical for non-humanoid
forms is 1D, because the shapeshifter retains some memory of these
attributes. Additional dice in skills above the base attribute score
remain the same, though the total dice in each skill changes to reﬂect
the adjustments in the base attribute. Likewise, not all skills will be
usable in the new form.

Attribute dice can also be used to include Special Abilities in the
new form. One attribute die can be spent to gain one rank in one Special
Ability or to get a +2 skill total bonus (split among up to two skills).
The gamemaster may allow a larger skill total bonus or more skills to
fall under the bonus if the desired effect is particularly narrow (such
as a bonus for a single sense).

For an example of how Shapeshifting can work, see the accompanying sidebar.

Shapeshifting may be done at will, though a Limitation may force
it to be triggered by stress or environmental factors.

If shifting voluntarily, the character must generate a willpower total
of 11 to bring about the change, and a second total to turn back again.
Each change takes one full round in which the character may do nothing 
else. Failure at the check means the transformation does not occur,
and the character cannot try again for at least an hour.

It is highly recommended that the hero comes up with some typical
forms and their game characteristics before beginning play. The new
form need not exactly resemble a "typical" version of the emulated
creature or object.

### Shapeshifting Example: ###

Mark is playing a wereleopard. He chooses Shapeshifting,
specifying that he will only change from Human to leopard
and back again. The gamemaster decides he'll gain one rank
of the Hypermovement Special Ability (+2 to the movement
rate) and +2 to all search totals that require smell when in
his wereleopard form.

Mark's character has 18 attribute dice arranged thusly:

* AGILITY 2D+2
* STRENGTH 3D
* KNOWLEDGE 2D+2
* PERCEPTION 2D+2
* MECHANICAL 3D+1
* TECHNICAL 3D+2

When he changes into wereleopard form, Mark's character has the 
following attribute values, the total of which has been lowered 
by 2D because of the bonuses:

* AGILITY 4D
* STRENGTH 3D+2
* KNOWLEDGE 2D+2
* PERCEPTION 3D+2
* MECHANICAL 1D
* TECHNICAL 1D

### Silence (3) ###

The character can move in complete silence. He gains +2D per rank
to all sneak checks and a +1D per rank when attacking from behind.


### Skill Bonus (1) ###

Skill Bonus represents a natural talent (a character with the 
Charismatic group might be "friendly and outgoing"), a particular 
knack (a character with the Ranged Combat group has a "keen eye"), 
years of devotion to a profession prior to beginning adventure, or 
the result of an extended life.

The character chooses a group of three related skills in which he
gains +1 to the skill total of any action performed with those skills
(or specializations of that skill). The skills need not be under the same
attribute. The character may or may not actually have adds in those
skills, and the gamemaster must approve the fact that they are "related."
Some examples of skill groups include:

* Acting: bargain, con, persuasion
* Acute Balance: acrobatics, climb/jump, sneak
* Athletics: lift, running, throwing
* Charismatic: command, con, persuasion
* Close Combat: brawling, melee combat, dodge
* Investigative: investigation, search, streetwise
* Leadership: command, intimidation, persuasion
* Photographic Memory: languages, scholar, investigation
* Observant: gambling, investigation, search
* Ranged Combat: ﬁrearms, missile weapons, throwing
* Players may substitute other related skills for the ones listed in the
* groups above, or create their own groups as long as there is a common
* thread and the gamemaster approves the grouping.

Three specializations may replace one general skill, getting a +1 for
three different specializations.

Example: *In the Close Combat group, a character might replace
melee combat with three specializations -- melee combat: knives, melee
combat: swords, and melee combat: clubs. While this means the character
gains no bonus for "general" melee combat activities (such as using an
improvised weapon), he does have a more"detailed" group. This may be
done for up to all three skills in the group, choosing six specializations
instead of two skills or nine specializations instead of three skills.*

Additionally, the character acts as if trained in these skills even if
he doesn't have any additional pips in them, and so does not get the
unskilled modiﬁer. This Special Ability does not affect the cost of
improving the related skills.

Gamemasters may allow a higher bonus for fewer skills (such as
a set of two skills where one gets a +1 bonus and the other gets a +2
bonus, or a +3 bonus to a set of three specializations). However, the
bonus per rank may total no more than +3.

At each additional rank, the player may increase the bonus by +1
for three of the skills affected by this Special Ability. A character may
have different versions of this ability for different groups of skills,
though the skills in each group may not overlap.


### Skill Minimum (4) ###

The character can select three related skills unaffected by any other
sort of Special Ability and the character will always gain a minimum
total of 3 times the number before the "D," even if she rolls a Critical
Failure.

Example: *If the player selects persuasion, con, and intimidation (all
interaction skills) for her character, all of which she has at 4D, and she
generates a less than 12, the total automatically becomes 12. That is the
character's minimum total.*

The player may not select Skill Minimum for any skill that has any other
Advantage or Special Ability tied to it. Also, the skills must be 
related in some way (see the Skill Bonus Special Ability for information 
on related skills). The character may only select general skills,
but the specializations underneath that general skill are affected as 
well. This Special Ability may be selected only once for each group of 
skills.


### Teleportation (3) ###

The character can move instantly to another place up to 10 meters per
rank away. The character must see her destination clearly. In combat, 
this action takes an entire round. The character may take along 
whatever she can carry.


### Transmutation (5) ###
The character can alter his substance to something else, while
retaining his form (such as a man who turns to stone). Characters with
this ability may only shift into one speciﬁc substance, which the player
must specify when his character gets the Special Ability. Generally, this
substance gives the character distinct advantages. The player may select
up to 4 points (not ranks) in other Special Abilities that relate to the
chosen form, per rank in this Special Ability. (Thus, two Transmutation 
ranks means 8 points in other Special Abilities.) Natural Armor,
Hardiness, and Environmental Resistance are common ones.


### Uncanny Aptitude (3) ###

This Special Ability is similar to the Skill Bonus Special Ability
in that some sort of bizarre ability gives the character added bonuses
to certain actions. However, instead of selecting a group of skills that
the character gains a bonus to, the player and the gamemaster work
out circumstances where these abilities come into play. For instance,
a character might gain a +1 bonus to all Agility-related skill totals
when in sunlight.

A character may have several variations of this ability, reﬂecting
different bonuses. Each variation could have several ranks, with the
bonuses adding to each other.


### Ventriloquism (3) ###

The character can throw her voice up to three meters away per rank.
No skill roll is required to do this, but if it is part of a trick attempt,
she receives a +2D bonus per rank to con and persuasion rolls.


### Water Breathing (2) ###

The character can breathe water and will not drown under water. She
gains +1D per rank to all swim rolls because she doesn't need to worry
about drowning.


### Youthful Appearance (1) ###

The character looks much younger than she actually is and receives 
a +1D per rank to persuasion or con. In general, characters should
not look more than 10 to 20 years younger than they are, regardless of
the number of ranks, though gamemaster discretion and common sense
should rule here.


Special Ability Enhancements
----------------------------

Enhancements allow Special Abilities to be somehow more than
the typical version. Each Enhancement may be taken more than once 
for each Special Ability, either altering the ability in similar 
though distinct ways or, for some, through stacking the effects. The 
cost of the Enhancement adds to the associated Special Ability's total 
cost (base cost plus the cost for additional ranks). 

* Additional Effect (1): The Special Ability produces a useful, though
minor, side effect that is a natural extension of the power. The more
useful the side effect, the greater the number of ranks. Some examples
include a skill bonus when using the ability, doing residual damage (such
as reﬂection with Natural Armor or radiation with Natural Ranged
Weapon), or adding functionality to an Extra Body Part.

* Bestow (varies): The character may share her Special Ability with
a certain type of target: sentient living, nonsentient living, or 
nonliving. The player must chose which group when including this 
Enhancement. The cost of this Enhancement equals one-half (rounded up)
of the Special Ability total (base cost plus additional ranks cost plus
Enhancement costs). She may use her Special Ability on herself and on
members of her target group with a multi-action penalty. The character
may give her Special Ability to one person per action.
Some Special Abilities will require better stories concerning how
the character can manage sharing them than others (such as Youthful 
Appearance or Ambidextrous), while others may not have this
Enhancement (such as Longevity or Immortality). The target has
control over the use of the Bestowed Special Ability for as long as the
Bestowing character allows. A character may only have one rank in this
Enhancement, but she may have multiple versions of it.

* Extended Range (3): The factor used to determine the range of the
character's Special Ability is increased. Every rank of this Enhancement
allows the player to add one half of the ranks in the Special Ability
(rounded up) to the factor when determining the range. Thus, to increase
the range factor by half the ranks costs three, by the ranks in the ability
costs six, by 1.5 times the ranks costs eight, and so on.

    *Example: *The range for Natural Ranged Weapon is 20 times the
    number of ranks in the Special Ability times the character's Strength
    or lift in meters. With two ranks of Extended range, the range would
    now be 20 times twice the number of ranks in the Special Ability times
    the character's Strength or lift.

* Multiple Targets (2): The character may use the Special Ability
more than once per round without incurring a multi-action penalty. For
each rank in this Enhancement, the character gains one additional use
of the Special Ability. This adds to any other bonus actions provided
by a power; it does not multiply it.


Special Ability Limitations
---------------------------

These Limitations can be associated with Special Abilities, restricting 
their functionality and reducing their total cost (base cost plus the
cost for additional ranks plus any Enhancements -- not the per rank
cost). For example, the total cost of two ranks of Iron Will in a game
where Special Abilities are uncommon is four, and in a game where
they are common, the cost is three.

Limitations may not lower a Special Ability's total cost below one,
and all Limitations must have some sort of effect on play -- just like
Disadvantages. Each of a character's Special Abilities may have more
than one of each Limitation, as they can either describe similar but
distinct negative situations or, in some cases, stack the effects.

* Ability Loss (3 for 1 rank; 4 for 2 ranks): The character temporarily 
loses his Special Ability at regular intervals or, when the Special
Ability is used, he loses the ability to use a common skill in which he
has experience (that is, additional pips or dice). Examples include: a
character who cannot shapeshift when the sun is out; a character who
cannot use his natural weapons on a particular day of the month or
during a certain phase of the moon. The character is aware of what
the circumstances are that will cause this. For an additional point
and additional rank, the character must undergo some sort of (fairly
simple) procedure to regain his ability or skill use. A Special Ability
may have up to two ranks in a single variation of this Limitation, but
a character may have it multiple times for different Special Abilities,
circumstances, or combinations of Special Abilities and skills.

* Allergy (3 for 1 rank; 4 for 2 ranks): The character has a somewhat
minor allergy. Exposure to a fairly common substance (smoke, sunlight,
particular food, etc.) causes the character to lose all Critical Success
rerolls until the condition is removed. For an additional point and
additional rank, the effects are worse, and the character loses all actions
due to coughing ﬁts, watering eyes, or similar discomfort until she can
get away from the allergen. A Special Ability may only have one rank
in this Limitation, though it may have several different Allergies.

* Burn-out (1): See the Disadvantage by this name for suggestions
that could also be applied to a Special Ability. The more likely the
Burn-out, the greater the number of ranks in this Limitation. A Special
Ability may have multiple variations of this Limitation, representing
different triggers for the Burn-out.

* Cybernetics (0): An artiﬁcial limb or organ provides the character's
Special Ability. As a cybernetic improvement is impossible to accidently
drop or remove, this Limitation has no cost. Characters may have only
one rank in it.

### Cybernetics and Special Abilities ###

Mechanical implants exist as the most common means for an unmutated 
Human (and possibly some other species of the gamemaster's devising) 
to gain Special Abilities. Read the "Cybernetics" chapter for details 
on how to include Special Abilities in your character by replacing an 
organic part with a mechanical construct.

* Debt (3): Someone (or, more likely, some entity) gave the character
the Special Ability, along with certain obligations and restrictions. The
character must continually beg the giver to retain the Special Ability,
or she must perform certain tasks at the giver's request in exchange for
continued use of the Special Ability. A Special Ability may only have
one rank in this Limitation.

*Flaw (1): All difficulties associated with using the Special Ability 
are increased by +2 per rank. The greater the rank associated with this 
Flaw, the greater the difficulty modiﬁer.

* Minor Stigma (3): The character cannot use the Special Ability without
performing the "proper rituals" before or after (someone with a natural 
weapon who must sketch an image of his intended victim before hunting 
him down; a shapeshifter who must be puriﬁed by his cult after killing 
someone). A Special Ability may only have one rank in this Limitation.

* Others Only (2 for 1 rank; 3 for 2 ranks; 4 for 3 ranks): The 
character may not use the Special Ability himself; he may only allow 
others to use it. The value of this Limitation depends on how many
groups of "others" he can use it on: For two points and one rank, the 
character may affect sentient living, nonsentient living, and nonliving 
targets. For three points and two ranks, the character can affect only
two of the three groups. For four points and three ranks, the character 
can affect only one of the three groups. 

    * This Limitation may not be taken more than once per Special Ability.
    Additionally, like the Bestow Enhancement, some Special Abilities may
    require valid reasons before the gamemaster allows the Limitation's
    inclusion. Some abilities, such as Immortality and Longevity, may
    not have this Limitation. The target who gets the Special Ability has
    control over its use as if she actually had the ability, for as long 
    as the giving character allows.

    * Allowing another person access to the Special Ability counts as an
    action for its owner, while using the newfound Special Ability counts
    as as an action for the one who gets it (though gaining access to it does
    not). The Special Ability's owner may only give the Special Ability to
    one character per round, but the target may be different each round.

* Price (1): The character must fulﬁll certain obligations in order to
use the Special Ability. Perhaps when using Water Breathing, the character 
must remain in the water for at least 24 hours for every 24 hours
out of it or suffer -4 modiﬁer per rank in this Limitation to his damage
resistance total for changing environments so quickly. Alternatively,
there could be a Character or Fate Point fee of three Character Points
per rank or one Fate Point per rank in the Limitation per adventure
in which the character uses the Special Ability.

* Restricted (1): The Special Ability is hindered in a way not covered by 
any other Limitation. The more restrictive the situation, the greater 
the number of ranks in this Limitation. For instance, a Natural Weapon 
(either kind) may only be useful against certain items. A Special 
Ability may have multiple variations of this Limitation, each 
representing a different restraint.

* Side Effect (2): One of the character's Special Abilities has
some sort of annoying side effect that appears with its use, such as
constant whistling, a continuous glow, or a terrible stench. Add 4
per rank to the difficulty of all sneak attempts when the Special
Ability is in use, as everyone can ﬁgure out she's coming. This will
also affect interaction attempts, adding at least a +1 per rank to
the difficulty.

* Singularity (1 per Special Ability): The character may use only one 
of a group of two or more Special Abilities each round. It does not 
take an action to switch Special Abilities. He may change the Special 
Ability in use at the beginning of his turn in a round, and he may rely 
on the chosen Special Ability until the next time he changes it. For a 
second rank (and one additional point per Special Ability), it does take 
an action to switch Special Abilities. A Special Ability may not have 
more than two ranks in this Limitation and all Special Abilities in the 
same group must have this Limitation at the same rank. Not all of a 
character's Special Abilities need be in the same Singularity group.

* Super-science (2): The Special Ability is contained in a piece of
equipment -- such as a gun, a staff, or a ring -- developed through a
technological means not readily available and certainly experimental.
The item could be lent to another character or taken away with a
successful grab and used by someone else, though at a +5 to the difﬁculty. 
On a Critical Failure, the item malfunctions and requires repair.
Unless combined with the Burn-out Limitation, a destroyed item may
be recreated in a number of days equal to the total cost of the Special
Ability (including all ranks, Enhancements, and Limitations). Characters 
who wish to have Special Abilities in their cybernetic implants
may not take this Limitation, as cybernetic implants are impossible
to remove without serious and extended effort. (See the Cybernetics
Limitation, described herein.)


Aliens and Human Offshoots
==========================

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

Although it's possible to run a science-ﬁction adventure without
aliens, it's not the norm. This chapter offers you suggestions on how
to design believable aliens. You can use the same ideas to create 
offshoots of Humanity, those mutated by colonization circumstances to
be something not quite like their progenitors.


Designing Aliens and Human Offshoots
------------------------------------

When it comes to game characteristics, aliens and Human offshoots
are made the same way as a standard Human character. If the character
options list doesn't give you any ideas, start either with the "Physical
Appearance" or the "Society" sections. By the time you're done answering 
the questions in those, you'll have a better idea of how to form the
package for a typical member of the species.


Physical Appearance
-------------------

Jot down a few words or sentences for each of these categories. The
more detailed you can be, the more vividly you can describe a member of
the species to others. Additionally, having an idea of physical appearance
can help you decide on the society. If you already have ﬁgured out the
society, then that information can help you decide on an appearance
appropriate for that type of people.

Height range: You can either give a speciﬁc range in meters or be
more vague (tall, short, medium, microscopic).

Build and weight range: Build provides an accessible notion of a
typical member's physique rather than merely giving a weight range.
Most members of a species could be stocky, bulky, lumpy, skinny, well
proportioned, or any of a number of descriptive words.

Heads: The head is typically considered the part of the body where the
most number of sensory organs and the brain are located. Some species
might have their sensory organs split among a few locations, with the
brain in another part, giving them the illusion of having no head.

Sensory organs: Beings rely on sensory organs to gather information 
about their environment. How many does the alien have, and what
do they sense? How well is each sense developed? Humans have ﬁve
senses, but your alien species may have additional, specialized organs to
detect other aspects of their environment, such as barometric pressure
changes or seismic activity. You also need to decide where the sensory
organs are located.

Mouth: Consider the number of mouths, location of them, their
size and shape, type of tongue, and teeth (if any). This often dictates
the alien's dietary needs and rituals. A mouth might even be separate
from the part used to create sounds.

Facial features: On Humans, this includes eyes, ears, nose, and
mouth. Alien species may have these located elsewhere. Decide what
features are on your alien's face, and then specify number, location, size,
shape, color, and other aspects of each.

Respiration: What does the species breathe, and how do they
breathe it? Decide on the respiratory organ, which could be the same
one used to eat (like a Human's mouth), gills, or an organ designed
solely for the purpose of respiration.
Skeletal structure: Decide whether aliens carry their soft ﬂesh over a
skeleton, under a skeleton, neither, or they've managed a little of both.

Movement: How does the alien get around? How many limbs does
the alien require for locomotion? This is often dictated by where the
species typically lives. In heavy-gravity environments, creatures tend to
be closer to the ground, while water-dwellers develop ﬁns and webbing
to help them move through their environment.

Limbs: Consider type, number, length, and what purpose they
have. Some aliens might have developed a separate limb or tentacle
for eating, holding, and ﬁghting.

Manipulators: Determine how the species manipulates objects. If
the species has hands, how many ﬁngers? They could also use pincers,
tentacles, or telekinesis.

Tail: Some species have a tail for balance. If that's the case, how
long is a typical one? Is it tipped with any natural weaponry? Can it
be used like an additional arm?

Skin: Is the skin scaly, smooth, slimy, hairy, or something else? What
color is it? Does it have any markings on it? Does it ooze anything?

Body temperature: Some species can regulate their own body temperature, 
as do Humans and birds. The body of others could be more
inﬂuenced by changes in the environment, like reptiles and ﬁsh. Having
some control of body temperature, as well as the preferred temperature,
can inﬂuence the kind of clothes and preferred climactic conditions.

Decorative features: Decorative features include horns, hair, bone
protrusions, cartilage bumps or ridges, skin ﬂaps, frills, feathers, 
and other aspects that may not do more than be attractive to potential 
mates.


Society
-------

Establishing signiﬁcant features of the alien species' society gives
them more depth by placing them in a larger context. This information 
can also help you decide on the physical appearance. Should you
have already decided upon that, take into consideration what features
you've given your alien so you can create a society that makes sense for
that combination of physical characteristics.

* Community and family: How does the species raise children?
Consider whether the groups formed are based on age, sex, life stage,
relation, or something else. Decide how large the groups can get, and
what happens if the group gets "too big." If there isn't much overlap
between groups, describe why.

* Conﬂicts: Does the species have particular rituals that it performs
in order to solve conﬂicts? Do different groups have alternate ways of
resolving conﬂicts? Are there any penalties for not following the rules?

* Government: The kind of governments that develop generally stem
from the types of groups that are formed and how each resolves conﬂicts.
A highly segregated society with many rituals might consider it natural
to follow a military dictatorship, while one with loosely formed groups
and a discussion-based resolution system might have a democracy.

* Social graces: Every society has many customs that each member
takes for granted. Coming up with a few of these -- which could
include traditional means of performing actions, ritual greetings, table
etiquette, or anything else that can be formalized -- gives the society
a distinctive ﬂavor, as well as providing the opportunity for conﬂict
among species who meet for the ﬁrst time.

* Playtime: Playing is a way of learning about one's environment and
other people in one's social group, even if that's not the most obvious
result. Think about what kinds of games are played: intellectual, physical,
or emotional? Are they played as a way of learning how to get along,
or are they another means of showing off power?

* Science, art, and religion: Decide whether the species considers
any of these more or less important than the others. Describe a few
key aspects -- how prevalent the technology is, whether art is limited
to a single group, the number of religions present --that demonstrate
the capabilities of the species in each area.


Examples and Packages
---------------------

These sets of Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities deﬁne
the physical and mental characteristics of stereotypical members of 
common science-ﬁction species, as well as offer an idea of how to represent
your own aliens and alien packages. Realize that, to keep the point total
down, not every characteristics of each kind of alien was represented
through Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities. Instead, the
most signiﬁcant features were chosen. Gamemasters should customize
these basic characters to ﬁt their idea of each species more closely.

Players may overlay the packages on any other character template.
Disadvantages received from these packages do not count toward the
maximum number of Disadvantages set by the gamemaster. Body
Points for typical characters were added to a gamemaster's character
base of 10.

All species listed here are about two meters tall on average, and
have roughly the same weight range as Humans. Player's characters
designed using the packages should follow the normal character creation
guidelines with respect to Fate Points, Character Points, Body Points,
Wounds, languages, and any other feature not listed in the package.

The total creation point cost refers to the number of points from the
creation point pool that the player must spend to include that package
with her character. The total deﬁned limit cost indicates the number of
skill and attribute dice the player must deduct from the total number
of dice she may spend when creating her character.

Cybernetics
===========

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

Cybernetic enhancements are widely available in the average space
opera universe, both from legitimate dealers and from street surgeons.
This section presents basic details on how to customize some of the
more popular varieties, as well as a sampling of typically available
cyberware.


Character Options and Cybernetic Implants
-----------------------------------------

Cybernetic implants can serve as a handy excuse for having certain
Special Abilities and Disadvantages. These represent, in a convenient
fashion, how each piece of equipment works (or doesn't). In fact, when
the player includes a Special Ability in his character's cybernetic unit,
he must also explain how that Special Ability manifests itself, whether
it be through a gun that pops up, a drug that is released into the system,
or a tool that's revealed from a ﬁngertip. Naturally, the gamemaster
has the right to request that the player alter his choice if the addition
is unreasonable (such a high-powered machine gun installed in a toe).
Gamemasters may even reduce the number of upgrade slots available
in each implant to reﬂect a (relatively) lower-tech setting.

There is no additional cost to include a Special Ability in cybernetic
implants, beyond the normal charge for gaining that Special Ability. 
Special Abilities in cybernetic implants can have Enhancements
and Limitations as per the rules in the "Character Options" chapter.
Gamemasters may require Special Abilities such as Skill Bonus to
be restricted to specializations of the boosted skill that reﬂect what a
character could do with just the limb or organ in question.

Likewise, the cybernetic implants can exist as the focus for certain
Disadvantages, including Price, Debt, and Quirk.


Getting Cybernetic Implants At Character Creation
-------------------------------------------------

When designing a character, the player chooses the type of cybernetic 
implants she wants her character have. This should be limited
to one full limb or a few organs, unless the character also has the
Equipment Advantage. (A higher rank in Equipment means more
cybernetic implants.) The player then selects (and pays the cost for)
any Special Abilities and Disadvantages she wants associated with
the cybernetic implants. Certain Advantages are also appropriate for
cybernetic implants, including Fame, Trademark Specialization, or a
high-ranking Contact or any rank of Patron (either of which could
have arranged for the character to gain the cyberware).

The character need not go through the surgery process or pay the
monetary purchase cost.


After Character Creation
------------------------

After character creation, the character needs not only money (and
Character Points) but time for surgery. The character pays the cybernetic 
implant cost with Funds or credits, including the cost of adding
any Special Abilities, and goes through the surgery installation process
(see the next section). Characters may lower the cost and the surgery
difficulty by taking Disadvantages. Instead of getting bonus Character
Points for opting for more restrictions, Disadvantages lower the surgery
and price difficulty each by 3 times the rank in the Disadvantage, with
a minimum difficulty of 10. If using credits, reduce the cost by 10% per
rank, with a minimum cost of 10,000 credits.

The player also needs to pay the Character Point cost of the Special
Ability plus a number of Character Points equal to the base surgery
cost of the implant.


Installation Surgery
--------------------

Fitting the body with cybernetic implants involves surgery and
can be an extremely painful process. A successful medicine skill check
is required to install cybernetic implants in this manner. If the 
cybernetic implant has been "stripped" (taken off of another host) or has
not been customized, skill totals in personal equipment repair also are
required.

The difficulty of the cyber surgery varies according to the system
involved. Surgery difficulty and the damage done to the person as a
result of a successful installation are listed with the equipment 
characteristics at the end of this chapter.

Characters are always unconscious for 30 minutes after undergoing
surgery, and are likely to be injured. This damage is healed at the same
rate as normal wounds. Additionally, Character or Fate Points may
not be spent to improve the cyber-character's natural healing abilities
or the skills of herself or others when trying to recover from wounds
incurred during cyber surgery.

The results of cyber surgery are determined by the level of success
of the medicine check (the difference between the skill total and the
difficulty). Use the following guidelines:

* Failure (skill total did not meet or beat difficulty): The cyber system
is not installed. Worse, the surgeon has botched the job. The patient
takes more damage than he normally would have -- increase the damage
to Incapacitated or 75% of the character's base Body Points.
Minimal (skill total equals difficulty): System is installed, but just
barely. Damage is Severely Wounded or 50% of the character's base Body
Points, and the system malfunctions on a 1 or 2 on the Wild Die.

* Average (skill total beats difficulty by 1-5 points): The system is
installed, but malfunctions on a Critical Failure. The character incurs
normal damage (Severely Wounded or 50% of the character's base
Body Points).

* Good (skill total beats difficulty by 6-9 points): Installation is
successful. The character incurs normal damage (Severely Wounded
or 50% of the character's base Body Points).

* Superior (skill total beats difficulty by 10 or more points): 
Installation is successful and the amount of time needed to recover from
surgery damage is halved. The character incurs normal damage (Severely
Wounded or 50% of the character's base Body Points).

When using stripped cybergear, make two separate skill totals -- one
medicine and one personal equipment repair at the same difficulty. One
failure is enough to botch the surgery entirely. In any other instance,
add together the amounts by which each skill beat the difficulty. Divide
this total by 2, and compare the new number to the levels above to
determine the effect on the character.


Upgrading Existing Cybernetic Implants
--------------------------------------

Once a character has a cybernetic implant installed, he may upgrade
it as long as he has upgrade slots left in the unit. Even then, by 
swapping out one upgrade for another, the character can put something
new in.

To add an upgrade to an empty slot requires a single personal
equipment repair roll at the difficulty. To swap out an existing upgrade
needs a personal equipment repair roll for the removal and one for the
installation. In both instances, the character pays the cost of adding a
Special Ability, but does not pay any additional fee.

In most cases, the gamemaster should rule that improving an
existing upgrade (such as adding an additional rank to a Natural
Weapons Special Ability) demands a swapping-out procedure. A few,
such as adding ranks to low levels of the Skill Bonus Special Ability,
may only call for the installation of a new ﬁrmware, which can be done 
with a computer interface/repair attempt. Whether it's a swapping or 
ﬁrmware procedure, the character only pays for the additional ranks, 
not for the total number of ranks. (Unless, of course, the character 
wants to keep the old upgrade as a spare; then the character would
need to pay for the entire cost.)

Note that if the character wants to go from a small part of a larger
unit to a larger unit (such as a hand to an arm), she must purchase a
whole new implant and go through the procedure as if she were getting
a new part (see the "After Character Creation" part of the "Getting
Cybernetic Implants" section earlier in this chapter). Hopefully, the
shop where she's getting the new parts from will buy her old cybernetic
implants from her.


Determining the Installation Difﬁculty
--------------------------------------

Every type of cybernetic implant has a base surgery difficulty, which
indicates how challenging it is to install a standard, no-frills unit. Of
course, few characters will want to go through the trouble just to have
a fake limb that works exactly the same as the original. Characters
may choose to upgrade their cybernetic implants by taking Special
Abilities, which represent a program or additional piece of equipment
added to unit. To ﬁgure out how difficult it is to install an upgraded
unit, the player determines the creation point cost of the Special
Ability, including any additional ranks and any Enhancements and
Limitations and their ranks. (The player determines the creation point
cost of the Special Ability, regardless of whether it's during or after
character creation.) Then the player subtracts from that number any
Disadvantages she wishes her character to gain by having the cybernetic
implant. Finally, once everything is approved by the gamemaster (that
is, the gamemaster decides whether that model is currently available),
the player adds that number to the base surgery difficulty to ﬁgure out
the installation difficulty of the item.

Use this number regardless of whether the character is getting a
new implant or upgrading an existing one.


Determining the Cost
--------------------

The price difficulty for a new cybernetic implant equals the 
instilation difficulty, modiﬁed as the gamemaster deems necessary based
on the circumstances of the installation. In credits, the cyberware costs
1,000 times the installation difficulty. Again, the gamemaster may alter 
this based on the situation.

For upgrading an existing unit, subtract 10 from the installation 
difficulty to get the upgrade price difficulty. In credits,
the upgrade costs 100 times this price difficulty. Either number may be 
modiﬁed as the gamemaster sees ﬁt.

### Installation Example ###

A gamemaster might have available the Equilibria
cyber-ear. Fitted in place of the inner ear, the Equilibria
improves balance. This is an ear unit with one upgrade,
Skill Bonus: Balance (R3), +3 to brawling: block, melee
combat: parry/block, acrobatics: beam walking, dodge, and
riding totals. The gamemaster decides that a low-grade
Equilibria has the Limitation Allergy: Loud Sounds
(R1), character loses all Critical Success rerolls when
exposed very loud sounds (like hammering). The total
point cost for the Special Ability is 1 (3 for the Special
Ability and its ranks minus 3 for the Limitation, with
a minimum cost of 1). The base surgery difficulty is 17
for an ear. With the upgrade, the installation difficulty
becomes 18. The price difficulty is 18, while the credits
cost is 18,000.

Cyberpsychosis
--------------

Cyberpsychosis is a state of mind some "chipheads" and "cynchware chocks"
achieve after too much cyber-strain has been placed on their nervous systems
and cranial functions."Cyber-psyches" are people who have gone too deep 
into the slicksteel universe and have truly become "one" with their 
cyberware.

Cyberpsychosis is like any other psychosis. The character becomes
caught up in a world detached from reality. Cyberware, chiplife, and
"jacking in and tuning out" have become the most important thing
to this person. Organic flesh (and the needs of that ﬂesh) are only
distractions along the pure slicksteel path. A character with 
cyberpsychosis cannot relate well with the organic world but is 
intimately familiar with the nonorganic. Cyberpsyches seek to replace 
their organicness with the "new-and-improved" cybernetics available to
them. Then, they seek to upgrade themselves by getting more powerful
and better attachments. It is a never-ending cycle, an addiction that
feeds on itself.

Cyberpsychosis can be roleplayed by players' characters and gamemaster 
characters alike (and represented through the Hindrance or Quirk 
Disadvantages). It is recommended that the gamemaster (and the players, 
if a player's character is involved) work out the severity and details 
of this psychosis, so that it can be effectively roleplayed. It should
be a roleplaying choice as well -- it is very hard to play a psychosis
effectively or realistically, and the person playing the cyberpsychotic
character should decide if she is up to the challenge.


Types of Cybernetic Implants
----------------------------

Characters can just about any body part replaced, except the brain,
which can only be enhanced. The basic units provide no more 
functionality than the part a character came with, nor are they any 
sturdier than organic pieces. However, unlike natural body parts, they 
readily serve as a reason to gain new Special Abilities (and Disadvantages).

All units are assumed to come with nearly limitless energy sources
that have no harmful side effects. All units are controlled by mental
commands, in the same way that a person can control her limbs by
thinking about it. The wiring can't be shorted. The unit's covering
matches the texture and appearance of the character's normal skin
and ﬁts virtually seamlessly with the rest of the character's body. 
Disadvantages and Limitations can lower the cost of the unit at a risk or
inconvenience to the character (such as having to recharge the power
cell or being susceptible to electricity-based attacks).

The description of each unit includes the number of upgrade slots
for that part. Once the upgrade slots are maxed out, the character must
replace one of the older upgrades to get a new feature.


Upper Body
----------

### Hand, Arm, and Shoulder Restrictions ###

These restrictions apply to all hand, arm, and shoulder cybernetic 
implants.

Skill Bonus, Skill Minimum, and Uncanny Aptitude may only be taken 
for skills the hand can use. Unless the character replaces both 
legs, the Fast Reactions ability only applies to skills that can be 
used with one hand. Ambidextrous may only be taken if both hands are 
replaced at the same time, though the Special Ability need only be 
purchased once per pair of hands. However, the Special Ability
takes up one slot in each hand.

For items requiring one hand to lift, the character receives
the full bonus. For items requiring two hands to lift, the character 
gets one-half of the bonus (rounded up), unless he has
both hands replaced. If the bonuses given by the hands are
different, than the character gets the average of the bonuses
(rounded up) when attempting two-handed maneuvers.

Restricted (R2), damage used as Strength to determine knockdown
only).

* Notes: None.

* Base Surgery Difficulty: 20


Other Parts
-----------

### Dermal Plate ###

Dermal plate replaces the character's skin. While the character gains 
protection from the new layers, the character can no longer feel with 
that part of her body unless she has a Special Ability installed
in a cybernetic replacement for that part of the body. Dermal plate may 
be layered over cybernetic limbs.

* Upgrade Slots: Two slots.

* Special Abilities Allowed: Attack Resistance; Environmental Resistance;
Hardiness; Natural Armor. 

* Notes: Environmental Resistance may only be taken with full-body dermal
armor.

* Base Surgery Difficulty: 10 per body part (limb, tail, tentacle,

Bonus, Skill Minimum, Uncanny Aptitude, Ventriloquism, Water
Breathing, Youthful Appearance.

* Notes: All Special Abilities must have the Limitation Burn-out
(R1), disappears after one hour. Additional ranks of Burn-out can be
added; one additional rank equals ﬁve less minutes of time. Gamemasters 
may allow characters to pay only the price and not the Character
Point cost for a one-time use of a drug. Likewise, characters who wish
to permanently rely on the drugs to get their Special Abilities should
instead take the Limitation Price (R2), must recharge drug dispenser
with a new dose after one hour.

* Base Surgery Difficulty: 10 (when installed alone in ﬂesh); 5 (when
installed in a cybernetic upgrade slot)


### Neural Jack ###

This device resembles a socket, used for interface with cyberdecks
and computers with matching ports. A cable connects the user's jack
with the machine, allowing for easy access. Generally, neural jacks are
installed on the neck or behind the ear, but since the character receives
the bonus only once per jack, some characters add jacks to other parts
of the body.

* Upgrade Slots: One slot.

* Special Abilities Allowed: Skill Bonus: computer interface/repair.

* Notes: A character may use the neural jack to improve her ability to 
work on the computer. With a computer that allows her access 
automatically (such as a ship she's authorized to be on), she may add 
her neural jack bonus to any one bonus that the computer provides. A 
neural jack with no upgrade merely allows a character to interface 
with a computer that has a neural port and no other means of input.

* Base Surgery Difficulty: 20


### Syntheskin ###

Syntheskin is a manufactured covering that looks and feels like natural 
skin (or scales or whatever the species in question has). It provides 
no protection and comes by default with all limbs and dermal armor.
Characters who took a Disadvantage that eliminated the syntheskin from 
the base package must purchase it separately when they get rid of that 
Disadvantage.

* Upgrade Slots: Not applicable.

* Special Abilities Allowed: Not applicable.

* Notes: None.

* Base Surgery Difficulty: 3


### Tail/Tentacle ###

This unit replaces or adds a tail or tentacle.

upgrade slot.

* Special Abilities Allowed: Ambidextrous; Armor-Defeating
Attack; Enhanced Sense: Touch; Extra Sense (any tactile type); Natural
Hand-to-Hand Weapon; Natural Ranged Weapon; Skill Bonus; Skill
Minimum; Uncanny Aptitude.

* Notes: Skill Bonus, Skill Minimum, and Uncanny Aptitude may
only be taken for skills the tail or tentacle can use.

* Base Surgery Difficulty: 10

+1 to base; cost +1 to base (+1,000 credits).


### Enhanced Cyberarm ###

Joined to the character at the shoulder, a full replacement arm can
offer a greater boost to a character's abilities than just replacing 
the hand (see next entry). 

Skill Bonus: Strength (R4), +4 to climb/jump, lift, and swim totals, 
with Cybernetics: Hand (R1) and Ability Loss (R1), only for single 
arm; installation difficulty 13; cost 13 (13,000 credits).

### Extra Cybernetic Parts ###

Characters may include certain additional pieces on themselves. Such 
cybernetic equipment includes shoulder, complete leg, tail, tentacle, 
eye, ear, nose, heart, scholarchip reader, neural jack, and drug

Extra Body Part Special Ability. Except for the scholarchip
reader, neural jack, and drug dispenser, each additional unit
adds 10 to the surgery difficulty. Furthermore, the character is
disoriented for a few days after recovering from the surgery (+5
to all difficulties), as she adjusts to having the new body part.

Improving Characters
====================

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

Once players have taken their characters through an adventure or
three, they'll want to improve or change them. This chapter provides
guidelines for accomplishing that.


Learning and Improving Skills
-----------------------------

When a player ﬁrst creates a character, she should use the character
creation guidelines for gaining attributes and skills.

Players whose characters have been through at least one adventure
can use Character Points, accumulated from completing adventures,
to learn new skills and improve old ones. Spending Character Points
this way may be done only between adventures.

In addition to Character Points, the character needs experience
with the skill, either through training or by attempting to use the skill
(through rolling its die code or its governing attribute's die code, 
regardless of the outcome) during an adventure. If the gamemaster 
decides that there is a signiﬁcant amount of training involved (such 
as improving a skill beyond 6D), or the character needs to ﬁnd a 
suitable teacher, that might become an adventure's focus. (The 
teacher must have a skill die code higher than the one the potential 
student currently has.)

The cost of getting one pip in a new base skill equals the number
before the "D" in the governing attribute's die code.

Example: *If a character wants to learn languages after an adventure 
and he has a Knowledge die code of 3D, the ﬁrst pip in languages
costs him three Character Points. The hero then has a 3D+1 in his
languages skill.

The cost of improving an existing skill is determined in the same way,
except that the number of dice in the skill (instead of in the attribute)
is used to determine the cost.*

Example: *A character has a dodge of 4D+2 and wants to increase
it. To raise the skill by one pip to 5D, the character must spend four
Character Points. To increase the skill to 5D+1 after the next scenario,
the character must spend ﬁve Character Points.*

The cost to get one pip in a new specialization equals one-half
of the number before the "D" in the governing attribute or skill's die
code. The cost to improve an existing specialization by one pip equals
one-half of the number before the "D" in specialization skill's die code.
(In both cases, round up.)

A character does not need the governing skill to get a specialization
in it. However, if he does have one, getting a specialization in it acts as
a bonus to the base skill when taking actions of that type, but it does
not also improve all uses of the base skill.

Example: *For a character with 6D in ﬁrearms to gain a energy weapons
specialization, he needs to spend three Character Points to get a +1 in
the specialization. The full ﬁrearms skill, however, stays at 6D.*

Specializations that are associated with a full skill improve when
the base skill improves.

A character may improve a skill or any of its specializations but not
both. In other words, a character may improve as many specializations
as he desires at the same time, though he cannot improve them at the
same time as he's improving the governing skill. Skills and specializations
may only be improved by one pip each in between each adventure.

Once characters reach 8D in a skill, gamemasters may choose to use the
upper limit rule for improving attributes (see that section for details).

Extranormal skills cost twice as much to learn as other skills. Skills
gained due to a Special Ability are not improved when that Special
Ability is improved. Instead, they are increased as a normal skill.


Improving Strength Damage
-------------------------

As a character's Strength or lift goes up or is altered by Special Abilities,
Disadvantages, or skill improvement, reﬁgure the Strength Damage die
code: Take the character's new Strength or lift (including any modiﬁers
from Disadvantages or Special Abilities) and drop the pips. Divide by
2, and round up. This is the Strength Damage die code.


Improving Attributes
--------------------

With the exception of Extranormal (such as Metaphysics) and Funds,
the attributes you choose for your character usually represent her
maximum potential. Most of the time, you'll improve your character's
attributes by training in one particular aspect (improving skills),
through temporary means (taking drugs), or with implanted equipment. 
Nonetheless, some freak industrial accident or bio-manipulation
experiment might provide you with a reason to improve your character's
base attributes. (Some characters, such as kids, might start with fewer
attribute dice, but their excuse for their attributes' improvement is
puberty.) There are two ways to do this.

The ﬁrst way is how kids improve their normal attributes and how
everyone improves their Extranormal attributes. The gamemaster may
chose to use this option for adult characters who want to increase their
normal attributes.

In the ﬁrst method, to boost an attribute by one pip costs 10 times
the number before the attribute's "D" in Character Points. Generally,
a single attribute may be raised only one pip per adventure, though
it's possible that the effects of the situation inﬂuence the character's
physical makeup for a while or the gamemaster may decide that the
situation was so life-changing that more than one attribute may be
boosted by more than one pip.

There is an upper limit using this method: Every time an adult
character boosts a normal attribute, the player rolls that attribute's
new die code and the gamemaster rolls one die less than the maximum
die code for the species, including any appropriate Special Abilities.
(The maximum for all attributes except Extranormal and Funds is 5D,
unless altered by a Special Ability, so the gamemaster would roll 4D.)
If the gamemaster's roll equals or exceeds the player's roll, the attribute
improves. If it does not, the attribute does not improve, the character
gets half the Character Points back, and the character has reached her
upper limit for that attribute. Ignore this upper limit rule for Funds
and Extranormal attributes.

In the second way, the gamemaster requires all adult characters to
take the Increased Attribute Special Ability (discussed in the 
"Character Options" chapter) in order to improve their Agility, Strength,
Mechanical, Knowledge, Perception, and Technical attributes. There is
no maximum bonus that the character may gain with this method,
aside from whatever roleplaying or adventure obstacles the gamemaster
decides to include.

### Effects of Character Options ###

When determining how many Character Points a player
needs to improve his character's skills and attributes, ignore
any modiﬁers provided by Advantages, Disadvantages, or
Special Abilities.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Changing Body Points
--------------------

As a character's Strength goes up or is altered by Special Abilities or
Disadvantages, you'll need to change the Body Points amount. Roll the
dice indicated by the Special Ability or Disadvantage (if applicable),
and add any pips or other modiﬁer. (Do not reroll the character's entire
Strength -- only the amount that changed.)Then add or subtract, as
dictated by the Special Ability or Disadvantage, that number from
the Body Points total.


Changing Wounds
---------------

As a character's Body Points go up or down, the Wound level changes.
For characters who rely solely on Wounds, the only way to alter how
quickly or slowly the character reaches each level is by changing his
damage resistance total. This could be through a change in Strength or
by acquiring more protective gear or protecting Special Abilities.


Gaining and Losing Character Options
------------------------------------

As players take their characters through adventures and develop
them, they may decide that the Advantages, Special Abilities, and
Disadvantages the characters started with don't ﬁt the current concept.
To be ﬂexible, there are ways you can accommodate your players' desire

to grow their characters. For example, an "enemy" might eventually be
killed, a character might be able to negotiate a way out of Debt, or an
Advantage Flaw might be "repaired."

Getting rid of and gaining Advantages, Special Abilities, and 
Disadvantages should only happen after the character has been used during
several adventures and has had a chance to come up with reasons for
character alteration.

These game mechanics for gaining Advantages, Special Abilities,
and Disadvantages apply only to individuals who seek to have them.
Because of an adventure or series of adventures, the members of a
group may each acquire the same new Advantage or Disadvantage.
In this case, each hero does not pay the cost or receive any Character
Point beneﬁts outlined here. The new Advantage can be considered
a reward for being part of the team and the scenario, while the new
Disadvantage would be a penalty.


Advantages
----------

There are two methods for acquiring new Advantages: (1) The
player pays, in Character Points, 5 times the rank of the Advantage. (2)
The player takes an equivalent amount of dice in Disadvantages and
pays a number of Character Points equal to the rank of the Advantage.
In either case, the player must come up with a well-crafted story for
getting the new Advantage that's backed by actual experiences in one
or more adventures. The story, and its related Advantage, must be
approved by the gamemaster.

Generally, a player may not remove an Advantage from a character,
but it might be lost in the course of roleplaying due to player negligence
(that is, continuously bad roleplaying or ignoring Disadvantages)
or some tragic game-world mishap (such as a Patron's city being
destroyed). If the loss occurred through no fault of the character, the
gamemaster may give the player a consolation gift of three Character
Points per rank in the Advantage, or may substitute an equally valuable
Advantage. Gamemasters should not reward the loss of an Advantage
through player negligence.


Disadvantages
-------------

There are also two methods for permanently overcoming a Disadvantage: 
(1) The player pays 10 times the die code of the Disadvantage.
(2) The player loses an equal number of Advantages and pays a number
of Character Points equal to the die code of the Disadvantage. As
with Advantages, the player must have a good tale and the character
has adequate adventuring experience before the gamemaster should
approve the loss of any Disadvantage.

Example: *If a character had Equipment (R3), he might also have a
Rank 3 Disadvantage tied to it. If the character can get rid of the equipment
(which he might not be able to do in some settings -- a cursed amulet or
a cybernetic spine, for example), then the Disadvantage goes away.*

When a player wishes to add another Disadvantage to her hero,
she receives an immediate bonus for this choice if she isn't using the
Disadvantage to help her get a new Advantage. For the new Disadvantage, 
the character receives a number of Character Points equal to
3 times the die code of the Disadvantage. However, the character now
has a new limitation to contend with!


Special Abilities
-----------------

Unless the gamemaster decides to reward a character with a Special 
Ability, it costs 5 times the sum of the Special Ability's base cost
plus the current number of ranks in Character Points -- and a really
good excuse -- to acquire or improve a Special Ability after character
creation. A character may improve a Special Ability by only one rank
after each adventure, unless there is some compelling reason to allow
otherwise. Gamemasters may disallow increases in Special Abilities if
they feel the reason for the improvement isn't good enough.

Example: *A character has Accelerated Healing at Rank 1. She
decides to spend some time in a monastery, learning how to improve it.
The cost in Character Points to increase her Special Ability to Rank 2 is
16 (5 times the sum of the base cost of 3 plus the current rank of 1).*

Characters can have their Special Abilities weakened and occasionally 
even lose them entirely, and they get no reward for this. In other
circumstances, the character could wish to use all his mental and
spiritual resources to defeat an otherwise unstoppable force.

In these instances, by sacriﬁcing one rank in a
Special Ability, a character receives 2 times the base
cost of the Special Ability in Character Points. If
the player wants to remove completely a Special
Ability from the character, however, he reduces the
Special Ability to one rank, receiving Character
Points for each rank lost, as above. In sacriﬁcing
the ﬁnal rank of the Special Ability, the character
receives in Character Points 7 times the initial cost
of the Special Ability. Costs of Enhancements and
Limitations are ignored. The character also, of
course, loses all Enhancements and Limitations
associated with that Special Ability when he permanently 
sacriﬁces it. (Getting the Special Ability
back requires the character to spend Character
Points for it as a new Special Ability.)

The act of losing Special Abilities does not typically count as an 
action. Even so, some circumstances may justify a Moderate willpower 
roll or the character's complete concentration for a full round to 
simulate the character summoning his deep inner resources.

The player can combine losing Special Abilities with gaining Special
Abilities to simulate an event that alters the character's extraordinary
abilities completely. In this case, if the gamemaster accepts the player's
explanation, simply trade the hero's current Special Abilities for 
Character Points and spend them on the desired new Special Abilities.


Gaining and Losing Special Ability Enhancements and Limitations
---------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible for a character to gain or lose control over a Special
Ability, beyond what increases in skill and Special Ability rank allow.
Unlike Advantages and Disadvantages, Special Ability Enhancements
and Limitations are fundamental to a Special Ability's manifestation in
a character or item. Enhancements and Limitations must be purchased
or overcome with Character Points, representing the character's greater
understanding of the Special Ability. Also, the gamemaster may not
allow some Limitations to be bought off without an excellent plot-related
explanation, especially if the Limitation is physical in nature. Unless the
Enhancement or Limitation relates to the character's understanding of
the Special Ability, such as many Minor Stigmas, a reasonable explanation 
of how the Special Ability has changed is also required.

Gaining a new Enhancement costs 8 times the desired rank times
the base cost of the Enhancement in Character Points. Although most
Enhancements have several possible ranks that can be purchased in
stages, common sense should apply. A Special Ability may obtain
new levels for the same Enhancement, but the nature of previously
added Enhancements cannot be altered, unless the Enhancements
are removed.

Example: *An Enhancement that provides an extra effect must be
purchased at the full cost of each desired effect. A player could not,
for instance, buy one rank of Additional Effect: Energy Sustenance
for Attack Resistance, and then later spend more Character Points
to increase the Enhancement rank and change it to attack reﬂection.

However, a character with an Additional Effect of stickiness 
on the Natural Ranged Weapon Special Ability could purchase additional
ranks of the version of the Enhancement.*

Eliminating a Limitation costs 10 times the die code of 
the Limitation in Character Points. As with Enhancements, it is 
possible to buy off a Limitation in stages, if the stages are related. 
The Debt Limitation probably couldn't be bought down
one level at a time, but a Flaw with multiple ranks could be,
if the Narrator allowed. The gamemaster may disallow buying off 
certain variations of Limitations because they are inextricably 
tied to the related Special Ability.

A character can also remove an Enhancement or acquire a Limitation 
after character creation. A character who purposely removes an
Enhancement from a Special Ability receives 4 times the rank times the
base cost of the Enhancement in Character Points. The character can't
rely on the Enhancement until the player buys it again. A character who
takes a Limitation for a Special Ability after character creation gains
5 times the rank times the base cost of the Limitation in Character
Points. Since it is unlikely (though not impossible) that a character
would do either of these deliberately, the player must come up with
a reasonable explanation for how the Special Ability has become less
useful. Again, the gamemaster may take away Enhancement or Limitations 
based on the adventure situation and does not necessarily have
to award points for it.


Game Basics
===========

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

This chapter deﬁnes how to play the game, from rolling the dice
to using skills. The basic unit of game time, order of play, and what
players can have their characters do on a turn are explained. 
Suggestions for determining the difficulty of actions are offered, 
including some examples.

The introduction offered an overview of how the game works, so
some of this may look familiar. However, this chapter clariﬁes a lot of
special situations that will undoubtedly come up during play.


Rolling Dice
------------

A die code shows how good a character is in a particular area, how
harmful a weapon is, how useful a Special Ability or tool is, and so
on. Each die code (also known as a value) indicates the number of
six-sided dice you roll (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, etc.), and sometimes an
added amount of "+1" or "+2" -- referred to as pips -- you add to the
total result you roll on the dice.

An Advantage, Special Ability, or piece of equipment may provide
a bonus to the roll. If the bonus is in the form of a die code (such as
+1D), then you add the listed number of regular dice to the amount
you would roll. If the bonus is in the form of a number (such as +2),
then you add the amount to the total that you rolled on the dice.

Example: *A shovel add 1D to digging attempts. A character who
decides to dig a hole uses her lift skill. If your character has a lift skill
of 4D, you would roll ﬁve dice to determine how well your character
dug the hole with the shovel.*


Wild Die
--------

Whenever any player, including the gamemaster, makes any roll, one
of the dice must be different from the rest (in size or color). Designated
as the Wild Die, this odd die represents the vagaries of life -- like the
direction of the wind affecting the ﬂight of a bullet -- that are too
small to warrant their own difficulty modiﬁers.

Example: *Your character's Agility attribute is 3D+1, so if your
character tried to jump onto a table, you would roll two regular dice
and one Wild Die.*

If the player has only 1D to roll, then that one die is always the
Wild Die.

If the player rolls a 6 on the Wild Die, this is called a Critical Success
and she may add the 6 to her total and roll the Wild Die again. As long
as she turns up Critical Successes on that die, she may continue to add
them to her total and continue to roll. If she rolls anything other than
a 6, she adds that number to the total and stops rolling.

If the player rolls a 1 on the initial toss of the Wild Die, this is called
a Critical Failure, and the gamemaster may chose one of two options
for the result, depending on the gravity of the situation.

1. The Critical Failure cancels out the highest roll. Then the player
adds the remaining values, and the roll is determined normally.

2. Add the dice results normally, but a complication occurs. The
gamemaster gauges the signiﬁcance of the complication by the total
generated -- from a funny, "nearly didn't do it" result for a high total
to a serious, "we have a problem" obstacle for a low total.

When using the second option, make certain the complication chosen
relates to the task attempted. It should serve as an extra, minor obstacle
the characters must now deal with or, more often, as a place to insert
a bit of comic relief. Only on rare occasions (such as numerous poor
decisions by the players) should a complication be without solutions or
even deadly. The complications can also serve as opportunities to bring
nearly invincible characters down to a more reasonable level.

Note: Unlike rolling a Critical Failure initially on the Wild Die,
no complications occur when a 1 shows up on later tosses of the Wild
Die in the same roll.


Improving a Roll
----------------

The average person fails at average activities nearly half of the time.
Characters aren't average people, so they need ways to beat those odds.
Thus, they have Character and Fate Points, which represent those
surges of adrenaline, sudden insights, and other unexplained helpful
acts of chance.

Players may not trade Character Points for Fate Points, nor may
they trade Fate Points for Character Points. A player may only spend
her Character and Fate Points on her character's rolls. She may not
spend more Character or Fate Points than the character has listed on
her sheet. Except when allowed by the gamemaster for exceptionally
cinematic situations, players may not use Character Points and Fate
Points on the same roll.

### Alternate Die Rolling Options ###

Some gamemasters prefer rolling fewer dice. To this
end, a die code simpliﬁcation chart has been included in an
appendix of this book. It offers two solutions for reducing
the number of dice while retaining some of the randomness
of rolling dice.

For converting die codes in the middle of a game without
referencing the table, multiply the number in front of the "D"
by 3 for tasks that ought to fail (such as the damage resistance
total of a cannon fodder character) or 4 for actions that
ought to succeed (such as something the players' characters
are doing).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Character Points
----------------

Whenever a player makes any roll (attribute, skill, damage, Special
Ability, and so on), he has the option to spend Character Points to
increase the total rolled. He may spend one Character Point for each
extra Wild Die rolled, to a maximum decided upon by the gamemaster
and based on the challenge level of the adventure. (For adventures with
easy challenges, the maximum is two; for more cinematic adventures,
the maximum is ﬁve; for universe-shaking ones, the maximum is
unlimited.)

A player may choose to spend Character Points before or after he
makes a roll -- or both -- but always before the gamemaster determines
the result. The gamemaster need not tell the player whether he should
spend more points to improve a roll.
Extra Wild Dice gained from spending Character Points each
work like a normal Wild Die except that a Critical Failure counts as
a 1; it does not adversely affect the roll. Because of the special nature
of Character Point Wild Dice, the player may wish to roll these dice
separately from his normal Wild Die.

Once used, the character loses the point. Players get Character
Points for their characters by overcoming obstacles, roleplaying well,
and having fun. They can also use Character Points to improve skills
(see the "Improving Characters" chapter for details).


Fate Points
-----------

Each players' character has a personal moral code, generally involving
a sense of honor and justice. The devotion to this code is represented
by Fate Points. Violating that code takes a little bit away from that
nature, which is represented by a loss of Fate Points.

Example: *Heroic characters receive Fate Points for doing good,
such as protecting innocents, bringing an evil character to justice
(regardless of the justice system's ﬁnal decision), preventing damage,
and saving a life (except the character's own). Heroic characters lose
Fate Points for performing evil actions, such as stealing, maliciously
destroying property, taking a life, and other terrible acts, especially if
they use Fate Points to accomplish that harm.*

Individual ethical codes may differ from the heroic code, but the more
well-deﬁned the code is, the easier it is for the gamemaster to determine
when to reward Fate Points -- and when to take them away.

When a player feels she needs even greater help for her roll, she may
spend a Fate Point to double the number of dice she normally gets for
that roll. However, the player only rolls one Wild Die. Furthermore,
anything that's not part of the character -- weapon damage die codes,
equipment bonuses, and so on -- is not doubled.

Example: *Your character has a demolitions skill with a die code of
4D+2. Normally, you would roll three regular dice and one Wild Die
and add two pips to the total. But this time, you want to make sure the
villain's car doesn't ever move, so you spend a Fate Point. This allows
you to roll seven regular dice and one Wild Die and add four pips to
the total (for a total of 8D+4, or twice what you'd normally roll).*

Usually, a player may use only one Fate Point per roll per round,
though a character may improve several different actions in a round
with several different Fate Points expenditures. Particularly beneﬁcial
or malicious deeds presented and roleplayed well by the player or 
gamemaster may allow additional Fate Points to be spent on a single roll.

In the general course of play, a Fate Point is useful for one roll only.
However, once per game session, a player may choose to spend a Fate
Point climactically, which doubles all of the character's rolls for that
round. The gamemaster also may allow players to spend Fate Points
climactically several times during the highest point of the adventure
(the climax).

Players may only spend Fate Points before making a roll. Furthermore, 
double the initial number before applying any die code penalties
and bonuses.

Once used, the character loses the Fate Point -- but he may earn
it back at the end of the game if it was used for a deed that supported
his moral code. However, if the character used a Fate Point to go
against his moral code, the gamemaster may decide that it costs an
additional Fate Point.

As characters become more experienced, the gamemaster may
include further restrictions on Fate Point use. Gamemasters might
allow moderately experienced characters (those with at least 6D in
several skills) to spend Fate Points only on actions that promote the
story line, while highly experienced characters (those with at least 9D
in several skills) might be permitted to use Fate Points only during
climactic moments in the campaign.


Using Skills
------------

At those times when there's a chance that a character may fail at an
action, that character must make a skill check. The player decides what
she wants her character to do and which skill is best for accomplishing
the task (sometimes with the help of the gamemaster). The gamemaster
determines a suitable difficulty number, which the player must meet or
beat by rolling the number of dice in the skill and adding the results.

### Game-Enhancing Cards ###

In this rulebook, you'll occasionally ﬁnd references to"card
use." One of the unique features of certain West End Games
systems is their game-enhancing card decks. These cards
can help players and gamemasters alter outcomes, inﬂuence
initiative, and make dramatic scenes even more exciting. You
can include one of these decks in your D6 Space games with
a little tweaking. The Torg card deck is available as a printed
deck on standard playing card stock and (as of this printing)
is still sold directly by West End Games. Check the West
End Games Web site, www.westendgames.com, for more
information, including deck availability.

Untrained Skill Use
-------------------

If a character doesn't have dice in the skill required to attempt an
action, she generally may use the die code of the attribute under which
that skill falls. This is sometimes referred to as defaulting to the 
attribute or using the skill untrained or unskilled. The gamemaster may
include an unskilled modiﬁer to the difficulty. This modiﬁer takes
into account that people who aren't trained or don't have experience
in certain tasks usually have a harder time doing them. Typically, this
modiﬁer is +5, but it could be as low as +1 for simple tasks or much
higher for complex plans. The gamemaster may rule that some situations, 
such as building a spaceship or performing brain surgery, are
impossible for anyone to attempt without the proper training and the
correct skills.

When attributes are given in the text along with the skill, such as
in spell descriptions, resisting Wounds, and so on, do not apply the
untrained modiﬁer. This also includes most uses of dodge and brawling
in combat situations, attempts to ﬁnd clues in a room with search, and
resisting interaction attempts or mental attacks with willpower.


Rounds and Initiative
---------------------

Generally, time in a roleplaying game doesn't matter too much. A
character may spend several hours searching a library, though only a
minute passes as far as the players and gamemaster are concerned.
To keep the story line moving, sometimes it's necessary to skip the
tedious parts.

More intense scenes require more detail. In these cases, time slows to
units of ﬁve seconds called rounds. Each character may take one action
in the round with no penalty. Unless the character has special skills or
abilities, additional actions increase the difficulty of performing each
task; this concept is dealt with later, in the "Multiple Actions" section.
Once a round ends, the next one begins, continuing until the scene ends
(with the task completed, the opponent subdued, and so on).

Since all characters in a scene are making actions in the same ﬁvesecond 
round, the actual length of game time taken up by an action is
usually less than ﬁve seconds. This is obviously the case when a single
character is performing multiple actions, but it is also true when one
character reacts to what another character is doing. Actions in rounds
are not simultaneous (actions out of rounds sometimes are).
Determining initiative does not count as an action.

Once rounds have been declared and depending on the situation,
the gamemaster applies one of three methods to determine in what
order everyone goes.


Initiative Method 1
-------------------

The ﬁrst method is to allow whoever makes the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
action (such as those surprising other characters in an ambush) to
act ﬁrst in the round. The characters retain the same order until the
scene ends.


Initiative Methods 2 and 3
--------------------------

The other two ways start out the same, by requiring the characters
involved to make Perception rolls to generate initiative totals. The
gamemaster makes one Perception roll for each character or group of
characters he controls, depending on the number and how important
each character is to the adventure. The character with the highest roll
takes her action ﬁrst. The character with the second highest roll then
takes his action, and so on. After the last character performs her action,
the round ends and a new one begins. Note that characters rendered
unconscious, immobile, or otherwise unable to act lose their action until
they wake up or get free, even if they haven't taken it already.

The gamemaster may chose then to keep the order for the entire
scene (the faster method) or have everyone roll at the beginning of
each round (the more realistic yet slower way).

The gamemaster and players may use Character Points, but not
Fate Points, to increase their initiative rolls if they want. Spending one
Character Point, for example, allows the player or gamemaster to add
the result of one extra Wild Die roll to the initiative roll.


Initiative Ties/No Rolls
------------------------

In the event of ties, or if the gamemaster chooses not to have the players 
roll to determine initiative, comparing attribute and skill die codes
can decide the order of actions. The character with the highest value in
the characteristic goes ﬁrst, and so on. Once a character has a spot in the
order, it doesn't change, regardless of how other characteristics compare.
Ties are broken by moving to the next factor and looking at those values.
The order: (1) ability or talent that allows the character to go ﬁrst, (2)
Perception, (3) search, (4) Agility, (5) dodge, (6) special equipment or
situation that allows the character to go before another character.


Optional Initiative Bonus
-------------------------

For every 2D over the base attribute in search (round down) or
4D in Agility (round down), a character receives +1 to his initiative roll.
Every six ranks in a Skill Bonus or Increased Attribute Special Ability
that affects Agility or search provides a +1 bonus.


Performing Actions in Rounds
----------------------------

A character does not need to declare what she intends to do until her turn
comes up in the round. Once the character decides to take her turn, she may
use as many actions as she wants, but her player must determine the 
multiaction penalty for the total number of actions that the character 
wishes to take in that round. The character does not need to declare 
when ﬁguring the multi-action penalty what she intends to do with all 
of her actions. Note that  waiting counts as an action (once per
each time the character wishes to wait). The character may take no 
additional actions once the multi-action penalty is ﬁgured. Any actions 
calculated into the multi-action penalty but that the character did not 
use by the end of the round are lost.

A character may take a few actions, wait, take a few more, wait
again, and so on, as long as the player has declared a sufficient number
of actions in which to do everything she wants her character to do
(including waiting).

A character may only interrupt another character's action if she has
waited and after that character has made the skill roll and spent any
points but before the gamemaster declares the result.

Example: *A character surprises a thug. Because she got the jump on
him, the gamemaster decides the character may act ﬁrst in this round.
The character decides to wait and see what the thug will do, choosing
to take one other action this turn. The thug takes a swing at her, so the
character decides to dodge. If the character has no ability that gives her
extra actions, she may take only one action without penalty. She used
that one action on waiting. When she makes her dodge roll, it's at -1D,
because it's the second action she's taking this round.*

Only a few instances exist in which the gamemaster may permit
a character to "move up" her turn and react to another character's
actions. These include catching a thrown object, resisting certain mental
attempts, and other situations that the gamemaster deems appropriate.
These do take the character's action, though the player can declare that
her character will perform multiple actions in the round. For the most
part, having a turn later in the round than another's simply means that
another character could take advantage of the situation faster.


Multiple Actions
----------------

Characters may attempt to perform several tasks in a single round,
or, if the action takes longer than one round to complete, in the 
same minimum time period. The more they try to do, however, the 
less care and concentration they can apply to each action. It
becomes more difficult to succeed at all of the tasks. Thus, for most 
characters, for each action taken beyond the ﬁrst, the player must 
subtract 1D from all skill or attribute rolls (but not damage, damage 
resistance, or  initiative rolls). Thus, trying to do four actions in one
round gives the character a -3D modiﬁer to each roll. For characters with 
an ability that increases their base number of actions, the multi-action 
penalty doesn't take effect until the character uses up his allotment of 
actions. For example, if a character with an action allotment of eight 
per round wants to do nine actions, each of the nine actions is at -1D.

Only equipment and weapons suited for quick multiple actions may
be used several times (up to the limit of their capabilities) in a round. 
Some examples include semi-automatic guns or items with little or no 
reload time, like hands or small melee weapons.

A character may not rely on any skill or attribute reduced to zero.


Actions that Take Time
----------------------

Each entry on this nonexhaustive list counts as one action taking no
more than ﬁve seconds to perform. The gamemaster may decide that
certain types of actions offer a bonus or special effect and, thus, have
requirements to perform. The suggested skill to use with each action
is included at the end of the task's description.

* Bash: Hit an opponent with a blunt weapon. (melee combat)
* Catch: Stop the movement of a thrown or dropped object or person.
  (The catcher must act later in the round than the person doing the
  throwing or dropping. This is one of the few cases where a character
  may "move up" his turn.) (throwing)
* Choke: Grab a person's neck and gripping tightly. (brawling)
* Communicate: Relay plans or exchange complex ideas and information 
  with other characters (more than a few words or one sentence).
  (an interaction skill or only roleplaying)
* Disarm: Remove an object from an opponent's hand. This action
  is treated as a called shot. (brawling, ﬁrearms, melee combat, missile
  weapons, throwing)
* Dodge: Actively evade an attack. (dodge)
* Entangle: Throw an entangling weapon at an opponent. (throwing)
* Escape: Break a hold. (lift)
* Grab: Latch onto an opponent. Depending on where the opponent
  was grabbed, he can take other actions. (brawling)
* Kick: Strike out at an opponent with a foot. (brawling)
* Leap: Jump over an opponent, onto a table, or any other such
  maneuver. (climb/jump)
* Lunge: Stab forward with a pointed weapon, such as a sword or a
  knife. (melee combat)
* Move: Maneuver 51% of the character's Move or more around
  the area. The gamemaster should call only for a roll if the terrain is
  challenging or the maneuvering complex. During some rounds, the
  gamemaster may decide that existing factors dictate all movement,
  regardless of length, require an action. (running, swim)
* Parry: Block an opponent's blow. (brawling, melee combat)
* Pin: Trap an opponent by either holding him to the ground or
  tacking a piece of his clothing to a wall or other nearby object. When
  pinning the whole opponent, this is the same concept as tackling. 
  Pinning prevents the victim from using the fastened part. (brawling, 
  melee combat, missile weapons, throwing)
* Punch: Strike out at an opponent with a ﬁst. (brawling)
* Push: Forcibly move an opponent. (brawling)
* Ready a Weapon: Draw or reload a gun or bow, unsheathe a knife,
  and similar actions. This generally does not require a skill roll, but the
  gamemaster may chose to require one related to the weapon in question
  for particularly stressful situations.
* Run Away: Flee from the scene. (running)
* Shoot: Fire a missile or projectile weapon. (ﬁrearms, missile
  weapons)
* Slash: Swing an edged weapon. (melee combat)
* Switch a Weapon or Equipment's Setting: Although rare, some
  weapons and equipment have more than one damage or effect setting.
  It takes an action to change the setting. This generally does not require
  a skill roll, but the gamemaster may chose to require one related to the
  item in question for particularly stressful situations.
* Tackle: Bodily overcome an opponent. Once tackled, the opponent
  can do no other physical actions other than speak or attempt to break
  the attacker's grip. (brawling)
* Throw a Weapon or Object: Toss something at an opponent. (throwing)
* Trip: Quickly force one or both of an opponent's legs upward. (brawling)
* Use a Skill or Ability: Perform a quick action related to a Special
  Ability the character possesses or a skill he wants to use. A character
  may not use a Special Ability he does not have, though he may use a
  skill he has no experience in (possibly at a penalty). Note that some
  skills and Special Abilities take longer than one action or one round to
  perform, so trying to do them in ﬁve seconds incurs penalties.
* Vehicle Maneuver: Perform a stunt in a moving vehicle. (exoskeleton
  operation, piloting, vehicle operation)
* Waiting: Watch for a better opportunity to perform an action. This
  does not require a skill roll, but it does take concentration.


Free Actions
------------

Free actions are anything a character can automatically perform except
under the most extreme conditions. They don't require a skill roll or much
effort. If the gamemaster thinks a task requires concentration (and has a
possibility of failure, thus requiring a skill roll), it's not a free action.

* speaking a few words to someone nearby
* a quick glance around a room (and possibly a roll of Perception)
* moving 50% or less of the character's Move over an easy area or
  up to a meter over more challenging terrain

Additionally, the following player actions do not count as character
actions:

* determining initiative
* rolling to resist damage
* rolling willpower or Knowledge to determine the emotional effects
  of the environment on the character


Related Skills
--------------

In some situations, two or more skills may suit the task at hand.
The gamemaster can declare that only one is suitable for the current
circumstances. Or he can choose the primary one and decide which
other skills are appropriate secondary, or related, skills that the character
can use to improve his chances with the primary skill. The gamemaster
sets difficulties for each skill. The character ﬁrst performs the related
skills, and then he attempts the primary one.

To determine the related skill's modiﬁer to the primary skill, the
gamemaster subtracts the difficulty from the total rolled with the
related skill; this determines the number of result points from the roll.
Then he divides that number by 2, rounding up, to get the modiﬁer
to the total rolled with the primary skill. The minimum related skill
modiﬁer is 1. If the skill total was less than the difficulty, the modiﬁer
is subtracted from the primary skill total. If the skill total was equal
to or greater than the difficulty, the modiﬁer is added to the
primary skill total.

The character may perform the related skills and the primary
skill successively, but the related skill modiﬁer is only good for
the one initially intended attempt and the character must make
that attempt within a short time of using the other skills. Should
the character decide to perform the primary skill and the related
skill at the same time, he takes the multi-action penalty.

Example: *Your character has to carefully place some charges
on a wall. You decide that the character ﬁrst examines the wall for
weaknesses (using the search skill). Once examination has been
completed and the search roll has been made, your gamemaster
lets you know that you beat the difficulty by four points. This
gives you a result point bonus of +2. You apply the modiﬁer to
your demolitions roll only, which must take place immediately
after your character's examination of the wall.*

Gamemasters also can use the related-skills guidelines for
deciding how well one person can help another person.


Preparing
---------

A character willing to spend twice as much time to complete a task
receives a +1D bonus for the die roll for every doubling of time, up to a
maximum bonus of +3D. However, the character can do nothing else
or be otherwise distracted (such as getting shot at) during this time.


Rushing
-------

A character can also attempt to perform an action that normally
requires two or more rounds (10 seconds or more) in less time. The
difficulty increases depending on how much less time the character
puts into the task: +5 for 25% less time, +10 for 50% less time, and
+20 for 75% less time. A character may not perform any task in less
than 25% of the normally needed time. Thus, to rush an hour-long
surgery into 30 minutes, the difficulty increases by +10.

Of course, not every task can be rushed. If in doubt, the gamemaster 
should ask the player to justify how the character can speed
up the task.


Groups
------

To save time, gamemasters may chose to roll one action for a group
of characters he controls. Any number can belong to the group. Each
member of the group does not have to perform exactly the same
maneuver, but they do need to take similar actions. A gamemaster
could make one roll for a pack of wolves who attack different characters, 
but he would have to separate the pack into those attacking and
those circling if the gamemaster wanted to have them perform those
distinctly different activities.


Choosing Difﬁculties
--------------------

There are two possibilities for assigning difficulties to a speciﬁc
action: a difficulty number or an opposed roll. Generally, the adventure
speciﬁes the difficulty and what skill is needed, but the gamemaster
may come across circumstances that were not foreseen. In such cases,
use these guidelines to decide what to do.

Certain circumstances (typically involving a character attempting
a task without a force actively opposing her, such as climbing a wall or
piloting a boat) may call for a static difficulty number. In these cases,
select a standard difficulty or use a special difficulty. Circumstances
involving an actively opposing force call for an opposed difficulty.


Standard Difﬁculties
--------------------

A standard difficulty is a number that the gamemaster assigns to an
action based on how challenging the gamemaster thinks it is. Existing
conditions can change the difficulty of an action. For instance, walking
has an Automatic difficulty for most characters, but the gamemaster
may require someone who is just regaining the use of his legs to make
a Very Difficult running roll to move even a few steps.

The numbers in parentheses indicate the range of difficulty numbers
for that level.

* Automatic (0): Almost anyone can perform this action; there is no
need to roll. (Generally, this difficulty is not listed in a pregenerated
adventure; it is included here for reference purposes.)

* Very Easy (1-5): Nearly everyone can accomplish this task.
Typically, tasks with such a low difficulty only are rolled when they
are crucial to the scenario.

* Easy (6-10): Although characters usually have no difficulty with
this task, an untrained character may ﬁnd it challenging.

* Moderate (11-15): There is a fair chance that the average character
will fail at this type of task. Tasks of this type require skill, effort, 
and concentration.

* Difficult (16-20): Those with little experience in the task must
have a lot of luck to accomplish this type of action.

* Very Difficult (21-25): The average character only rarely succeeds
at these kinds of task. Only the most talented regularly succeed.

* Heroic (26-30), Legendary (31 or more): These kinds of tasks are
nearly impossible, though there's still a slim chance that lucky average
or highly experienced characters can accomplish them.

Opposed Difﬁculties
-------------------

An opposed difficulty (also called an opposed roll) applies when 
one character  resists another character's action. In this
case, both characters generate skill totals and compare them. 
The character with the higher value wins, and ties go to the
initiator of the action.

In an opposed task, since both char acters are actively doing something, 
both  the initiator and the resisting character use up actions. This 
means that the resisting character can only participate in an
opposed task either if he waited for the initiating character to make 
a move or if he was actively preparing for the attempt. Otherwise, the 
gamemaster may allow a reaction roll of the appropriate skill as a free 
action in some circumstances, or he may derive a difficulty (see the 
derived entry under "Special Difficulties" for an example).


Special Difﬁculties
-------------------

There are two special and optional difficulties: Wild Die Only
and derived.

Wild Die Only: The standard difficulty of an action may be so
much lower than a character's skill value that rolling and totalling
dice would waste time. However, the gamemaster may feel that the
situation is such that a complication could greatly affect the outcome
of the scene. In such cases, the game master may require the player to
roll the Wild Die. A Critical Success result indicates that some special
bit of good fortune occurred, while a Critical Failure indicates a minor
complication. Any other result shows that the result is successful,
though nothing special.

Derived: Any time one character does something to another character or 
animate creature or object, the base difficulty equals 2 times
the target's relevant opposing attribute or skill (drop the pips.)
Gamemasters may further modify derived values, as the situation
warrants. Derived values do not get the unskilled modiﬁer if they
are determined from the governing attribute.

Example: *Your character attempts to intimidate a thug.
The gamemaster could use the standard intimidation difficulty of
10 or she could derive one from the thug's willpower skill, or, if he
doesn't have one, the governing attribute, Knowledge. If his Knowledge
has a die code of 3D+1, then the base derived difficulty is 6.* 


Generic Modiﬁers
----------------

The modiﬁers offered in a skill's list or a pregenerated adventure
may not cover all the gamemaster's needs. When conditions arise for
which there aren't pre-established modiﬁers, use the chart herein to
help at those times. Gamemasters can add these modiﬁers to opposed,
standard, or derived difficulty values.


Good Roleplaying Modiﬁer
------------------------

Gamemasters should reward good roleplaying by lowering the
difficulty a few points. The better the roleplaying -- and the more
entertaining the player makes the scenario -- the higher the modiﬁer
the gamemaster should include.


Unskilled Attempts
------------------

Remember that someone without training or experience might, with
blind luck, do better than someone with experience -- but generally
only that one time. There is no guarantee of future success. When a
character defaults to the attribute, ﬁgure in not only a difficulty 
modiﬁerof +1, +5, or more, but also adjust the result accordingly: 
the result won't happen as precisely or stylishly as someone with skill.

### Generic Difﬁculty Modiﬁers ###

*Modiﬁer: Situational Example*

* +16 or more: Overwhelming disadvantage -- Something affects the skill 
use in an almost crippling fashion (repairing a vehicle without any 
proper tools).

* +11-15: Decisive disadvantage -- The skill use is very limited by 
circumstance (trying to ﬁnd someone in complete darkness).

* +6-10: Signiﬁcant disadvantage -- The skill use is affected negatively 
(tracking someone through drizzling rain).

* +1-5: Slight disadvantage -- There is an annoying problem (picking a 
lock by ﬂashlight).

* -1-5: Slight advantage -- A tool or modiﬁcation that makes the skill 
use a little easier (small spikes on shoes for climb/jump).

* -6-10: Signiﬁcant advantage -- A tool or modiﬁcation that makes the 
skill use much easier (rope with knots is used for climb/jump).

* -11-15: Decisive advantage -- A tool speciﬁcally designed to make 
the job easier (complete language database used for languages).

* -16 or more: Overwhelming advantage -- An exceptional tool or 
modiﬁcation that speciﬁcally makes the skill use much easier 
(wilderness tools and equipment specially designed to help with survival).

Alternate Attribute Option
--------------------------

Sometimes it makes more sense to base a skill on a different attribute 
than the one it's under by default. In such cases as the gamemaster
designates, subtract the skill value from the attribute value to get the
number of skill adds. Then add those skill adds to the new attribute
and roll away. Some example alternate skill-attribute combinations
(and the reason for using each attribute) include:

* Climb/jump, running, swim: Strength for distance; Agility for
obstacles

* Flying/0-G: Strength for wings or to represent the physical strain
of rapid movement; Agility for obstacles


Determining Success
-------------------

If the total rolled on the dice is greater than the difficulty, the
attempt was a success. Ties generally go to the initiator of the action,
but certain circumstances dictate otherwise (such as the use of some
Special Abilities or determining the amount of damage done). The
description of the ability, challenge, or activity explains the results.


Result Points
-------------

Result points refer to the difference between the skill roll and
the difficulty. The gamemaster can use the result points to decide how
well the character completed the task. The gamemaster may allow a
player to add one-half of the result points (rounded up) as a bonus to
another skill roll or Metaphysics or Special Ability effect. One-ﬁfth of
the result points from an attack roll can be included as bonus to damage.
(Round fractions up.)


Second Chances
--------------

As characters tackle obstacles, they'll find ones that they can't
overcome initially. Gamemasters must rely on their judgment to
decide whether and when a character may try an action again. For some
actions, such as ﬁrearms or running, the character may try the action
again the next turn, even if she failed. For other actions, such as repair
(any kind) or con, failing the roll should have serious consequences,
depending on how bad the failure was. A small difference between the
difficulty number and the success total means the character may try
again next round at a higher difficulty. A large difference means that
the character has made the situation signiﬁcantly worse. She will need
to spend more time thinking through the problem or ﬁnd someone
or something to assist her in her endeavor. A large difference plus a
Critical Failure could mean that the character has created a disaster.
She can't try that speciﬁc task for a long time -- perhaps ever. This is
especially true with locks and computer programs.


Gamemaster's Fiat
-----------------

The rules are a framework upon which the gamemasters and their
friends build stories set in fantastic and dynamic worlds. As with most
frameworks, the rules work best when they show the least, and when
they can bend under stress. Keeping to the letter of the rules is almost
certainly counterproductive to the whole idea of making an engaging
story and having fun. To keep a story ﬂowing with a nice dramatic
beat, gamemasters might need to bend the rules, such as reducing the
signiﬁcance of a modiﬁer in this situation but not in another one,
or allowing a character to travel a meter or two beyond what the
movement rules suggest.

### Result Points and Success ###

Here are some guidelines for describing different levels
of success. Use the result points of the roll -- the difference
between the skill total and the difficulty -- to decide on the
exact level.

**Minimal (0):** The total was just barely enough. The character hardly 
succeeded at all, and only the most minimal effects apply. If "minimal 
effects" are not an option, then maybe the action took longer than 
normal to succeed.

**Solid (1-4):** The action was performed completely, but without frills.

**Good (5-8):** The results were better than necessary and there may be 
added beneﬁts.

**Superior (9-12):** It is almost certain that there are additional beneﬁts 
to performing an action this well. The character performed the action 
better, faster, or more adeptly than expected.

**Spectacular (13-16):** The performance of the action was
deft and expert. Observers would notice the ease or grace with
which the action was performed (if applicable).

**Incredible (16 or more):** The skill performance was of 
such dazzling quality that, if appropriate to the task, it could
become the subject of conversation for some time -- it's at
least worth writing home about. Gamemasters should dole
out some signiﬁcant bonuses for getting this large of a roll.

Example: *A character who is trying to use the survival
skill to forage for food gets a minimal success -- she ﬁnds
"subsistence level" food; it's barely better than garbage. The
next day she gets a spectacular result -- not only does she
ﬁnd good, wholesome food, but she ﬁnds enough for two
days instead of one.*

Common Difﬁculties and Modiﬁers
-------------------------------

You can ﬁnd the more commonly referenced difficulties listed
on the Reference Sheet at the back of this book. With these plus the
generic difficulties and modiﬁers described previously, you can run
just about any adventure. The next several chapters include more, and
more detailed, difficulties.


Movement
========

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

Getting from here to there by any means -- running, swimming,
ﬂying, using a vehicle, you name it -- is what this chapter's all about.


Running
-------

The difficulty to cover rapidly a distance on foot is determined by
the number of extra movements the character takes. One movement
equals the character's Move value; two movements equals twice the
Move value, and so on. For each movement beyond the ﬁrst, add 5 to
the base difficulty of zero.

Example: *A character with a Move of 10 meters per round who
wants to move 20 meters in one round has a running difficulty of 5, while
a character who wants to move 40 meters has a difficulty of 15.*

A character who fails his running roll in the ﬁrst round covers only
his Move or may even trip, depending on how badly the player missed
the roll. See the "Accelerating and Decelerating" section for details on
what happens in subsequent rounds.


Swimming
--------

A hero's swimming Move equals half his normal Move (rounded
up). One movement while swimming equals the swimming Move, two
movements equals twice the swimming Move, and so on. Increasing
this rate likewise increases the base difficulty of 5 by +5 for each 
movement beyond the ﬁrst. Thus, the difficulty for a character to move 2
times his swimming speed is 10 (5 for the base difficulty plus 5 for
the additional movement).

Without preparation, a character may hold his breath for a number
of seconds equal to 5 times a roll of his Strength or stamina. 
Pre-oxygenating his lungs gives a character a bonus. The maximum any character
can hold his breath with preparation is 10 times a roll of his stamina
in seconds, though this requires having the stamina skill. The bonus
should be much less for the average person.


Climbing
--------

Characters who have the climb/jump skill can move up a surface at
their normal Move (barring adverse environmental factors) with a base
difficulty of 5. Those without such a skill move at half their normal
movement rate. Increasing the rate increases the difficulty by +10 for
each additional one-half of the base climbing Move (rounded up).
Example: *A character with a running Move of 10 and without the
climb/jump skill wants to move quickly up a tree. His base climbing
Move is 5. To increase this to eight meters per round means a difficulty
of 15 (5 to climb the tree plus +10 to increase the movement by onehalf, 
or three meters, of his base climbing Move).

Additional modiﬁers can be found in the "Example Skill Difficulties" chapter.


Jumping
-------

A character's total leaping distance (vertically and horizontally)
from a standing position equals one-quarter of his Move in meters
(rounded up). The base difficulty is 5 to move this distance, and +10
for each additional two meters (vertically and horizontally) the 
character hopes to cover. If there is enough room, the character may try
running before jumping. The character may add 5 to his skill total per
round of the running start, up to a maximum of +10 (two rounds).
The character must have beat the running difficulty in both rounds in
order to get the full bonus.

Additional modiﬁers can be found in the "Example Skill Difficulties" chapter.


Flying Characters
-----------------

Characters who ﬂy do so at the base rate designated in the Special
Ability or equipment description. To increase this rate, use the same
rules as for running, except that the character relies on the ﬂying/0-G
skill. Characters may not use this skill unless they have a means of
propelling themselves through the air or they are in a zero-gravity
environment.

See the"Vehicles and Aerial Characters" section later in this chapter
for more details on ﬂying movement.


Short Distances
---------------

A character may move up to 50% of his movement rate (swimming, ﬂying, 
or base Move) without this counting as an action. Thus, a character 
with a base Move of 10 could move ﬁve meters on land or 2.5 meters 
in the water with no action penalty.


Maximum Movement
----------------

Characters may perform only one movement action of each type
per round, unless a Special Ability allows them to do otherwise.
Gamemasters may choose to limit the speed at which characters
may travel to 4 times the Move rate for each type of movement.


Accelerating and Decelerating
-----------------------------

When it becomes important to the scenario, such as a race or a
chase scene, the gamemaster may choose to include acceleration and
deceleration rules for running, swimming, and ﬂying characters.

A character may increase his current movement rate by up to 2
times that rate, regardless of whether his movement roll would allow
him to travel a greater distance. The maximum increase is 2 times the
character's base Move for that type of movement.

Example: *A character with a base walking Move of 10 has a maximum 
swimming change of 10 -- 2 times his swimming Move of 5.*

Example: *A character with a Move of 10 is chasing a thief, who just
swiped her cred-key lanyard. In the ﬁrst round, she may move up to 20
meters, which has a running difficulty of 5. In the second round, she
can increase her speed to 40 meters, which has a running difficulty of
15. If, in the second round, the player generates a running total of 20,
by the acceleration rules, she may only move 40 meters, even though
her running total meets the difficulty to move 50 meters.*

Similarly, if a character does not make a movement roll that would
allow him to move at the previous round's rate, that character 
automatically slows by 2 times his base Move. (The gamemaster may lower the
movement even more if the player rolled particularly poorly.) In other
words, subtract 2 times the base Move from the current movement rate
to get the new movement rate. If this makes the current movement zero,
then the character stops. If it's less than zero, the character trips.

Example: *The character chasing the thief increased her speed to a
rate of 40 meters per round. To maintain this speed, her player needs
to continue generating a total of 15 with the character's running skill.
If the player gets less than 15, then her character's speed drops to 20
meters per round (40 minus 2 times her base Move of 10).*

Characters traveling more than 4 times their base movement rate
must slow down gradually or risk hurting themselves by stopping
suddenly.


Fatigue
-------

Keep in mind that most characters cannot move rapidly for long
periods of time. Determine a suitable length of time depending on
existing conditions, the Strength of the character, and any relevant
Special Abilities she has. Any additional fast movement beyond that
predetermined length requires a fatigue modiﬁer of +3 to the difficulty
for each additional round that she continues running. The modiﬁer is
cumulative. Thus, one round beyond the maximum is +3, two rounds
is +6, and so on.

The gamemaster may use the fatigue modiﬁer for any repetitive
action performed for an extended period of time. They can also use
it as the modiﬁer to a base difficulty of 5 when using the stamina or
willpower skill in an attempt to overcome the fatigue.

### Movement Difﬁculty Modiﬁer ###

*Base Difficulty for Characters: 0 (running); 5 (other movement)*

*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Easy terrain (ﬂat surface, smooth water, using a ladder, light breeze, 
light rain or fog): 0

* Moderate terrain (uneven surface, small obstacles, choppy water, 
climbing a tree, strong winds, heavy rain or fog): +5

* Rough terrain (large but negotiable obstacles, strong undercurrent, 
climbing a rough wall, ﬂying near unyielding obstacles such as 
pillars or trees): +10

* Very rough terrain (dense and large obstacles, stormy weather, a 
few airborne hazards, hail): +15

* Hazardous terrain (mineﬁeld, narrow walkway, many airborne 
hazards, large waves, climbing a smooth surface, complete 
darkness): +20

* Very hazardous terrain (corridor ﬁlled with falling debris and 
explosions, swimming or ﬂying in a hurricane): +25 or more

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Other Movement Options
----------------------

The gamemaster may include additional modiﬁers or require an
additional related skill roll for any form of movement, depending on
surrounding conditions, such as high winds, numerous obstacles, slick
surfaces, sharp turns, and so on.


Vehicles and Aerial Characters
------------------------------

Vehicle actions work like normal character actions, with some
additional game mechanics for special situations.

Much of the information found in this section applies equally well
to ﬂying characters, particularly the details on stunts.


Vehicle Movement
----------------

Vehicles have ﬁve speeds of movement: stopped, cautious, cruising,
high, and all-out. They may make one movement action per round.

* Stopped: The vehicle is motionless. This requires no roll. Air vehicles
should be on the ground when at this speed level.

* Cautious: The vehicle travels at half its Move. This is generally a
free action requiring no roll, but terrain conditions may increase it from
its base difficulty of zero. Air vehicles at this level must be attempting
to reach a higher or lower altitude at this speed; they cannot maintain
altitude at cautious.

* Cruising: The vehicle travels at its Move. This requires an action,
but since it has a base difficulty of zero, the character need only roll if
movement conditions dictate otherwise.

* High: The vehicle travels at twice its Move. This requires an 
exoskeleton operation, piloting, or vehicle operation roll with a base 
difficulty of 5, modiﬁed by existing conditions.

* All-out: The vehicle travels at four times its Move. This requires
an exoskeleton operation, piloting, or vehicle operation roll with a base
difficulty of 10, modiﬁed by existing conditions.

Vehicles may travel anywhere between half their current speed and
the full current speed at each level. Rapid acceleration and deceleration
are considered stunts and dealt with later in this section.


Stunts
------

For normal vehicle use or casual ﬂying under ideal conditions, a
character need not make a skill roll. When the conditions turn less than
favorable or he decides to attempt a fancy maneuver, his exoskeleton
operation, piloting, or vehicle operation skill plus the vehicle's 
Maneuverability code or his ﬂying/0-G skill determines his success.

Rapid acceleration and deceleration also warrant rolls, enhanced by
the vehicle's Maneuverability, to see if the operator maintains control.
These maneuvers have an initial difficulty of 10, adjusted based on
existing conditions (see the "Stunt Difficulties and Modiﬁers" chart for
some suggestions). A vehicle or ﬂying character may reduce or increase
movement by two levels in one round. Failing this roll means that the
character has lost control for one round. If some immovable force doesn't
stop the vehicle or character during that round, he may attempt to regain
control (with a base difficulty of 15) on the following round.

If a character wishes to perform any other actions in addition to 
exoskeleton operation, piloting, vehicle operation, or ﬂying/0-G, he 
must make the appropriate skill rolls for all actions, reduced by the 
multi-action penalty, regardless of the situation. The base difficulty 
for normal operation becomes 5. Stunts still have their established base 
difficulties.

### Terrain Conditions ###

For modiﬁers due to various terrain conditions, use the
"Movement Difficulty Modiﬁers" table.


### Vehicle Familiarity ###

Use the following table when a character is not familiar
with the vehicle she needs to operate. If the character does
not have the correct operating skill at all, these difficulties
are in addition to the untrained modiﬁer.

*Vehicle Type: Modiﬁer*

* Very common or simple (car, pickup, bicycle): +3
* Common (farm tractor, motorcycle, motorboat, snowmobile): +6
* Moderately common (speedboat, bus): +8
* Uncommon (ultralight plane, tank, hang-glider, unicycle): +11
* Unusual (prop plane, glider): +14
* Rare (jet, submarine): +17
* Exotic (spaceship, powered armor): +20
* Has a manual for the vehicle in a language the character 
  can understand: -3

Ramming and Sideswiping Vehicles
--------------------------------

Ramming is done with the nose of a vehicle, while sideswiping is done 
with its side. The character makes the appropriate vehicle roll,
including the vehicle's Maneuverability. If the character fails the 
roll, the vehicle misses and spins. Land and vehicles turn up to 180 
degrees and lose power, while space vehicles continuing spinning. 
The character must then spend one round starting it or regaining 
control and another getting back in the right direction. Should the 
character instead succeed, she keeps the vehicle reasonably straight 
and may try for another sideswipe or ram on the next turn. The pilot 
of an air vehicle that rams or sideswipes another vehicle automatically 
loses control. About the best she can hope for is to make a successful, 
but rough, landing.

Both vehicles take damage (the mechanics of this are explained
later in this section) in a successful ram or sideswipe.

### Vehicle and Passenger Damage ###

*Damage Total > Resistance Total By: Vehicle Damage (Passengers Suffer...)*

* 1-3: Very Light (No damage)
* 4-8: Light (1/4 Damage Total)
* 9-12: Heavy (1/2 Damage Total)
* 13-15: Severe (3/4 Damage Total)
* 16+: Destroyed (All Damage Total)

Note: All modiﬁers are cumulative. A vehicle may take an unlimited 
number of Very Light and Light levels of damage. At Heavy or above,
any additional level of damage above Very Light bumps the damage to 
the next level.

Gamemasters may include or substitute damage to other systems if the 
vehicle has them (ex., weapons, navigation, or sensors).

* Very Light: Vehicle loses 1D from Maneuverability for this round 
and the next.

* Light: Vehicle loses 1D from Maneuverability or, if at 0D in 
Maneuverability, top move speed is decreased by one level. The loss 
or modiﬁer remains until repaired.

* Heavy: Vehicle loses 2D from Maneuverability or, if at 0D in 
Maneuverability, top move speed is decreased by two levels. The loss 
or modiﬁer remains until repaired.

* Severe: Vehicle is out of control, decelerating by two levels each 
round until it comes to a stop or crashes into something.

* Destroyed: The vehicle will never operate again.

Vehicle Attacking and Dodging
-----------------------------

The base difficulty to hit a vehicle is 10, modiﬁed by distance and
the sizes of the attacker and the defender (using the scale modiﬁer
listed in the "Combat Options" chapter). That means a person shooting a 
car has a +6 to his attack total, while a car sideswiping another
car has no modiﬁer.

If the driver wishes to ﬁre a small-arms weapon, he must make both
an Easy exoskeleton operation, piloting, or vehicle operation roll (modiﬁed
by the vehicle's Maneuverability code) and a ﬁrearms roll. Because he's
doing two actions, he also incurs a multi-action penalty to both rolls.
Drivers cannot generally ﬁre vehicle-mounted weapons while maneuvering 
the vehicle. Passengers may shoot with few or no penalties. (Note
that these actions would not be possible in some vehicles.)

A character may also attempt to maneuver the vehicle out of the
way of incoming projectiles or other vehicles. Instead of the dodge skill,
the character uses his exoskeleton operation, piloting, or vehicle operation
skill plus the vehicle's Maneuverability code. Use the active partial or
full defense rules for characters to determine the new defense total.
The defense total becomes the new combat difficulty and is in effect
until the character's turn in the next round.


Vehicle Damage
--------------

When a vehicle takes damage from a weapon or another vehicle,
it's the level of destruction that matters. Use the following guidelines
and compare the result to the "Vehicle and Passenger Damage" chart.
Modify the damage total of the attacker or the damage resistance total
of the target by the scale modiﬁer, as appropriate for the situation.

A vehicle's damage resistance total equals its Toughness plus the
value of any armor. Character Points or Fate Points may not be spent
on this roll.

With weapons, compare the weapon's damage total to the target's
damage resistance total, including the scale modiﬁer for the vehicle (if
the gamemaster uses that option).

When a vehicle collides with something else, decide how fast it was
going when it made the collision and modify it based on the circumstances 
of the collision. Compare that to the damage resistance total.
Should two vehicles be involved, both take damage. See the sidebar
for the speed and collision modiﬁers.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Speed Damage Modiﬁer ###

*Speed at which the damaged vehicle is traveling: Damage*

Stopped: 2D
* Cautious: 4D
* Cruise: 6D
* High: 8D
* All-out: 10D


### Collision Damage Modiﬁer ###

*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Head-on: +3D
* Rear-end, sideswipe: -3D
* Nose to side: 0
* Into something very hard: 0
* Into something yielding: -1D or more

Note: Modiﬁers are cumulative. Situation is the one in which
the damaged vehicle is.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Crew and Passenger Injuries
---------------------------

Depending on how badly damaged the vehicle becomes, the crew
and passengers may be harmed, too. Use the"Passengers Suffer" column
of the "Vehicle and Passenger Damage" chart as a guideline. Adjust it
based on how much the passengers are exposed (for example, motorcycles 
and canoes offer little protection to their cargo).


Leaping Out of a Vehicle
------------------------

Leaving a land or water vehicle moving at less than 10 kilometers
per hour is a Very Easy acrobatics or Agility roll (or climb/jump if the
character leaps from the vehicle). If the vehicle is moving faster than
that, the base difficulty becomes 15, with +1 added to it for every 10

kilometers per hour the vehicle is traveling (rounded down). 
Additionally, the character takes damage from the fall, at a rate of 1 
for every 15 kilometers per hour the vehicle is moving (rounded up) 
minus the result points from the roll.

Example: *If the driver of a car traveling at 90 kilometers per hour
decided to leave the vehicle before it hit the tree it was traveling toward,
the difficulty would be 24 (90/10 = 9, plus the base difficulty of 15).
She would also take 6 points of damage unless she sufficiently succeeded 
at her jump (90/15 = 6).*


Repairing a Vehicle
-------------------

The difficulty to repair a damaged vehicle depends on the amount
of damage and availability of parts and tools. See the repair category
description in the "Example Skill Difficulties" chapter for difficulty
and modiﬁer suggestions.


Sample Vehicles
---------------

See the "Equipment" chapter for sample planetary vehicles, their
costs, and their game characteristics.


Space Travel
============

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

Some characters might ﬁnd sticking around one planet fun, while
others get the yen to explore the galaxy. This chapter offers ideas on
ﬁnding passage and operating a ship.


Getting around the Galaxy
-------------------------

### Your Own Ship ###

By earning enough credits, borrowing a sufficient amount of funds
(probably illegally and with plenty of strings attached), or getting an
inheritance, a character can obtain her own starship. Generally, these ships
have plenty of problems, but at least it's something to call one's own!
Patrons and employers might also provide a ship, while contacts
might be able to help the character gain access to one temporarily.


### Charter a Ship ###

Characters can hire an independent ship captain to take them to a
planet. While more expensive than commercial liners -- some chartered 
ships charge tens of thousands of credits -- they generally offer
more privacy and more travel freedom. The characters can often pick
the departure and arrival timetable, and they don't necessarily have to
go to popular destinations.


### Booking Passage ###

Depending on the gamemaster's setting, it might be possible to
book passage on a passenger liner or transport that has regular service
to one of several major worlds. Accommodations range from spartan (a
seat and perhaps a meal for short journeys) to staterooms with all the
luxuries one could possibly imagine. Naturally, costs match the "style"
one travels in, from a few hundred credits for a short trip on a cheap
transport to many thousands of credits for luxury cruises. Alternatively,
characters can save a few credits by booking passage on a freighter with
cargo destined for the planet they want to visit. Many freighters have
a spare bunk or two -- and few other amenities. Some freighters may
even take on working passengers, who pay for part or all of their passage
by performing some of the less desirable duties on the ship.


Sample Ships
------------

You can ﬁnd sample ships, including a light freighter suitable for
most travel needs, and guidelines for creating new ones in the "Basic
Ship Design" chapter near the end of this book.


Encounters in Space
-------------------

Unless the characters travel well-established routes, plenty of things
exist in space that can make the trip rather exciting -- whether or not
a mishap occurs in navigation or drive use.


### Local Space Patrols ###

Each planet with interstellar drive capability
generally has its own space navy. In some campaigns, there might also
be an interstellar police force. Some might turn out to be quite helpful,
while some prefer to keep all travel under their control.


### Traders ###

From owner-operated light freighters to gigantic corporate
and military bulk haulers, the space ways are ﬁlled with folks traveling 
around the galaxy, hawking their goods or taking things to where
they're wanted. Traders, legal and illegal, can prove good -- perhaps
even the only -- sources of information about their destinations, space
routes, and new jobs.


### Pirates ###

Unwilling or unable to make it legitimately, pirates prefer
to acquire their goods from other ships. They might prey on the edges
of populated regions, or they could set up "road blocks" that cause an
interstellar drive to drop its ship into normal space. Privateers are pirates
legalized by one or more government to attack certain ships.


### Slavers ###

Similar to pirates, slavers look for sentient beings to steal
and sell. Generally, these go into the service as gladiators or slaves to
crime lords (some of whom might be legitimate heads of corporations
or governments).


### Natural Hazards ###

Rogue planetoids, gas clouds, immense asteroid ﬁelds, energy storms, 
and other interstellar phenomena can interfere with interstellar travel, 
causing the ship to drop into normal space, take damage to systems, or 
throw the ship off course.


### Unexplored Systems ###

Alien civilizations, metal and mineral deposits, 
potentially habitable planets, lost caches of artifacts and technology,
long-forgotten colonies, and so much more exist in this galaxy, awaiting
discovery, whether on purpose or by accident.


Starship Operation: A Ship's Drives
----------------------------------

Ships have two types of drives: in-system (or sublight) drives and
interstellar drives.


### In-System Drives ###

In-system drives are used for getting off of a planet as well as traveling
around a system. They could take a ship to another planet, but generally
only generation or automated ships attempt such a journey.


### In-System Benchmarks ###

Here are some rough guidelines for in-system travel times.

* Five minutes to ﬂy from orbit to a safe interstellar transition point.
* Half an hour to ﬂy from a planet to one of its moons.
* Two to six hours to ﬂy from one planet to the nearest planet in
  the system.
* Anywhere from 10 to 48 hours to ﬂy from a star to the outer
  limits of the system, depending upon distance and the presence of
  any hazards such as asteroid belts or gas clouds. As one example, a
  typical system of a single yellow star and less than a dozen signiﬁcant
  planetary bodies would take about 15 hours to reach the outer limit
  from a terrestrial world relatively near the star.


### Interstellar Drives ###

Assuming that the gamemaster allows interstellar travel in the setting,
these types of drives can take a variety of forms, but for sake
of game mechanics, they all work the same way. Essentially,
they accelerate the ship to near-light speeds and then fold time
and space, create a temporary wormhole, or drop the ship into
another parallel yet connected dimension. Gamemasters who
want to add a little excitement to interstellar journeys can have
space debris or even the nature of the wormhole or subdimension 
negatively effect space travel.


### Interstellar Drive Ratings ###

An interstellar drive is ranked by a "rating." The higher the
number, the faster the drive. Most civilian ships have a Rating 0.5 
or lower drive, while military vessels typically have a Rating 1 or 
higher engine.

Each interstellar journey has a duration. Divide the duration by 
the ship's rating to ﬁnd out how long it takes the ship to reach the 
destination.


### Interstellar Benchmarks ###

Here are some guidelines for how long it generally takes
to get from one planet to another with an interstellar drive.
A die code is given in parentheses after the general time, for
gamemasters who want a quick of coming up with distances
between star systems. Once a time is rolled, unless the gamemaster 
decides that there are many hazards that could alter
the path, the gamemaster should write it down in his own
gazetteer.

* Systems are within the same sector: A few days (1D).
* Systems are within the same region but different sectors: Several 
  days (2D).
* Systems are in neighboring regions: Several weeks (2D).
* Systems are in regions distant from each other: Several
  months (2D).
* Route is well-traveled: Reduce the time by half.
* Route is known to have many random hazards: Add 1D
  of the base time unit (days, weeks, or months) to the time it
  takes to travel it.


### Navigation Computers ###

To handle the overwhelming complexities of calculating interstellar 
trips, most ships are equipped with navigation computers. A ship's
astro-navigator uses the navigation computer to plot a safe trip through
interstellar space. Navigation computers hold a tremendous amount
of data, storing the coordinates for the locations of stars, planets,
debris, gravity wells, asteroid ﬁelds, gas clouds, and other hazards.
Navigators use this information to determine the best routes to avoid
these obstacles.

As a route becomes well-known and its hazards are better understood, 
interstellar journeys can be plotted with more precision at faster
speeds. In some cases, travel times between speciﬁc planets may decrease.
In other cases, large enough obstacles may drift into the known route
and cause the time to increase.

In general, the greater the physical distance between planets, the
longer the journey in hyperspace takes. However, even systems that
are in close proximity to one another may require roundabout routes
because of debris and other hazards.

### Space Navigation Modiﬁers ###

*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* No navigation computer: +30
* Each extra hour added to trip: -1
* Each hour saved on trip: +1
* Obstacles (gas clouds, large space debris, black holes): +1 or more


### Shield Deployment ###

*Number of Areas: Difficulty*

* 1: 10
* 2: 15
* 3: 20
* 4: 25


### Space Navigation Results ###

*Result Points: Result*

* +5 or more: Saved an hour on the trip per 5 points over the 
  difficulty (round down).
* 0 to +4: Trip occurred without mishap.
* -1, -2: A radiation surge or other mishap affects the drive's 
  performance and damages another system on the ship (gamemaster
  selects). The characters need to use the appropriate repair skill 
  with a Moderate difficulty to ﬁx it. The trip is extended
  by 2D hours.
* -3, -4: The calculations were good enough to get the characters 
  to a destination, just the wrong one (perhaps from a computer 
  malfunction or an unplotted obstacle).
* -5, -6: The interstellar drive cut-out to avoid a collision 
  with an unplotted obstacle. A Moderate ﬂight systems repair roll is
  necessary to get the engines back on line. The characters also need 
  to plot a new course.
* -7 or more: The computer refuses the calculation and requires 
  them to be reﬁgured.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Using Interstellar Drives
-------------------------

When characters wish to travel to another system (and they didn't
get someone else to do the driving), they follow four steps:

1. Determine the trip's destination and duration.

2. Make calculations for the interstellar journey.

3. Figure out the navigation difficulty number.

4. Find out the navigation results.

**Determine the Trip's Destination and Duration:** The ﬁrst step
a ship's captain needs to do is decide where she's going and how she
wants to take to get there. Use the "Interstellar Benchmarks" sidebar to
determine the time. Once the base duration is determined, the navigator 
may then divide that number by her drive's class to get the actual
amount of time the ship will take (assuming perfect conditions).

**Make Calculations for the Trip:** Figuring out the best route then
inputting it into the computer isn't easy, and even with the incredible
advances in computers. How much time it takes to perform the calculations 
depends on where the ship's supposed to end up. A character can
rush the calculations, taking the rushing penalty (see the"Game Basics"
chapter for details). Many ship captains begin navigation calculations
while they wait in space dock, so they can leave as soon as the local
authorities clear them for departure.

Use these guidelines to ﬁgure out how much time it takes to make
the navigation calculation.

* Well-plotted route or precalculated coordinates: 1 minute.

* Known systems but best route has not been determined: 30
minutes.

* Never been to the system: Several hours.

* Lost because of a miscalculation or unknown obstacle: 1 day.

**Figure Out the Navigation Difficulty Number:** All trips have a
base difficulty of Moderate, with modiﬁers that adjust it for easy trips
(such as one core world to another) or much higher for particularly
perilous routes. Use the accompanying chart to determine the ﬁnal
difficulty.

**Find the Space Navigation Results:** Once the destination, duration,
and route have been decided --and the navigation difficulty is determined
-- the player rolls her character's navigation skill to see how well she did.
Find the result points (the difference between the difficulty and the skill
total) and compare them to the accompany chart to decide what happens.
In this case, result points can be positive or negative.


In-System Travel and Combat
---------------------------

Starships move through space and battle other ships in much
the same way as planetary vehicles. Players can use standard vehicle
movement and character combat rules to determine the effectiveness
of one vessel attacking another.

Spaceships can have two additional systems worth mentioning:
shields and tractor beams.


### Shields ###

Ships can have two types of shields: passive and active. Passive 
shields including hull plating and some low-level energy shielding. 
They're good for warding off small asteroids and similar space debris, 
but they aren't effective against high-grade equipment. Active shields 
generally involve energy of some kind, and they create ﬁeld around the 
ship that absorbs or deﬂects harmful rays and objects.

Each starship has a shield die code, which the pilot splits among
four areas of an ellipsoid when he activates the shields. The four
areas are forward quarter, aft quarter, starboard quarter, port quarter.
The difficulty to deploy the shields depends on how many areas the
pilot wants to protect. Deploying shields counts as an action, but the
shield setting remains in effect until the pilot realigns them or they're
overloaded. (When splitting dice among areas, remember that there
are three pips in a die.)


### Overloading Shields ###

Shields that let pass through more than 3 times their current setting 
die code (not including pips) in damage are overloaded. They shut
down, and the pilot must restart them, which takes a round.


Tractor Beams
-------------

Resolve attempts to sling a tractor beam on another ship just
like any other attack. Then, roll the tractor beam's die code
against the target ship's hull Toughness. Should the tractor
beam's total be equal to or higher than the target's total, the
attacking ship has captured the target. Otherwise, the beam
was too weak to hold it.

The attacker may automatically reel in the captured ship,
assuming that the target doesn't attempt to resist on any round
before being brought into the hanger bay. (That means that,
if the attacking ship has no hanger bay to store the ship, the
target can continue to attempt an escape -- or at least until
the defender can move any more.)

If the target ship resists, roll the tractor beam's damage
against the target ship's hull Toughness. If the target ship's
Toughness roll is higher, it breaks free of the tractor beam. If
the tractor beam rolls equal to or higher than the target ship,
the target ship is reeled in and its drives may be damaged. Find
the results on the accompanying chart.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Tractor Beam ###

*Tractor Beam Roll ≥ Hull Roll By: Target's Max Move*

* 0-3: --
* 4-8: 1 level less
* 9-12: 2 levels less
* 13-15: 3 levels less
* 16+: Drives blown

Combat
======

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

This chapter provides an extended description of one of the most
rules-intensive aspects of roleplaying: combat.

When resolving a situation calls for force, time becomes broken into
rounds, which were discussed in the "Rounds and Initiative" section
of the "Game Basics" chapter. Within these rounds, three steps occur:
(1) generating initiative; (2) attacking and defending; (3) determining
damage; (4) repeating the steps, if necessary. Discover herein what
happens in each of those steps.


Step 1: Generating Initiative
-----------------------------

As discussed in the "Game Basics" chapter, determine initiative
based on the ﬁrst signiﬁcant action or on initiative rolls. Then go on
to Step 2.


Step 2: Attacking and Defending
-------------------------------

This is where the interesting stuff happens. The person whose turn
it is gets to decide what type of action her character is going to do.
Once she chooses, she makes a skill roll.

Note that a character need not attempt to engage in combat, but
this chapter only discusses what to do if the player decides to attack,
defend, or do both (typically with a multi-action penalty).


Base Combat Difﬁculty
---------------------

The base difficulty to attack someone is 10 (called the target's
passive defense value) or the target's active defense total, modiﬁed by
range and other factors.


### Active Defense ###

The target character can opt to use an "active defense," which
affects all attacks that occur after the defender's turn in the current
round but before the defender's turn the next round. Active defenses
are defensive maneuvers that the target consciously exercises, such as
dodging, blocking, or parrying. Each of these is represented by a skill
and counts as an action.

A character may make an active defense only when his turn comes up
in the initiative line, but the total for the roll is effective for all 
relevant attacks made against the character that occur after the 
character's currentturn but before his turn in the next round.

Remember: if a character acts later in a round than his attacker, he
cannot take his turn sooner and use an active defense to replace the
passive defense value -- his reactions just weren't fast enough.

If the roll is lower than the passive defense value, the character has
succeeded in making himself easier to hit -- by miscalculating where
the attack would be placed and actually getting in its way.

The active defense total is modiﬁed as the situation dictates.

**Dodge:** The character attempts to anticipate the ﬁnal location of
an attack from any source and be in another place when it comes. This
is done by rolling the dodge skill.

**Block/Parry:** The character attempts to stop his opponent's attack
by intercepting it and either stopping it with a block or deﬂecting it
with a parry. The character may roll his brawling or melee combat (if he
has something in his hands) to block it. If the character uses a sharp or
energized weapon (sword or dagger, for example) to parry an unarmed
blow and is successful at the block, the attacker takes damage from
the weapon. However, do not add the defender's Strength to the listed
weapon damage score when determining injuries inﬂicted this way.

If the opponent strikes at the character with a bladed or energized
hand weapon and the character uses any part of his body to intercept
the attack, the defender always takes the weapon's damage total. If
the block was successful, then the attacker's Strength Damage is not
added to the listed score. If the block was unsuccessful, then the target
character takes damage as normal. The character may avoid this aspect
by having armor, a special ability, or a suitable close combat 
specialization in melee parry.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Noncharacter Combat ###

When characters use exoskeletons or vehicles, the basic
combat rules are the same; the difference exists in which skill to
use. Vehicles, except exoskeletons, cannot block or parry. The
driver may only make defensive maneuvers appropriate for the
vehicle (generally "dodge"); he uses his exoskeleton operation,
piloting, or vehicle operation plus the vehicle's Maneuverability
rating to determine the new combat difficulty. Exoskeleton
(or mecha) operators may dodge, block, or parry, but these
all use the exoskeleton operation skill.

Similarly, when attacking with a vehicle- or exoskeletonmounted weapon, 
the character uses gunnery. Ramming or sideswiping with a vehicle 
requires the driver to make an appropriate vehicles roll. To punch, 
parry, or use a hand-held close combat weapon, an exoskeleton operator 
relies on his exoskeleton operation skill.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


### Full Defense ###

A character who foregoes all of her actions for a round to completely
protect herself from attacks makes a full defense. The total rolled by
the skill plus 10 takes the place of the base combat difficulty from the
time the character makes the full defense on her turn to her turn in
the next round.

Full active defense value = any active defense skill roll + 10


### Partial Defense ###

A character who chooses to do something else in addition to
guarding against attacks may take a partial defense. In this case, the
active defense roll replaces the base combat difficulty from the time the
character takes his turn in one round to his turn in the next round.

Partial active defense value = any active defense skill roll
Since the character is taking multiple actions, the multi-action
penalty applies.

The gamemaster may call for a partial defense roll (as a free action)
if he decides that the character might have a little awareness of an
impending attack, yet not enough foresight to prepare for it.


### Optional Passive Defense Modiﬁer ###

For every 2D in Agility or dodge above 4D (round up), a character
receives a +1 to her passive defense value. This modiﬁer does not affect
the character's active defense total. Every six ranks in a Skill Bonus or
Increased Attribute Special Ability that affects Agility or dodge provides
a +1 bonus, as speciﬁed for the skill in question.

Example: *A character with 4D in Agility gets no bonus, while a
character with 7D in acrobatics has a +2 bonus.*


### Combat Difﬁculty Modiﬁers ###

Here are a few of the most frequently used modiﬁers to the combat
difficulty. Others are discussed in "Combat Options" chapter. Regardless 
of the number of modiﬁers used, the total combat difficulty may
never go below 3.

The gamemaster rolls the indicated modiﬁer and adds it to the
combat situation. A standard modiﬁer is included in parentheses after
the die modiﬁer, should the gamemaster prefer not to roll.

**Range:** The effectiveness of a punch, weapon, Special Ability, or
any other attack made at a distance depends on its range. All range
modiﬁers are added or subtracted from the combat difficulty.

Note that, unless a special maneuver allows otherwise, characters
may use unarmed close combat attacks at Point Blank range only. In
most cases, this is true for using various melee weapons as well, though
the distance can be increased to Short range if the weapon is longer
than two meters. For instance, a character with a support beam can
whack an opponent at Point Blank or Short range.

**Cover:** When a target is protected by something -- poor lighting,
smoke, fog, a table -- it makes her harder to hit. This is represented
by a cover modiﬁer, which is added to the combat difficulty.

**Aiming:** Aiming involves careful tracking of the target. Characters
may perform it against moving targets, but they cannot themselves do
anything else in the round in which they aim. Each consecutive round
of uninterrupted aiming add 1D to the character's ﬁrearms, gunnery,
missile weapons, or throwing skill, up to a maximum bonus of +3D.


### Determining Success ###

Once the combat difficulty has been determined, the attacker rolls
the die code in his character's combat skill and compares the total to
the combat difficulty. If it equals or exceeds the combat difficulty, the
attack hits, probably doing damage or having another effect that the
attacker intended. If it was less than the combat difficulty, then the
attack misses.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Common Combat Difﬁculty Modiﬁers ###

*Range (Distance to Target): Modiﬁer*

Point Blank (0-3 meters): -5

Short (3 meters to ﬁrst value on range listing): 0

Medium (First to second value on ragnge listing): +5

Long (Second to third value on range listing): +10


### Estimating Ranges ###

Gamemasters who aren't interested in looking up weapon
ranges and ﬁguring out the distance to the target can estimate
what modiﬁers to use with these guidelines.

* A target within a few steps of the attacker is a Point Blank range.

* An attacker ﬁring a riﬂe at a target across a rather large
chamber shoots at Short range, while an attacker with a
handgun shoots the same target at Medium range.

* Most projectile combat taking place outdoors is at
Medium to Long range.


### Cover ###

*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Light smoke/fog: +1D (+3)
* Thick smoke/fog: +2D (+6)
* Very thick smoke/fog: +4D (+12)
* Poor light, twilight: +1D (+3)
* Moonlit night: +2D (+6)
* Complete darkness: +4D (+12)
* Object hides 25% of target: +1D (+3)
* Object hides 50% of target: +2D (+6)
* Object hides 75% of target: +4D (+12)
* Object hides 100% of target: --

Note: If cover offers protection, the attacker cannot hit the target
directly, but damage done to the cover might exceed the Armor
Value it provides, and, indirectly, damage the target. Most of
the time, the attacker must eliminate the cover before having a
chance to hit the target.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Step 3: Determining Damage
--------------------------

If a character successfully hits his target, he may have done damage
to it. To determine the amount of injury caused, roll the damage die
code for the weapon, including any modiﬁers from a special combat
action, such as a sweep attack or hit location. Some weapons list their
score as a die code with a plus sign ("+") in front of it; in this case,
add the damage die code to the attacker's Strength Damage die code,
add modiﬁers, and roll. If the gamemaster chooses to use the optional
damage bonus, this is added to the total at this time.

After the player or the gamemaster has ﬁgured out how much damage is 
done, go to the "Damage" chapter to determine how much of that damage 
the target sustained.


Determining Strength Damage
---------------------------

To ﬁgure the Strength Damage die code, drop the pips from the
character's Strength or lift die code (but include any relevant 
Disadvantages or Special Abilities), divide the number by 2, and round 
up. The Increased Attribute: Strength Special Ability affects the total.

Example: *A character with 3D in Strength has a Strength Damage
of 2D. A character with 6D+2 in lift has a Strength Damage of 3D.*


Optional Damage Bonus
---------------------

The combat skill roll is supposed to reﬂect the accuracy of an attack.
Therefore, gamemasters may reward high rolls for players' characters
and signiﬁcant gamemaster characters with a bonus to damage. Subtract
the difficulty of the successful attack from the skill total and divide
this number by 5, rounding up. Add this damage bonus to the damage
total before comparing it to the resistance total. If the gamemaster uses
the damage bonus in combination with a called-shot hit location, the 
bonus is in addition to the damage modiﬁer except for attempts on an 
arm, leg, or hand. In those cases, ignore the damage bonus. 

For Special Abilities and Metaphysics skills that require a combat 
roll to target them, the gamemaster may allow the combat roll's damage 
bonus to apply to the ability's damage total.


Step 4: Repeat
--------------

If the ﬁght isn't ﬁnished after one round, then return to Step 1 in the
"Combat" chapter and do it all over again. Repeat these steps until the 
ﬁght is resolved in favor of one side or the other.


Combat Summary
--------------

You can find a summary of the
information in this chapter on the
Reference Sheet included in the back
of this book.


Combat Example
--------------

To give you an idea of how all this works, here's a typical exchange
between a player's character and one of her opponents.
Gamemaster: Okay, we're in combat rounds now. Everyone make a
Perception roll. (All players and the gamemaster roll their dice.) Anyone
roll higher than 20?

Jesse: Yeah, I rolled a 23!

Gamemaster: All right, what do you want to do?

Jesse: Ah, that depends. What're the mercs doing?

Gamemaster: As one runs across the repair bay toward you, the
other two set up some kind of large, tripod-mounted weapon near the
entrance, which is about 15 meters away from you.

Jesse: I'm going to take two actions. First, I'll shoot at one of the mercs
with my laser riﬂe, and them I'm going to dodge out of the way.

Gamemaster: Okay, you lose 1D from each action and you don't
get the full defense bonus, since you're taking two actions.

Jesse: (Rolls his character's ﬁrearms dice.) I rolled a 6 on the Wild
Die! (Rolls the Wild Die again.) All right, that's a total of 21!

Gamemaster: Let's see... he's at Short range, so there's no modiﬁer
to the base combat difficulty of 10. You nailed him! Roll damage.

Jesse: (Rolls her riﬂe's damage dice.) I rolled an 18.

Gamemaster: (Using the Wounds system, he rolls the merc's
Strength to resist the damage.) Whoops! I rolled a 1 on the Wild Die.
That leaves a total of 2. Well, that's 16 points over the resistance total.
The optional damage bonus adds +2 and brings the total to 18. This
deﬁnitely puts him at the Dead level! Your riﬂe shot catches him right
in the chest and he's thrown backward into the wall. Okay, now make
your dodge roll. (Note that if the gamemaster had decided to use the Body
Points system, the merc would not have made a resistance roll, instead taking
the full 18 points of damage.)

Jesse: (Rolls his character's dodge dice.) Well, I rolled a 13, but
something tell's me that's not going to be high enough, so I'm going to
spend a Character Point.

Gamemaster: Okay, roll another die and add it.

Jesse: (Rolls one more die.) I rolled a 5, so that's a total of 18.
I'll stick with that.

Gamemaster: Okay, the mercs get to go now. The one rushing
toward you ﬁres his riﬂe. (Checks range and then rolls the merc's
ﬁrearms dice.) That's a 17.

Jesse: I rolled an 18 for my dodge this round. Good thing I
spent that Character Point!

Gamemaster: That's right, so the merc's blaster bolt lances
straight toward you and you just barely manage to jump out of the
way. On to the next one...


Damage
======

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

Injury can come from all sides. This chapter describes two methods
of ﬁguring out how hurt a character is, plus a few sources of damage
other than weapons.


Body Points versus Wound Levels
-------------------------------

The Body Points system has the advantage of a gradual fall into death
and a more rapid healing process. The Wound levels system brings it
on faster and is slower to heal. Which the gamemaster chooses to use
depends on how deadly he wants the game.

Furthermore, gamemasters should feel free further adjust the deadliness 
of their games by giving characters more or less Body Points or
Wound levels, by adding a modiﬁer to the damage resistance total, or
by adjusting the effects of each Wound level.


Damage and Body Points
----------------------

Once the player or gamemaster has her character's resistance total,
subtract the attacker's damage total from the target's damage resistance
total and subtract that number from the total Body Points the character 
has remaining. If the gamemaster chooses, she may compare the
number of Body Points the character has remaining to the "Wound
Level" table to determine what level of injury the defender sustained
and what its effects on the character are.

If the damage resistance total is greater than or equal to the damage
total, the defender incurs no injuries (beyond an annoying bruise, a
shallow scrape, a light burn, or dinged protective gear).


Damage Resistance Total
-----------------------

The damage resistance total equals a roll of the target character's
die codes from armor or Special Abilities (such as Attack Resistance)
minus any modiﬁers from disease, ingested poisons, or other 
debilitating circumstances (such as an appropriate Hindrance). A player 
may improve his character's resistance total by spending Character Points
or a Fate Point on this roll.

If the character has no armor or Special Abilities, then the character
has a damage resistance total of zero, and the player makes no roll.
However, they can still spend Character Points, using them as a base
damage resistance total. Spending a Fate Point allows the player to roll
his character's Strength. Totals determined from spending points are
adjusted as normal, including negative and positive damage resistance
modiﬁers.

### Damage and Gamemaster Characters ###

To reﬂect the average gamemaster's character's relative
unimportance to the universe, gamemasters may wish to
lower their Body Points or Wounds. For pure cannon fodder
any damage over a roll of their Strength might cause them
to keel over, while the main villain and her most important
lieutenants should get the full complement.

### Miscellaneous Damage ###

Here is a small selection of various other harmful things
that players may encounter during their adventures. Generally, 
no attack roll is necessary for any of these to affect a
character, though a such roll would be required if a person
could somehow attack with it. The gamemaster determines
what, if any, beneﬁt armor and similar protection provides.
Some equipment may even increase the damage! Damage is
otherwise determined as per the combat rules.

Except falling, all damage is done per round of close 
contact. The gamemaster may decide that certain types in 
certain situations also affect characters at a distance.

*Type: Damage*

* Botulism (severe case): 4D
* Cold (extreme): 1D
* Cyanide (fatal dose): 8D+2
* Electricity (standard wall outlet): 1D
* Electricity (major power line): 9D
* Falling (for fall of 3 meters or more): 1D per 1.5 meters
* Fire (torch-size): 1D
* Hydrochloric acid (undiluted, any amount): 2D+1
* Radiation (intense): 3D

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Stun Damage
-----------

For weapons that do stun damage, after the damage total is determined
but before applying it, subtract a roll of the target's Strength or stamina
from the damage total. If the victim suffers at least one point of damage,
that character goes unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the
difference between the resistance total and the original damage total.

Equipment that does stun damage only has no effect on inanimate, 
nonelectrical objects, though it does tend to disrupt electrical
components.


Damage and Wound Levels
-----------------------

Once the player or gamemaster has her character's resistance total,
compare the damage total to a resistance total on the "Wound Level"
table to determine how much injury the defender sustained and what
its effects on the character are.

If the damage resistance total is greater than or equal to the damage
total, the defender incurs no injuries (beyond an annoying bruise, a
shallow scrape, a light burn, or dinged protective gear).


Damage Resistance Total
-----------------------

The resistance total equals the target character's Strength plus any
bonuses from armor or Special Abilities (such as Increased Attribute:
Strength) minus any modiﬁers from disease, ingested poisons, or other
debilitating circumstances (such as Reduced Attribute: Strength or an
appropriate Hindrance). Do not include any Wound level modiﬁer
when attempting to resist damage. A character also may improve her
resistance by spending Character Points or a Fate Point on this roll.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Wound Levels ###

*Effect (Wounds = Damage Total ≥ Resistance Total By): Body Points Left*

* Stunned (1-3): 80% - 60%
* Wounded (4-8): 59% - 40%
* Severely Wounded (4-8 and already wounded): 39% - 20%
* Incapacitated (9-12): 19% - 10%
* Mortally Wounded (13-15): 1% - 9%
* Dead (16 or more): 0

Note: Any additional damage less than the character's current 
level moves the character up by one level.

This is an optional chart for those using Body Points. The "Body
Points Left" column is based on the character's maximum Body Points. 
Round so that there is no overlap between levels.

Penalties imposed by each level are not cumulative and they are not
included when determining the stun or damage resistance total or any 
total not involving a skill or attribute.

**Stunned:** Either receives -1D for all remaining actions this round and
next round or may only defend or retreat in the next round.

**Wounded:** -1D to all actions until healed.

**Severely Wounded:** -2D on all actions until healed.

**Incapacitated:** The character is severely injured. As a free action
before losing consciousness, he may try to stay up with a Moderate (15)
stamina or willpower roll. If the character succeeds, he may continue to
act, but all actions have a -3D penalty. If he fails, he is knocked out for
10D minutes.

**Mortally Wounded:** The character is near death and knocked
unconscious with no chance to keep up. Roll the character's Strength
each round, the character ﬁnally dies if the roll is less than the number
of minutes he's been at this level.

**Dead:** The character is toast. Sorry.

Fast Combat Option: Gamemasters who wish to give the players'
characters and their major opponents an edge in battles, make the
game more realistic, or simply save themselves trouble should apply the
modiﬁers in the ﬁrst round of combat and then reassess the levels after
combat is complete.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Stun Damage
-----------

For weapons that do stun damage, after the number of
Wounds have been determined but before applying the level
modiﬁers, reduce the weapon's damage by two Wound levels,
with a minimum level of Stunned. The character also goes
unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the difference
between the resistance total and the damage total.

Equipment that does stun damage only has no effect on
inanimate, nonelectrical objects, though it does tend to disrupt
electrical components.


Unconsciousness and Death
-------------------------

If the character's Body Points reach a few points or he has
attained the Mortally Wounded level but the character wasn't
instantly killed by massive damage, he is still gravely injured
and falls unconscious. Every round that the character is at this
level, his player makes a Strength roll against a difficulty equal
to the number of minutes the character has been Mortally
Wounded.

Sufficient medical aid to bring the character to at least 10%
of his maximum Body Points can possibly rescue the imperiled
character. If suitable medical aid is administered within four
minutes, the character recovers without undue harm. If the
medical aid is given within four to 10 minutes, the player rolls
his character's Strength or stamina against a difficulty equal to
the number of minutes he was Mortally Wounded. If the roll
succeeds, the character revives but he loses 1D from all of his
skills, though the skill cannot go below the attribute's die code.
If the medical aid is given within 10 to 15 minutes, the player
rolls his character's Strength or stamina against a difficulty equal
to the number of minutes he was Mortally Wounded. If the roll
succeeds, the character revives but he loses 2D from all of his
skills, though no skill can be reduced below the attribute's die
code. In any case, should the roll fail, the character dies.

Characters who receive their total Body Points in additional
damage after reaching zero Body Points cannot be revived (by
normal means, anyway).

Gamemasters who prefer a more rapid exit out of the
mortal coil may ignore these rules, instead declaring that once
the character reaches the Dead level or zero Body Points, the
character is history.


Descriptive Damage
------------------

So a character is down by a few Body Points or has a couple of
Wound levels -- so what? What does that mean in descriptive terms?
It depends on what caused the harm. The following list supplies some
general guidelines for describing what might have happened to the
character's body when he was hurt. Use the "Wound Levels" chart to
decide on the character's current Wound level.

**Stunned:** Moderate bruise or minor sprain; laceration; muscle tear;
minor dislocation of joint.

**Wounded:** Severe abrasion or sprain; deep laceration; torn ligaments; 
major dislocation or minor break.

**Severely Wounded:** Broken bone; gaping wound; ripped cartilage
and muscle; concussion.

**Incapacitated:** Multiple fracture; laceration in vital area; heavy
concussion.

**Mortally Wounded:** Above options combined with multiple
internal injuries.

**Dead:** Broken neck; punctured lung; eviscerated.

These are just a few examples. Really interested gamemasters can
come up with charts, tables, or detailed descriptions of damage for
those players who absolutely must know. The gamemaster may also
assign different modiﬁers than the general ones listed in the "Wound
Levels" sidebar that more appropriately indicate the type of injury
that was suffered.


Negative Damage Resistance Total
--------------------------------

It is possible for the damage resistance total to be a negative number.
Metaphysical feedback, Disadvantages, poisons, and sickness can all
contribute negative modiﬁers that might take the damage resistance
total below zero. In this case, the character's body is working against
him, compounding the additional damage done. Gamemasters have
three options for handling this: (1) They may use the negative damage
resistance total as a positive bonus to all difficulties until the character
is healed. (2) They may have the negative damage resistance total
add positively to the amount of injury caused. This is a good method
for simulating gritty adventures, as well as a way of getting low-level
gamemaster's characters out of the way. (3) Have the damage resistance
total equal zero. This last way works best for adventures of the comic
book or action ﬂick types.

### Adjusting the Deadliness ###

Changing the Body Points system is fairly obvious: More
Body Points lead to longer character life spans, while fewer
points bring about the end quicker. Altering the Wound level
system is a little more involved and can be handled in a few
different ways.

Gamemasters who want to add Wound levels may include
additional versions of the same level, similar to the way
Wounded and Severely Wounded are handled currently.
Alternatively, they may add additional levels between each
one by spreading out the points currently needed to reach
each level, or even add further point levels between Mortally
Wounded and Dead.

Gamemasters who wish to remove Wound levels may
include the lower limit of a deleted level in the next level
up or the upper limit in the next level down. Or they may
simply take levels out of the bottom and shift all remaining
levels down.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Massive Damage Option
---------------------

If a character incurs two Wound levels within a single round, not
only do the normal modiﬁers for the greatest level apply, the character
also can do nothing but defend or run away on the next two rounds.
In either of these rounds, the character may make an Easy stamina
or willpower attempt, as an action, to try to recover from the blow
and shake off the penalty. If this is declared as a multi-action for the
round, then the character takes the multi-action penalty. If not, and
the stamina or willpower roll is successful, the character may act as
normal in the next round.


Killing Blow Option
-------------------

An attack or series of attacks can cause enough injury that the
target may never recover from the harm except through metaphysical or 
other extraordinary or supernatural measures. Called a killing
blow, targets with Body Points must take a damage total equal to 91%
of the character's maximum Body Points in one blow or 100% of the
character's maximum Body Points in a single round. With Wound
Levels, the killing blow entails a Mortally Wounded result with one
blow or gaining the Dead level in a single round. In either case, use the
damage total after subtracting the damage resistance total to determine
whether the attack delivered a killing blow. When the target receives a
killing blow, he immediately dies.


Healing
=======

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

There are many different ways that characters can regain their health.
Characters may never get back more than their maximum number of
Body Points or Wounds.


Body Points
-----------

### Natural Healing ###

The body heals naturally during the course of the day. The more
rest characters get, the faster their wounds heal. Using the"Body Points
Healing" chart, the character rolls her Strength plus any appropriate
Special Abilities or Disadvantages and a modiﬁer based on how much
rest she's had that day. A character gets a modiﬁer of +1D on each full
day of rest (sleeping, reading, or other sedentary activities). If she is
involved in light activity, such as walking or singing, the modiﬁer is
zero. However, if most of the day is spent ﬁghting and running, the
modiﬁer is -1D. The character receives the Body Points back at the
beginning of the next day.

Optionally, the gamemaster may require an injured character to
complete a period of rest before making the natural healing roll. Use
the "Rest Period" chart and the character's Wound level to determine
how long the character needs to wait before attempting the natural
healing roll. The gamemaster then multiplies the result by 3 to ﬁgure
out how many Body Points were healed.


### Skill ###

Characters can heal others or themselves with some basic ﬁeld
procedures for treating wounds. Such attempts don't require a medical kit. 
Simply roll medicine to help an injured comrade, and ﬁnd the
results on the "Body Points Healing" chart. A successful roll heals the
character the listed amount. A character using a medical kit may add
its bonus to the roll.

A character may only attempt to heal a patient once per day. Other
characters may also try to help the patient, adding their expertise to
the ﬁrst healer's.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Body Points Healing ###

*Medicine or Strength Total: Body Points Recovered*

* 0: 0
* 1-5: 2
* 6-10: 1D
* 11-15: 2D
* 16-20: 3D
* 21-25: 4D
* 26-30: 5D
* 30+: 6D

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Wounds
------

### Natural Healing ###

A character can heal naturally, but this process is slow. The
character must rest a speciﬁed amount of time and then can make
a natural healing roll: roll the character's full Strength plus any
appropriate Special Abilities or Disadvantages. Then ﬁnd the result
on the chart related to the character's current Wound level to see
if the character heals.

Healing characters can do virtually nothing but rest. Characters
who try to work, exercise, or adventure must subtract 1D from their
Strength when they makes their natural healing roll. Any character
who opts to take it easy and do virtually nothing for twice the 
necessary time may add 1D to the Strength roll to heal.


### Skill ###

Characters can heal others or themselves with some basic ﬁeld
procedures for treating wounds. Such attempts don't require a medical 
kit. Simply roll medicine to treat wounds in the ﬁeld, and ﬁnd the
results on the Assisted Healing chart.

A successful roll heals the character up one level: for instance, a
successful medicine roll on someone who's Wounded would bring
him back to Stunned. A character using a medical kit may add its
bonus to the roll.

A character may only attempt to heal a patient once per day.
Other characters may also try to help the patient, adding their
expertise to the ﬁrst healer's.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Wounds Healing -- Natural ###

Stunned: A stunned wound is automatically recovered after one minute
(12 rounds) of complete rest.


*Wounded Strength Roll: Result*

* Critical Failure: Character worsens to Severely Wounded.
* 2-5: Character remains Wounded.
* 6+: Character is fully healed.


*Severely Wounded Strength Roll: Result*

* Critical Failure: Character worsens to Incapacitated.
* 2-5: Character remains Severely Wounded.
* 6+: Character improves to Wounded.


*Incapacitated Strength Roll: Result*

* Critical Failure: Character worsens to Mortally Wounded.
* 2-7: Character remains Incapacitated.
* 8+: Character improves to Severely Wounded.


*Mortally Wounded Strength Roll: Result*

* Critical Failure: Character dies.
* 2-7: Character remains Mortally Wounded.
* 8+: Character improves to Incapacitated.


### Wounds Healing -- Assisted ###

*Injury Level: Difficulty*

* Stunned, unconscious: Easy (10)
* Wounded, Severely Wounded: Moderate (15)
* Incapacitated: Difficult (20)
* Mortally Wounded: Very Difficult (25)


### Rest Period ###

*Level of Wound: Rest Period*

* Stunned (Those using Body Points should use this level
  for characters who have no Wound level.): 1 minute
* Wounded: 3 days
* Severely Wounded: 3 days
* Incapacitated: 2 weeks
* Mortally Wounded: 5 weeks


### Rest Period Example ###

A character at the Stunned Wound level may make a natural healing 
roll for Body Points or heal the Stunned level once she's rested for 
a minute. After recovering, should the character get to the Stunned 
level again, the character may make another natural healing attempt 
after the minute of rest. However, if the character moves to the
Wounded level, she may not make her natural healing roll until 
she's rested for three days.

Combat Options
==============

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

Players sometimes want their characters to do some pretty fancy
maneuvers during combat. This chapter offer guidance with several
common ones.


Using the Modiﬁers
------------------

All modiﬁers listed in this chapter and in the "Combat" chapter are
cumulative, though the gamemaster doesn't need to include all of them.
Modiﬁers may never adjust the total combat difficulty below 3.
The gamemaster rolls the indicated modiﬁer and adds it to the
combat situation. A standard modiﬁer is included in parentheses after
the die modiﬁer, should the gamemaster prefer not to roll.


Firearms Options
----------------

Burst Fire as Single: A character may perform this attack only with
a weapon capable of burst ﬁre (like an assault riﬂe) and switching to
single ﬁre. The ﬁrer ﬁres only one shot instead of a burst; it is primarily
used to conserve ammunition.

Full Auto: This attack is only possible with weapons that can ﬁre
at fully automatic settings (such as assault riﬂes, submachine guns, and
machine guns). Since the character takes time to"hold down the trigger"
and pump ammo into the air, the extra"to hit" and"damage" bonuses are
somewhat compensated for by the modiﬁer to the character's defensive
value during the round he is performing a full auto attack.

Single Fire as Multi: The character ﬁres a weapon several times in a
round at the same target. The most common example is when someone
ﬁres a pistol several times in a row at the same target. Characters may
use this option only when a weapon automatically reloads itself after
ﬁring a single shot or when it is fairly easy to ready it for ﬁring again
(such as a .45 automatic, which puts a new shell in the slide as soon
as the ﬁrst one clears the barrel). It increases the character's chance to
hit a target, as well as the damage. It does not count as a multi-action
as long as the shot is taken at the same target. One target, one die roll,
one damage total.

Sweep (Ranged): The character wants to"spray an area" with ammo.
Only characters with weapons that go full auto, burst, or single ﬁre
as multi (in general, just about any automatic weapon) can perform
this maneuver. The gun uses the amount of ammunition needed by
whichever setting is used. They gain a positive modiﬁer to hit (because
of the sheer volume of shots), but this "non-targeted" attack results in
a lower damage total.


Brawling/Melee Combat Options
-----------------------------

Acrobatic Tricks: Acrobatics can also enhance brawling and melee
combat attacks. The character must perform the acrobatics trick and
the attack on the same turn. The gamemaster determines the exact
difficulty of the acrobatics attempt. The player may add one-half of
the difference (rounded up) between the difficulty and the successful
acrobatics roll to the amount of damage done (not to the combat skill
roll). One acrobatics trick roll can affect one attack only.

All-out: The character attacks with no thought to the consequences.
This maneuver increases the chance of the character striking the target,
but, in that round, the attacker cannot perform any other action at all
-- not even to actively defend.

Lunge: The character takes a step forward to jab at an opponent,
usually with an edged weapon. This adds about a half-meter (more or
less depending on the stride) to the range of the attack, but it lowers
the effectiveness of the attack.

Knockdown/Push/Trip: Using brawling or a blunt melee weapon
in the usual way, the attacker causes his target to stumble and, instead
of taking damage, the opponent loses 2D from her next Agility or 
Agility-based skill roll. If this is a knockdown or trip attempt, she 
must also spend one action to stand up again. Generally, unless the 
character has special training, he may only knockdown or push a character 
whose Strength (including Special Abilities or Disadvantage modiﬁers) is
equal to or less than his own.

Sweep: These attacks, usually foot sweeps or roundhouses, are used
when the character wants to make certain she hits the target, regardless
of how much injury is caused.

Tackle: Tackling is much like grabbing, except that the attacker
seeks to overcome the target entirely. Characters may perform this with
brawling only. If successful or the target chooses not to struggle, the
character captures the target and may, if desired, do normal damage.
The target, meanwhile, may make no actions other than attempt to
escape (see the escape rules herein). On subsequent rounds, the attacker
may choose to do her Strength Damage only (no modiﬁers).

Grab: The attacker physically grasps a target. Few melee weapons
allow this option, so it is used generally only in brawling attacks. What
effect this has on the target depends on the type of grab. (The ones
listed here are choke, ﬂip, hold, slam/throw, and arm pin.) See the escape
rules in this chapter for details on getting out of grabs. On subsequent
rounds of a grab, the attacker may do his Strength Damage only (no
modiﬁers except those from Special Abilities or equipment) if he
defeats the victim's escape attempt or if the defender chooses not to
resist. Some grab variations may offer other options.

Choke: Ropes and hands can cut off the target's source of air. Damage
on the ﬁrst round equals the character's Strength Damage plus any 
modiﬁers. See the general grab rules for damage on subsequent rounds.

Flip: The character reaches out, grabs his opponent's wrist, arm, leg,
or similar body part, and jerks violently, causing the opponent to fall to
the ground. The opponent takes 3D in damage from slamming into the
ground and must spend the next round getting to her feet (if she can).

Hold: The character does less damage (-3D or more, at the player's
option, to the damage total), but she has hold of the target with a
successful attack.

Slam/Throw: The character grabs or picks up his opponent and
hurls him into the ground, a wall, a bus, or another obstacle. Lifting the
opponent counts as an action (using the lift skill), as does slamming or
throwing the target (which uses the throwing skill). The character must
be strong enough to pick his opponent up to use this maneuver.
Once slammed into an object, the target takes the damage score of
the object (usually determined by its Toughness, but the gamemaster
may adjust this) plus the attacker's Strength Damage. The object being
slammed into takes the Strength Damage of the opponent.

Arm Pin: The hero grabs his target's arm and forces it around
behind her, pinning it there. After the ﬁrst round, the player has
three choices as to what his character can do. Each option counts as
a separate action.

* Option 1: The character does his Strength Damage only for each
round he has the arm pinned.

* Option 2: The character tries to break the opponent's arm. The
attacker must make a successful Strength or lift roll versus a breaking
difficulty.

Against an opponent who does not resist, the difficulty equals 2
times the target's Strength or lift die code plus the pips plus any relevant
protection. Failing to beat the breaking difficulty in this case means
the target takes damage as in option 1.

Should the target chooses to resist, she may make no other action
in the round, but she may move her turn up. Instead, the player rolls
her character's Strength or lift and adds 5 and any relevant protection
to the total to generate the breaking difficulty. Failure by the attacker
to beat the breaking difficulty in this case means that the target escapes
and may freely take action on the next round.

* Option 3: The character may attempt to force the target to the
ground while maintaining his hold on the arm. The attacker rolls his
brawling against a submission difficulty.

If the opponent does not resist, the submission difficulty equals 2
times her Agility die code, dropping the pips. Failing to beat the breaking
difficulty in this case means the target takes damage as in option 1.

If the target chooses to resist, the opponent may make no other
action in the round, though she may move her turn up. Instead, the
player rolls her character's Agility and adds 5 and any relevant modiﬁers 
to the total to generate the submission difficulty. Failure by the
attacker to beat the difficulty in this case means that the target escapes
and may freely take action on the next round.


Additional Combat Options -- Called Shot
----------------------------------------

The character chooses a speciﬁc target, like a laster pistol in a bounty
hunter's hand, and aims for that. A called-shot modiﬁer represents
the difficulty of this (see the table on page 82), which is added to the
combat difficulty. On a successful attack, he knocks the item out of the
target's hand, grabs the limb, pins the target to a wall, or does +1D (or
more, at the gamemaster's discretion) to the damage. The exact result
depends on the situation and the player's intent.

Breaking Things
---------------

Use the demolitions skill guidelines in the"Example Skill Difficulties"
chapter for determining the effect of damage on items.


Disarm
------

If the disarm attempt is successful and the target character has not
made an action yet, she may move up her action to try and keep a grip
on the item she's holding. The defending character makes a Strength
or lift roll against the amount of damage done. If the defender's roll is
greater than the damage, the target character retains the item. If it is
less than or equal to the damage, she drops it.


Entangle
--------

A hero throws an entangling weapon at her opponent. On a successful 
ﬁrearms, missile weapons, or throwing roll (as appropriate), the
end of the weapon wraps itself around the target. Unless the weapon is
spiked, electriﬁed, or enhanced in some other way, it does no damage,
but it prevents the target from doing any action except for trying to
break free. The target may escape by snapping the bonds or slipping
free, each of which counts as an action. To break the weapon, he must
make a Strength or lift roll that meets or beats the damage total of the
weapon. To slip free, he needs to roll an Agility or acrobatics
total equal to or higher than the weapon's damage total.


Escape
------

To break free from any hold, the character must make
a successful opposed Strength or lift roll versus the holder's
Strength or lift. This counts as an action.


Group Attack
------------

This is a coordinated action. See the description of the
command skill in the next chapter for details.


Hit Locations
-------------

Hit locations are a special kind of called shot that allows
a character to shoot or strike a speciﬁc point on his target's
body. The table is used to determine the modiﬁers for hitting a 
target of Human proportions in different areas of
his body. Note that aiming at an arm or leg actually causes
less damage -- this is because the character took extra care
to shoot an area that is "less vital."


Knockout
--------

This option does only half of the normal damage, but
it can render the target immediately unconscious with a
successful attack. It requires a successful called shot to the
head. If, after the resistance total has been subtracted, the
target sustains at least two Wound levels or 50% of his
maximum Body Points in damage, then he falls unconscious for a 
number of hours equal to difference between
the combat skill total and the combat difficulty or until
he's awoken by some external force, whichever comes ﬁrst.
The target receives only half the Wound levels or Body Point 
damage inﬂicted (round down).


Multiple Weapons
----------------

Weapons that characters can use with one hand and in either hand,
such as knives or most guns, may be employed at the same time in the
same round. The character incurs a multi-action penalty.


Prone and Crouching
-------------------

Attacking a target that is crouched on the ground adds 1D (3) to
the combat difficulty. If the target is moving while crouching, then the
combat difficulty increases by +2D (+6), but the defending character's
normal Move, free Move, or running roll is halved.

For prone targets, subtract 2D (6) from the combat difficulty when
attacking at Point Blank or Short range, but add 2D (6) to combat
difficulty when attacking at Medium or Long range.

Characters who willingly get low to the ground or make themselves
small may get into and out of the position as a free action. However,
character forced into that position, such as a result of being thrown,
need to make an effort to stand, which counts as an action.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Hit Locations Modiﬁers ###

*Option: Difficulty Modiﬁer: Damage Modiﬁer*

* Head: +1D (+5): +12
* Heart: +4D (+15): +12
* Chest, abdomen: 0: 0
* Left or right arm: +1D (+5): -2
* Left or right leg: +1D (+5): -1
* Left or right hand: +4D (+15): -2


### Hit Locations Effects ###

At the gamemaster's discretion, sufficient damage to a particular hit 
location can affect the target's ability to use that part. Except for 
blows to the chest, the modiﬁer lasts until the character heals that 
portion (which typically takes a few days, as Body Points or Wounds 
are recovered for the body as a whole, not just a speciﬁc part). 
When the medicine skill or a healing effect is applied, it can be 
speciﬁed to repair one particular location.

Hit location modiﬁers are in addition to Wound level modiﬁers. If 
you are using them instead of the Wound level modiﬁers, then 
all -1 modiﬁers increase to -1D modiﬁers.

* Chest: The character can do no more than passively defend in the next
  round.
* Foot or leg: -1 to all acrobatics, sneak, movement, and initiative 
  totals.
* Hand or arm: -1 to all acrobatics, brawling, climb/jump, melee combat,
  missile weapons, sleight of hand, throwing, lift, and any other rolls 
  involving the hand or arm.
* Head: -1 to all Knowledge, Perception, and initiative totals.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Quick Draw
----------

This option allows the character to act rapidly or draw and ﬁre a weapon 
in the same round as one action. The character may use any combat skill 
or appropriate specialization. If she is also using a weapon, it must be 
suitable for quick drawing (a bow and arrow, a loaded pistol, a dagger, 
a shuriken).

Before initiative is rolled, the player must announce that she intends 
for her character to draw her weapon quickly. The player may then
take some of the skill dice and add them to the Perception die code for 
purposes of increasing initiative for that round only. The player must
leave at least 1D in her skill. If the character wants to make multiple 
attacks, she subtracts 1D for each attack beyond the ﬁrst from the
number of dice in the skill she's using before the player moves dice 
around. She does not take a penalty for the draw.

All attacks by the hero in the same round must be made with the same 
skill, though the results are determined differently and they all occur 
at the same die code because the multi-action penalty was already ﬁgured in.

Example: *Two mercenaries face each other in a stand-off. One of
the mercenaries has 4D in Perception and 8D in ﬁrearms. He may take
up to 7D and add it to his Perception die code to determine initiative.
The mercenary, however, wants to ﬁre twice. After subtracting 1D for
the extra attack, he now has 7D in the skill, which allows him to add
up to 6D to the initiative roll. He decides to move only 3D. This gives
him 7D in Perception to determine initiative and 4D in ﬁrearms. Now
both mercenaries make their initiative rolls.*

Once initiative is determined, at the character's turn in the round,
he uses the remaining dice in the skill to determine his accuracy.


Ready a Weapon
--------------

It takes one action per item to draw a gun, unsheathe a knife, reload
a riﬂe, or something similar. Although this generally does not require
a skill roll, the gamemaster may require one related to the weapon in
question for particularly stressful situations. Additionally, drawing and
using the weapon in the same round incurs a multi-action penalty. The
gamemaster may add further modiﬁers for attempting to get out an
item from a restrictive location or ready an unwieldy weapon.


Scale
-----

Occasionally, objects of vastly different sizes get involved in ﬁghts.
The scale modiﬁer accounts for the fact that bigger items are easier
to hit, and usually can take more damage, than smaller ones. Use the
accompanying chart as a guide for determining
the appropriate value for the two combat participants. Gamemasters 
may further subdivide between levels. 

If both opponents are either larger than or equal to a Human or 
smaller than or equal to a Human, subtract the larger number from 
the smaller one to calculate the scale modiﬁer. If one opponent is 
smaller than a Human while the other is larger, then add together 
the two values.

For most cases, use these rules: If the attacker is larger than the 
defender, then the scale modiﬁer is added to the combat difficulty
and the damage total. If the attacker is smaller than the defender, 
then the scale modiﬁer is added to the attacker's combat skill total 
and the defender's damage resistance total.

Example: *A smuggler has snuck into a warehouse guarded by miniature 
robots. The robots have a scale value of 6. With the smuggler's scale 
value of zero, the scale modiﬁer is 6 (6 - 0). Because the robot is 
smaller than the smuggler, the robot gets a +6 to its ﬁrearms roll, 
while the smuggler gets a +6 to her damage resistance total. When the 
smuggler attacks the robot, the scale modiﬁer is added to the 
smuggler's combat difficulty and to her damage total, if she 
manages to shoot it.

In some cases, the object may be large but lightly constructed (such
as a parade balloon). At these times, the gamemaster should not add
the scale modiﬁer to the damage resistance total.

Typically, a weapon's scale when determining how much damage it
does is the same as the person holding it or the thing it's mounted on.
So, a riﬂe has a scale value of 0, while a full-size tank's gun has a scale
of 10. These would differ if someone targeted just the weapon.

### Scale Chart ###

*Participant Size: Value*

* Small moon: 96
* Star freighter: 50

* Laser pistol: 9
* Palm computer: 12
* Cred-key: 15
* Computer chip: 21

Surprise
--------

A hero who surprises her opponent may either act ﬁrst in the round
(if initiative hasn't already been determined) or gain a +1D to her
action. Attacks from behind, an ambush, or unexpected sources (such
as a companion) make up the most common sources of surprise.


Unwieldy Weapon
---------------

Melee weapons longer than 60 centimeters, objects that are hard
to throw or grasp, ones relying on technology with which the user is
unfamiliar, or any weapons otherwise difficult to wield may incur a +5
or more modiﬁer to the combat difficulty. The gamemaster may decide
that such factors as experience, strength, and features of the weapon
(such as a well-balanced sword) lower this modiﬁer.


Example Skill Difﬁculties
=========================

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

The "Character Basics" chapter provided brief descriptions of each
skill (and you will need to return to that chapter if you need a refresher).
When the generic difficulties aren't enough, look up various skills in
this chapter to get even more ideas on the challenge level for using
those skills in common situations. Of course, not every possibility has
been covered, but this provides a terriﬁc foundation.


Using the Difﬁculties and Modiﬁers
----------------------------------

Unless otherwise stated, all listed modiﬁers are to the difficulty.
Modiﬁers may be cumulative, depending on the situation -- the tenser
they are, the more important the minutia become. The associated
attributed is listed after the skill name.


Metaphysics Skills
------------------

Descriptions and difficulties for Metaphysics skills are found in its
own chapter.

Combat Skills (Agility, Mechanical)
-----------------------------------

Skills covered: brawling, dodge, ﬁrearms, melee combat, missile
weapons, gunnery, throwing

See the "Combat" chapter for the difficulty to use combat
skills. For throwing, see also that skill's entry in this chapter.


Information Skills (Knowledge)
------------------------------

Skills covered: aliens, astrography, bureaucracy, business,
cultures, scholar, security regulations

The Knowledge attribute assists characters in ﬁnding out how
much they know about a certain ﬁeld, modiﬁed depending on the
situation. For this reason, one chart of general difficulties can serve
most uses of Knowledge, several Knowledge-based skills (see the
list), and investigation attempts involving researching a topic.

Gamemasters can employ the "Information Difficulties"
chart in one of two ways: by picking a difficulty based on what
the character seeks or wants to recall, or by comparing the skill
total rolled to the difficulties (whichever level the character meets or
beats is the amount and type of information collected or recollected).
Realize that the less well-deﬁned the skill is, the less information the
character knows or ﬁnds.

One high roll in any of these skills does not necessarily make the
character an expert in that ﬁeld. The roll represents only what the
character recalls at the time. A high roll could reveal a speciﬁc detail
of the information sought, as well as some hints for discovering more
of what the character seeks.

Characters may be assumed to have a general knowledge of their
home country, culture, and era, including basic geography, famous
people, and common etiquette.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

### Information Difﬁculties ###

*Amount of Information: Difficulty*

* Basic or common information; unconﬁrmed rumors: 5
* Theories; generalities: 10
* Complex concepts; moderately detailed information: 15
* Professional level; extensive (though not complete)
  information: 20
* Cutting-edge topics; extensive information, including 
  peripheral details and extrapolations: 30


*Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Age of information (per century in the past): +5
* Closely guarded secret: +15

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Interaction Skills (Perception, Knowledge)
------------------------------------------

Skills covered: con, intimidation, persuasion

Characters use con, intimidation, or persuasion skills to inﬂuence other
people that they meet. The typical difficulty is 10, modiﬁed based on the
dispositions of the characters involved, but a gamemaster may base it on
a skill roll. See the "Mental Defenses" sidebar for more information on
this; suggested difficulty modiﬁers are listed in their own sidebar.

Die rolls alone should not determine interactions between players'
and gamemaster's characters. Gamemasters should have their players
detail what their characters say and do to before rolling the dice. The
better the player acts the role of his character, the greater his chance
of success should be, which gamemasters can reﬂect by allowing up to
a +1D modiﬁer to the skill roll.

See also the individual entry in this chapter for con.


Using in Combat
---------------

Con, persuasion, and intimidation can enhance a character's attacks
and defenses. The player adds one-half of the difference (positive or
negative) between the difficulty and the con, intimidation, or persuasion
roll to any one attack or defense attempt (not both) made at Point
Blank or Short range. The character must use the beneﬁt from scaring
(intimidation), tricking (con), or seducing (persuasion) the target on the
same turn as or on the round after the interaction endeavor.

The user's appearance and demeanor can also affect persuasion, con,
or intimidation attempts. The more threatening the character looks or
seems, the less effective con and persuasion actions are, while 
intimidation attempts are more effective. Use the "Generic Modiﬁers" table 
in the "Game Basics" chapter to decide how much the appearance and
demeanor affect the target, if a Disadvantage or Special Ability doesn't
already provide one.


Interrogation Attempts
----------------------

Characters may use intimidation or persuasion to get information out of 
someone. Use the rules for mental defenses to determine the difficulty 
and base interaction modiﬁers. Further modify the number by how 
important the information is to the target. (See the accompanying 
chart for suggestions.) A separate intimidation roll to scare the 
target can complement an interrogation session.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

### Mental Defenses ###

In general, the resistance difficulty for many Metaphysics
or any interaction skill equals 10. The target cannot actively
resist unless he knows that a psychic or interaction skill is
being used on him by another character. If the gamemaster
decides that the target suspects but does not know for certain
that someone is attempting to inﬂuence him, the gamemaster
may allow the character to take an action earlier than his turn
in the round and roll his willpower or Knowledge to generate
a new resistance difficulty. Should the character decide to
actively defend against mental intrusion or personal interaction, 
he may devote all of his actions for the round to that task
and roll his willpower or Knowledge, adding +10 to the score
to get the new resistance difficulty. However the interaction
resistance difficulty is determined, gamemasters may further
modify the number as the situation warrants (such as stress,
surprise, or character relationship).


### Interaction Modiﬁers ###

*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Target is friendly or trusting: -5
* Target is neutral toward character or of equal standing: 0
* Target is hostile or has superior standing: +5
* Target is an enemy: +10
* Target is in weakened position: -10
* Request is something target would do anyway or target feels is 
  of minor importance: 0
* Request is illegal or highly dangerous: +10
* Target is on guard or actively resisting (Do not include this 
  modiﬁer if you are using the active mental defense described 
  in the "Mental Defenses" sidebar.): +10


### Interrogation Modiﬁers ###

*Target: Modiﬁer*

* Feels information is unimportant: -10
* Feels information is of minor importance: 0 
* Feels information is important: +5
* Feels information is very important: +10
* Would rather die than reveal information: +10 or more

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Observation Skills (Perception, Mechanical)
-------------------------------------------

Skills covered: search, comm, sensors

Gamemasters can rely on the "Observation Difficulties" chart on
the next page for situations involving the gathering of information.
They can be used as difficulties to beat or as a means of reading the
results of a dice toss.

To see if a character notices details of a scene or situation, the
gamemaster may have the player make a Perception roll. Unless the
characters are actively eavesdropping, searching, tracking, or performing
a similar activity (and thus using the search skill), this passive 
observance of a scene does not count as an action. Use the "Observation
Difficulties" chart as a guideline for how much the character notices.
If the skill total meets or beats the difficulty, the character gains that
much information.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

### Observation Difﬁculties ###

*Situation: Difficulty*

* Noticing obvious, generic facts; casual glance: 5
* Noticing obvious details (ex. number of people): 10
* Noticing a few less obvious details (ex. gist of conversation): 15
* Spotting a few speciﬁc details (ex. identities of individuals): 20
* Spotting a few obscure details (ex. speciﬁcs of conversation): 25
* Noticing many obscure details: 30 or more

Repair Skills (Technical)
-------------------------

Skills covered: armor repair, computer interface/repair, exoskeleton 
repair, ﬁrearms repair, ﬂight systems repair, gunnery repair,
personal equipment repair, robot interface/repair, vehicle repair

Though there are many different kinds of repair skills, they all
follow the same principles. The base difficulty to ﬁx or modify
anything is 10. The amount of damage sustained, the character's
familiarity with the item, availability of parts, and complexity of the
task can modify the difficulty. The gamemaster may require a separate
roll to determine whether the character can ﬁgure out how to repair
an unknown item. Destroyed parts must be replaced, which raises the
difficulty. Additionally, if a hero rushes the job, not only is there an
increased chance of failure, but the item could also break again soon
after its next use.

See also the computer interface/repair and robot interface/repair
entries in this chapter and the "Cybernetics" chapter for details on
installing cybernetics with personal equipment repair.


*Situation: Modiﬁer*
                                          
* Light repairs or modiﬁcations: 0
* Heavy repairs or modiﬁcations: +5
* Extensive repairs or modiﬁcations: +10 or more
* Previously built or modified the item; intimately familiar 
  with item: -10
* Has item's designs: -5
* Common item: 0
* Has seen but not used item: +5
* Has never seen item: +10
* All parts available: 0
* Some parts available: +10
* No parts available: +20
* Correct tools (Tool kits might provide their own bonuses): 0
* Makeshift tools: +15


Aliens, Astrography, Bureaucracy, Business, Cultures, Scholar, Security Regulations (Knowledge)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See"Information Skills" in this chapter for difficulties and modiﬁers
related to using these skills.


Exoskeleton Operation, Vehicle Operation (Mechanical)
-----------------------------------------------------

See the"Vehicles and Aerial Characters" section in the "Movement" chapter
for details on using these skills.


Flying/0-G, Running (Agility), Swim (Strength)
----------------------------------------------

Difficulties for these skills are included in the Movement chapter.


Hide, Sneak (Perception)
------------------------

The difficulty for a hide or sneak attempt is usually the opponent's
Perception or search, either as a die roll (if the opponent is actively 
trying to ﬁnd the object or person) or as a derived value equal to 
the number in front of the "D" in the opponent's attribute or skill 
times 2 and add the pips.


*Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Heavy rain or snow: -3
* Dawn, dusk, fog, many trees, large crowd, etc.: -2
* Night: -5
* Inattentive observer: -5
* Dense concealment (thick jungle, crowd of people in costume): -5
* Many distractions (party, parade, combat): -5
* Attentive observer: +6
* Open terrain: +6
* Good lighting: +6
* Several observers +9


Acrobatics (Agility)
--------------------

Using acrobatics can also improve many of a character's climb/jump
and running attempts. The gamemaster determines the difficulty of the
acrobatics stunt. One-half of the difference (rounded up) between the
difficulty and the acrobatics roll is added to the complementary skill.
The acrobatics attempt and the climb/jump or running try must be
done on the same turn, incurring a multi-action penalty.

Instead of adding a modiﬁer to the running or swim difficulty for
particularly challenging obstacle courses, the gamemaster may have the
hero make an acrobatics roll in addition to a running or swim roll.

Acrobatics can make a character appear more intimidating. The
player may add one-half of the difference (rounded up) between the
difficulty and the successful acrobatics roll to her intimidation attempt.
The intimidating attempt may be made on the same turn as the acrobatics 
roll or on the next round.

During a fall, acrobatics may be used to reduce bodily harm. If the
character has not already used his turn for the round, he may rely on
acrobatics in an attempt to land properly. The character generates an
acrobatics total. For every ﬁve points over the base difficulty number
of 10, the hero reduces the damage total by one point, in addition to
a base reduction of one point. The damage total, however, cannot be
lower than zero.


*Maneuver: Difficulty*

* Somersault; pirouette: 5
* Handspring; cartwheel; handstand 10
* Swing over a obstacle: 10
* Round-off; backﬂip: 15
* Vaulting over an obstacle: 15
* Bouncing off a surface to reach a speciﬁc destination: 20
* Walking up a wall (*The character may "walk" a maximum of 
  her Move in one round; she must have a ﬂat surface to stop 
  on at the end of her turn or she falls and takes damage from 
  the fall.): 30


*Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Flat surface to ﬂat surface: 0
* Unlimited landing area: -3
* Limited landing area: +3
* Almost no landing area: +6
* Rough or unsteady landing area: +3 or more
* High surface to low surface: +3
* Low surface to high surface: +6
* Slippery surface: +3
* Strong wind: +3
* Add a twist of the body (per twist): +3
* Performing the maneuver underwater or backwards: +3
* Performing the maneuver in the air (such as on a trapeze or bars): +9
* Performing the maneuver on a narrow surface: +6

Note: Characters may combine one or more maneuvers in the same
action. In this case, use the difficulty of the most challenging maneuver,
add 3 for each additional maneuver (up to ﬁve additional maneuvers),
and include modiﬁers as if the complex stunt was one maneuver.

Acrobatics can also aid a character in escaping from bonds. The chart
below contains sample difficulty numbers for escaping from various
kinds of restraints. Modify the difficulty based on the circumstances of
the escape, such as the conditions the character works under or specially
designed restraints. The character may not use this skill if completely
immobilized. If in multiple restraints, the character must make a separate
roll for each one. A Critical Failure indicates that the character has pulled
a muscle (and he does his Strength Damage to himself ).

Note that this skill does not substitute for the sleight of hand skill.
The character may be able to pull his arms over his head to use his
hands, but he may not be able to slip out of the handcuffs unless they
are improperly secured.


*Sample Restraints: Difficulty*

* Ropes: 13
* Wires, chain: 15
* Handcuffs: 16
* Straitjacket: 18


Artist (Perception)
-------------------

The time needed to perform the artist skill varies, depending on the
quality and complexity of a piece. A simple amateur piece may only
take a few minutes, while a complex, prize-winning endeavor could
require weeks or months. Characters may also use this skill to judge
works of art created by others and possibly as a complementary skill
to forgery to detect fake artistic pieces. The higher the total is above
the creation total for the piece, the more information the judge knows
about it (such as ﬂaws, alterations, its creator, and the like).


*Quality of Piece: Difficulty*

* Amateur: 9
* Professional: 15
* Emotionally moving: 18
* Prize-winning: 24

*Complexity of Piece: Modiﬁer*

* Simple; has one or two parts: -5
* Moderate; has a few parts: 0
* Complex; has many parts: +10


Bargain (Perception)
--------------------

Characters use this skill to haggle over prices. The gamemaster
should use a mixture of roleplaying and die rolls to determine how the
character is doing at acquiring selling the desired goods or services.

The player always has the choice to refuse a deal. Similarly, if the
gamemaster feels that the character's roll represents an unfair deal,
without the player embellishing by roleplaying the situation, he should
allow the gamemaster's character to refuse the deal as well.

To resolve the haggling, either make an opposed skill roll using
any modiﬁers appropriate or select an appropriate standard difficulty
number. Subtract the seller's total from the buyer's total and look up the
number on the chart below. Multiply the price of the item (as credits
or a number) by the percentage given to get its ﬁnal cost. Be certain to
include any price modiﬁers (as suggested in the "Equipment" chapter)
before making the adjustment. If using Funds, this becomes the new
number the Funds roll must meet or exceed.


*Difference : Price Adjustment*

* -21 or more: 300% of local market value
* -16-20: 200% of local market value
* -11-15: 150% of local market value
* -6-10: 125% of local market value
* -3-5: 110% of local market value
* -2 to +2: At local market value
* +3-5: 90% of local market value
* +6-10: 85% of local market value
* +11-15: 75% of local market value
* +16-20: 65% of local market value
* +21 or more: 50% of local market value

Characters can also employ bargain to"pay" another person to behave
dishonorably, such as through ignoring duty, looking the other way, or
divulging secret information. Success depends greatly on the target.
A target who is loyal or wealthy or fears being caught is less likely to
accept bribes. Use the difficulties listed under "Interaction Skills" and
further modiﬁed by such factors as the value of the money, goods, or
information offered, the extent of favors given and received, and the
target's attitude toward the bribe.


*Value of Bribe: Modiﬁer*

* Less than 50% of what is reasonable: +10
* 50% to 90% of what is reasonable: +5
* Larger than expected: -5
* Signiﬁcantly larger than expected:  -10


Climb/Jump (Strength)
---------------------

Base difficulties for uses of this skill are included in the"Movement"
chapter. Note that taking care in climbing and carrying 50% or more
of the character's body weight slows the character down by two meters
or more per round.


*Climb Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Taking care in climbing: -5
* Less than a 90-degree angle: -3
* Less than a 60-degree angle: -6
* Less than a 45-degree angle: -9
* Prepared for climbing: -6
* Carrying 25% of body weight: +3
* Carrying 50% of body weight: +6
* Carrying 100% of body weight: +15
* Many handholds: -10


*Jump Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Flat surface to ﬂat surface: 0
* Unlimited landing area:-5
* Limited landing area:+5
* Almost no landing area:+10
* Rough, slick, or unsteady landing area:+3 or more
* Uphill (more than 30 degrees): +6
* Carrying 50% of own weight:+6
* Carrying 75% of own weight:+9
* Carrying 100% of own weight: +12


Command (Perception)
--------------------

Command governs the act of convincing individuals to comply with speciﬁc 
directions, as well as maintaining morale during group undertakings 
(such as combat or building large pieces of equipment). This skill is
typically used only with the gamemaster's characters, though sometimes
it may be attempted with players' characters (such situations should be
roleplayed ﬁrst, with a bonus or penalty to the command roll based on
how well the group participated in the activity together). A high command
roll can complement individual participants' rolls in a group activity, while
a low command roll can impose negative modiﬁers. It generally requires
at least one round of planning to perform effectively.

Characters can use this skill to combine their attacks. One person is
designated the leader and makes the command roll. If successful, everyone
goes on the leader's initiative. Participants make their attacks with the hit
location modiﬁer (to reﬂect that they're aiming for a designated location),
but the target resists the combined total of all damage done it. If the
command roll fails, determine initiative and actions individually.


*Complexity: Difficulty*

* Uncomplicated; imprecise: 3
* Easy; minimal precision required: 7
* Requires effort or precision: 12
* Difficult; requires high degree of precision: 17
* Requires much effort or extreme precision: 22
* Requires care and thoughtfulness, or exacting precision: 28


*Team: Modiﬁer*

* All members willing to follow leader's orders no matter what: -20
* All members willing to sacriﬁce life for others: -15
* Trained together frequently to work as unit: -10
* Trained together brieﬂy to work as unit: -5
* Work together regularly, or willing to work together: 0
* Worked together on a few occasions: +5
* Seldom work together: +10
* Never worked together before, or more than half of the members hate 
  each other: +15
* No interest in working together, all members despise each other, or 
  members can't communicate with each other: +20


Computer Interface/Repair (Technical)
-------------------------------------

The base difficulty is 10.

*Computer Use Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Open-access personal computer or mainframe: 0
* Networked computer: 0
* Isolated computer: +3
* Accessible by a few people: +3
* Accessible by owner only: +6
* Password protected: +3
* Firewall protection: +6
* Files encrypted: +3 or more


*Programming Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Simple programming language: 0
* Complex programming language: +3
* Encrypting program: +6
* Program designed to accomplish multiple tasks (per task): +3
* Designed to work on multiple operating systems (per additional 
  system): +6


*Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Character unfamiliar with the program's language: +3
* Character experienced with the program's language: -3


Con (Perception)
----------------

In addition to tricking people verbally, a character can use con to
change his appearance. The character's skill total in creating the disguise
serves two related purposes. First, the higher the roll, the less likely
an observer will question the disguise. Second, the total becomes the
difficulty number for Perception or investigation efforts to see through
it. If the investigation check is higher than the con total, the disguise
has been penetrated.

If at any time while the character is disguised he performs an
action inconsistent with the disguise, any observer has a chance to
see through it.

Although one character may use con to alter the features of another
character, the disguised character must actively work at keeping up the
disguise using her own con skill or Perception.

*Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Speciﬁc person: +15
* Other sex: +6
* Different race or species: +3
* Great age difference: +3
* Much larger build: +5
* Much smaller build: +10
* Resembles the disguise already: -5
* Using skill on another character: +6
* Using skill unaided: +3


Demolitions (Technical)
-----------------------

The base difficulty is 5. For extra damage and special effects, the
character must spend one round per difficulty number setting up the
explosives. The character also needs to indicate how much explosive
she's using. If the attempt is successful, compare the skill total with
the object's damage resistance total (its Toughness modiﬁed by size,
thickness, ﬂaws, supports, etc.). Items that take at least 10 points above
their damage resistance total are severely damaged, if not destroyed.
Items taking less than that are weakened, and another attempt may be
made (with the object having a reduced damage resistance total and
possibly other problems).

Remember that, while a character may think an object is constructed
of one type of material, it may not be. Though this does not alter the
difficulty of setting the explosive, it may change the results of special
effects. For instance, an explosive set for thin wood won't do much
good if that's only veneer for reinforced steel.

*Example Result: Modiﬁer*
* Rigging a bomb so a car explodes the next time it starts: 0
* Blowing something open without leaving permanent marks or burns: +5
* Rigging an explosion so its force goes in a speciﬁc direction: +10
* Rigging an explosion so that only a certain, small piece of a much 
  larger object is damaged: +15
* Extra damage: +5 per +1D


*Familiarity with Target: Modiﬁer*

* Very familiar or common (tree, wall): 0
* Familiar (bulkhead, bridge support): +5
* Unfamiliar (building of unknown construction): +10
* Completely unknown item or construction: +20 or more


*Object Construction : Toughness*

* Flimsy (plywood door): 1D
* Tough (hard wooden door, most guns): 2D
* Sturdy (bolted steel door, personal safe): 3D
* Very sturdy (a few layers of steel): 4D
* Reinforced (numerous layers of steel): 6D


Forgery (Perception)
--------------------

The artist skill may complement this skill, or the gamemaster may
require it to be used instead, with the appropriate forgery modiﬁers applied.
Reduce the amount of time spent on creating a forgery if the character
has repeatedly succeeded at making similar items in the past.


*Item Forged: Difficulty*

* Unofficial note or correspondence (Time required: 10 minutes or 
  more): 6
* Signature (Time required: 5 minutes): 12
* Official document (pilot's license, legal tender) (Time 
  required: 20 minutes or more): 18


*Familiarity with Item: Modiﬁer*

* Intimately familiar or has sample: -10
* Somewhat familiar; has seen it quite often: -5
* Passingly familiar: 0
* Have only had it described: +5
* Guessing blindly: +15


*Tools: Modiﬁer*

* Have necessary tools and some special ones: -5
* Have necessary tools:  0
* Have some tools: +5
* Missing important tools: +10 or more


*Forgery Inspector -- Familiarity with Item Forged: Difficulty*

* Intimately familiar: 6
* Moderately familiar: 12
* Unfamiliar: 18
* Completely unfamiliar: 24


*Forgery Inspector -- Situation: Modiﬁer

* Have sample: -5
* Have special tools for detecting forgeries: -5
* Item poorly forged: 0
* Item well forged: +5
* Item superiorly forged: +10

Note: The gamemaster may add the number of points above the forging 
difﬁculty to the inspector's difficulty instead of using one of these 
modiﬁers.


Gambling (Perception)
---------------------

Gambling doesn't affect games that are purely random, but does 
inﬂuence games with an element of strategy, like poker. All characters
make opposed gambling rolls, without spending Character or Fate Points, 
and the highest roll wins. A character may cheat by using Character
or Fate Points on the roll, and the gamemaster may give bonuses to 
rolls for people looking for a cheater or helping the cheater. The 
gamemaster should consider as many "angles" as possible when using the 
gambling skill, and add these as modiﬁers to one or more participants' 
rolls.


Investigation (Perception)
--------------------------


When used to research a topic, a separate roll must be made for each 
source checked.


*Research Situation: Difficulty*

* Common knowledge: 7
* Requires searching through several sources; introductory theories: 12
* Sources are of varying reliability; cutting-edge information; speciﬁc 
  information about harmless individual or event: 18
* Esoteric information; speciﬁc information about dangerous individual 
  or event: 24


*Condition: Modifier*

* Information closely guarded: +5
* Character unsure of information sought: +5
* Character knows exactly what information is sought: -5

When used to ﬁgure out clues from a scene, the base difficulty 
is 10. The character must use search ﬁrst to ﬁnd the clues or evidence
(or have them pointed out); investigation helps the character ﬁgure
out what they mean.


*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Information about subject/event is sketchy: +15
* Information about subject/event is extensive: -15
* Evidence is fairly clear; many clues; familiar objects with 
  expected use:-6 or more
* Evidence is only partly clear; several clues; familiar objects 
  with uncommon use, or unfamiliar objects with common use: 0
* Evidence is obscure; few clues: +3
* Evidence is unusual or with no apparent signiﬁcance; uncommon 
  objects with uncommon use: +6
* Repeatedly commits similar crimes (per crime): -3
* Distance between crimes (per 80 kilometers): +3
* Time between crimes (per 6 months): +3 (up to a maximum of +30)


*Roll > Difficulty: Result*

* 0-2: Basic information about the situation (a rope was used, type 
  of weapon).
* 3-6: Precise information about situation (probable manufacturing 
  origin of evidence, small details about items in room).
* 7-11: Previous results plus how all items in an area were put to use. 
* 12+: Reconstruction of events from the evidence.


Know-how (Perception)
---------------------

To use this skill to help with an activity
covered by another skill (which the character does not have), the
character spends the round before examining the situation, performing
no other actions, and making a roll of this skill versus the difficulty
set for the action. The character gets neither the unskilled modiﬁer
nor the preparing modiﬁer. Within the next 30 seconds (six rounds),
the character may add the difference between the difficulty and the
know-how skill roll to total roll for the attribute dictated by the actual
skill required. The character may not use this skill in place of a skill
she already has. The gamemaster may limit the number of times per
hour this skill may be used on the same action.


Languages (Knowledge)
---------------------

First, determine what the character wants to express or understand
and how closely the language in which she wants to express it is to her
native tongue. Then, compare the difference between the skill roll and
the difficulty to decide how close she came. Characters with a 
specialization in the language they are using who succeed at the skill 
roll receive a +3 bonus to determining the comprehension level.


*Situation: Difficulty*

* Idea is very simple, consisting of a short phrase: 3
* Idea is simple; no slang; children's book: 7
* Idea is of average complexity; most adult nonﬁction: 12
* Idea is complex; slang involved; most adult ﬁction:18
* Idea is very complex; technical jargon involved; academic writing: 24


*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* One or two common, basic words: -5
* Has a translating aid (book, computer program, electronic pocket 
  device, hand signals -- Note that translation aids might provide 
  their own bonuses, which are used instead of this.): -5
* Different dialect of own language: 0
* Language is derived from common root language (ex., understanding 
  Spanish if you understand French): +5
* Completely foreign language (ex., Chinese has nothing in common 
  with English): +10
* Obscure language; reading lips: +15
* Language is unique to an uncontacted culture, from a dead culture, 
  or unpronounceable by the character trying to understand: +20
* Language includes many concepts nearly beyond the character's 
  understanding or experience: +25


*Roll > Difficulty: Comprehension Level*

* 0-2: Gist of idea; most words understood or conveyed properly; word 
  usage seems stilted
* 3-6: Literal translation; slang expressed/translated incorrectly
* 7+: Subtle connotations


Lift (Strength)
---------------

At the gamemaster's discretion, a player may make a lift check
when his character ﬁrst picks up an object. (Generally, if the object's
weight would give it a difficulty equal to or greater than one-half of
the character's lift, rounded up, or the object is being lifted hastily or
under stress, the gamemaster should require a lift roll.)
For each round the object is carried, the character makes another
check to see if she can continue to carry the object. If the player fails the
roll, her character is too exhausted and must put the object down. If the
character is doing anything else at the time (other than walking slowly
or talking), continuing to carry the object counts as a multi- action.


### Abridged Lift Table ###

*Weight: Difficulty*

* 1 kg: 1
* 10 kg: 3
* 50 kg: 7
* 100 kg: 12
* 120 kg: 13
* 200 kg: 17
* 250 kg: 18
* 500 kg: 23
* 750 kg: 28
* 1000 kg (1 ton): 33
* 1100-2000 kg: 34-43 (+1 to base of 33 per 100 kg over 1000 kg)
* 2500-10,000 kg: 44-59 (+1 to base of 43 per 500 kg over 2000 kg)
* 15,000-100,000 kg: 60-77 (+1 per to base of 59 per 5000 kg over 10,000 kg)

The gamemaster may further subdivide the lift chart if desired to
include the weights for the difficulties not listed here.


### Lift Fatigue Modiﬁer ###

*Time: Skill Modiﬁer*

* 1-6 rounds: 0
* 7 rounds to 3 minutes: -5
* 3-10 minutes: -10
* 10-30 minutes: -15
* 30-60 minutes: -20

Note: After the ﬁrst hour, the character must make a check once per
hour at the same difficulty as one hour. If the character fails the roll,
then she must rest for twice as long as she was lifting the weight.


Medicine (Technical)
--------------------

For game mechanics on using medicine to heal damage, see the end
of the "Healing" chapter.


*Medicine Diagnosing Action: Difficulty*

* Determine existence of disease or injury (Time required: 1 round): 7
* Determine toxicity of substance (Time required: 1 minute): 7
* Determine type of disease, toxin, or injury (Time required: 1 
  minute): 12
* Determine medicine, procedure, or antidote required (Time 
  required: 1 round to 1 hour): 18
* Determine cause (Time required: 1 day to 1 week): 24


Navigation (Mechanical)
-----------------------

The base difficulty for a character to ﬁnd his way around a planet
is 10. See the "Space Travel" chapter for information on how to get
around the universe without getting lost (or too lost).


*Planetary Situation: Modiﬁer*

* No idea which way is north: +10
* General idea which way is north: 0
* Familiar with terrain: 0
* Terrain completely foreign: +5
* Completely lost: +10
* Have a compass or similar navigational tools: -5
* Plotting a simple course: 0
* Plotting a complex course: +6
* Plotting a dangerous course: +9
* Determine exact location: +15


*Condition: Skill Modiﬁer*

* Have a poorly drawn map: +1D
* Have a sketchy but accurate map: +2D
* Have a well-drawn map: +3D
* Have a misleading or purposely inaccurate map (and don't know it): -1D


Piloting (Mechanical)
---------------------

See the"Movement" (speciﬁcally the"Vehicles and Aerial Characters"
section) and "Space Travel" chapters for details on using this skill.

Riding (Agility)

When a character ﬁrst mounts a ridable animal, she must make a riding
roll against the creature's willpower roll (the gamemaster generates this).
The character's riding total may be modiﬁed by the attitude of the animal
toward the character. The character stays in control if she ties or beats
the beast's roll. If she fails, consult the table below for what occurs.

When attempting to get the beast to perform a special maneuver or
during events that might frighten it, the character must also roll against
the animal's Knowledge or willpower. Examples of special maneuvers
include jumping a fence, crossing a raging river, moving faster, or 
slowing down quickly. (The success of special maneuvers are determined
with the animal's attributes or skills.)

A character attacking from the back of a beast takes a multi-action
penalty for having to both control the mount and use a weapon.


*Animal's Attitude toward Character: Skill Modiﬁer*

* Friendly or trusting: +5
* Neutral: 0
* Hostile or wounded: -5


*Willpower > Riding: Result*

* 1-2: Beast stops and refuses to move for 1 round.
* 3-6: Beast stops and refuses to move for 2 rounds.
* 7-11: Beast bolts in a random direction for 1D rounds.
* 12+: Beast bucks rider; rider must make a Moderate riding roll to 
  avoid being thrown off.


Robot Interface/Repair (Technical)
----------------------------------

Most robots do not have attributes, though sophisticated ones might.
Instead, skills and their specializations represent the tasks a robot can
perform. The programmer must have a means of inputting information
into the robot, such as a computer terminal or hand computer. The
time taken depends upon the complexity of the task -- a Very Easy (5)
program might take only half an hour to program, but a Very 
Difficult (25) one might take days or weeks to program.

Once the robot has the basic skill, skill cartridges, scholarchips, or
additional programming can upgrade it.


*Program: Difficulty*

* Specialization of a skill (ﬁrst 1D): 5
* Additional +1 pip in previously programmed specialization: 10
* Full skill (ﬁrst 1D): 15
* Additional +1 pip in previously programmed skill: 5
* An attribute (ﬁrst 1D): 25
* Additional +1 pip in previously programmed attribute: 15
* Reformatting main memory (not hardwired memory): 15


*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Each additional pip of skill, specialization, or attribute programmed 
  at same time: +2
* Hardwired program (cannot be deleted by reformatting): +30
* Reprogramming hardwired programs: +30
* Unfamiliar with robot type: +5 or more
* Familiar with robot type: -5 or more
* New skill not related to kinds of tasks robot designed to 
  undertake: +15 or more
* New skill somewhat related to kinds of tasks robot designed to 
  undertake: +10
* New skill almost but not quite related to kinds of tasks robot 
  designed to undertake: +5
* Robot has limited memory capacity: +10 or more
* Robot has large memory capacity: -5 or more


Search (Perception)
-------------------

When used to eavesdrop on or secretly watch an event or another
character, the skill total indicates the amount of information gained
from the surveillance. Use the "Observation Difficulties" table found at
the beginning of this chapter. A Critical Failure could mean anything
from no information obtained to being immediately spotted by the
character being observed, depending on the situation.

When searching for a hidden object or person, the difficulty is
generally the hide roll used to conceal the target. Otherwise, the base
difficulty is 5, modiﬁed by the table below.

See also "Observation Skills" in this chapter for more difficulties
and modiﬁers for this skill.


*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Character knows target's exact location: 0
* Character knows target's approximate location: +5
* Character has vague information about the target or its location: +15
* Character has only general idea of what she's looking for; searching 
  for small objects: +20
* Character has no idea what she's looking for; searching for obscure 
  or tiny objects:+25
* Searching for microscopic objects (Might not be possible without 
  special equipment or abilities.): +30

When attempting to track someone, the base difficulty is 10 or
the target's sneak roll, if the target is actively trying to hide her trail.
Characters can also use search to shadow a target.


*Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Trail is a day old: +3
* Trail is a few days old: +6
* Trail is a week old: +9
* Tracking during inclement weather: +6
* Soft dirt, mud, snow: -3
* Grassland: 0
* Forest, thin crowd: +3
* Rain forest, dense crowd: +6
* Desert, arctic wasteland, hard surface: +9
* Number of people being tracked (for every 2 people): -3
* Tracking a wheeled vehicle: -6
* Per additional vehicle: -3


Security (Technical)
--------------------

Opening locks that don't require deftness of hand fall under this 
skill, as does setting up a defensive perimeter and installing a 
security system. Security always requires special tools, which might 
give their own bonus. This skill can complement investigation when 
trying to survey the security of a building.


*Type of System: Difficulty*

* No special protection: 4
* Regular security system: 8
* High-quality system: 14
* Bank: 20
* High-security complex: 25
* Cutting-edge security measures: 30


Shields (Mechanical)
--------------------

See the "Space Travel" chapter for details on employing this skill.


Sleight of Hand (Agility)
-------------------------

The difficulty for a sleight of hand attempt is usually the opponent's 
Perception or search, either as a die roll (if the opponent is actively
watching for tricks) or as a derived value equal to the number in front 
of the "D" in the opponent's attribute or skill times 2 and add the pips.

*Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Watchful target; few distractions: +9
* Observant target; light crowd: +6
* Suspicious target: +3
* Challenging act (such as palming a baseball): +6 or more
* Unobservant target; target constantly jostled; major distractions: -9
* Confused or distracted target; crowded conditions; minor 
  distractions:-6
* Simple act (such as palming a tiny object or sliding a hand into 
  one's own pocket unnoticed): -6 or more



Characters also may use sleight of hand to pick locks, but they may
not attempt to do so without some kind of tools (hairpins, wire coat
hanger, telekinesis, etc.). Improvised tools do not add to character's
skill roll, but specialized tools will.


*Type of Lock: Difficulty*

* Simple key lock: 6
* Complex key lock: 12
* Combination lock: 18


*Lock Condition: Modiﬁer*

* Poorly constructed: -6
* Well constructed: +2
* Military or security style: +6
* High security style: +9
* Lock blueprints and diagrams: -4


Stamina (Strength)
------------------

Gamemasters may allow a character to make a multiaction stamina roll 
to complement a strenuous activity, such as lifting or running.
The difficulty equals 5 times the current fatigue modiﬁer. The character 
may add one-half (rounded up) of the difference between the successful 
stamina roll and the difficulty. The strenuous activity still receives 
the fatigue modiﬁer.

Whenever a character fails a stamina roll, she is fatigued; all actions 
are at -1D for every stamina check failed until the character rests for 
as long as she exerted herself.

Characters can still continue if they are fatigued, until they fail 
a third stamina check. At this point, the character is completely 
exhausted and must rest for twice the amount of time that she exerted 
herself to remove the penalty.

To avoid the effects of a toxin (inhaled, ingested, or absorbed) or disease
(encountered in any manner), a character makes a stamina roll. Several
factors ﬁgure into the difficulty of the attempt, including the deadliness
and dosage of the poison in question. For example, a fatal bout of botulism
has a difficulty of 9, while a killing dose of cyanide has a difficulty of 42.
Characters may attempt to counter toxins once per day.

Gamemasters might also call for stamina rolls against falling asleep
or unconscious. Resisting sleep is a difficulty of 5 per hour beyond the
normal awake time, modiﬁed by environmental factors (too warm or
too cold, noise level, etc.). For unconsciousness caused by wounds, see
the "Wound Levels" table in the "Damage" chapter.


Streetwise (Knowledge)
----------------------

Streetwise helps characters get around urban environments. Some 
situations call for seeking out those living outside the local law, 
while others can be handled through upstanding citizens. Generally, 
the modiﬁers are the same for each situation, but the gamemaster 
should adjust them depending on the circumstances. It is possible, 
though generally unlikely, that a character would be well-liked by 
both upstanding residents and local criminals.

Example: *In a village, a character would ﬁnd it easier to gather
information about a particular person (and thus the city-size modiﬁer 
would be -15 instead of +15), but he might have a harder time
getting someone to trust him enough to tell him about it (making the
tolerance modiﬁer +15).*

*Seeking: Difficulty*

* Things that are usually easy to ﬁnd (ex., directions to the nearest 
  police station): 4
* Things that require discretion or careful investigation (ex., asking 
  if the local law is straight or crooked): 7
* Risky services; ﬁnding illegal and well-regulated items (ex., ﬁnding 
  out an appropriate bribe for the local law): 14
* Services of unusual skills; ﬁnding dangerous or carefully controlled 
  items (ex., seeking a fence or a safecracker): 18
* A speciﬁc criminal in hiding; ﬁnding items whose possession means 
  immediate imprisonment: 28


*Size of City: Modiﬁer*

* Large city (one million or more citizens): 0
* Small city (several hundred thousand citizens): +5
* Town (several thousand citizens): +10
* Village (several hundred citizens): +15


*Amount of Law Enforcement or Tolerance of Residents: Modiﬁer*

* Martial law or no tolerance for criminals or outsiders: +15
* Criminal activity overlooked as long as it's discreet; slight 
  tolerance of outsiders: +10
* Criminal activity overlooked as long as it's not dangerous to the 
  general public; tolerance of outsiders: +5
* Criminal activity overlooked as long as it's not dangerous to the 
  local government; outsiders welcome: 0
* Anarchy; outsiders given same respect as residents: -10


*Reputation of Seeker: Modiﬁer*

* Never been to the location; no contacts; not trusted by local 
  underworld or residents: +10 or more
* Rarely visited; only passing knowledge of how the local underworld 
  operates: +1 to +9
* Minor contacts; knows what to avoid; criminals or residents have 
  no reason not to trust character: 0
* Somewhat favorably known by local underworld or residents; several 
  contacts: -1 to -9
* Well-known and liked by underworld or residents -10 or more


Survival (Knowledge)
--------------------

Character can rely on survival to ﬁgure out what to eat, where to

needed to get out of wilderness situation alive. (Use streetwise for help
in urban situations.)

Tactics (Knowledge)
-------------------

Tactics represents a character's skill in deploying military forces
and maneuvering them for the best advantage. Characters can rely on
it for general knowledge of how best to stage a military operation or
the best response to an opponent's move in battle. Tactics attempts can
complement command and combat rolls for the group the character
advises. The better the result, the more details a gamemaster should
give to help the character win the battle. Hints can take the form of
reminders about different moves the enemy can make, suggestions on
how to maneuver the character's forces, or (for especially good rolls) 
risky and unanticipated moves that could throw the enemy off guard.

Nonetheless, characters should keep in mind that tactics might
suggest a theoretically optimum solution, but the execution might not
come off as well as planned.

Tactics difficulties should be based on various factors of complexity 
within a battle: how many units are involved, the setting (empty
space, asteroid ﬁeld, planetary terrain), and the difference in training
and equipment between units (battleships versus in-system defenders; 
trained mercenaries versus primitive natives; space military versus
experienced rebels).


Throwing (Agility)
------------------

A character's ability to grab projectiles out of the air is enhanced by 
the throwing skill. The difficulty of catching an object is typically the 
thrower's throwing roll. If the thrower wants the catcher to get the 
object, and thus takes care to throw well, reduce the thrower's 
skill total by 9. The "Combat" chapter speciﬁes combat difficulties for 
this skill.


Willpower (Knowledge)
---------------------

Willpower is generally used to resist interaction attempts and mentally
damaging attacks. See the "Mental Defense" sidebar at the beginning of
this chapter for details. Characters with this skill may generally use it
instead of stamina to resist fatigue, sleep, and unconsciousness, though
there may be some situations the gamemaster restricts its substitution.
See the stamina entry in this chapter for information on difficulties.
Gamemaster can also use willpower (or Knowledge) to determine
the reactions of players' and gamemaster's characters to each other
and to their surroundings. The more the gamemaster believes that the
character should be at ease or frightened, the greater the difficulty. Use
the descriptions of standard difficulties to determine the level. This
passive application of willpower is not an action.


Metaphysics
===========

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

This chapter covers the ability to mentally control the energy of the
universe to bend the laws of the world around a character. Unlike its
cousin Psionics (which is described in D6 Adventure), which has a broad
range of focused skills, Metaphysics requires only a few skills in order
to creature a broad range of effects, though at a greater difficulty. The
Metaphysics skills are available only to characters with the Metaphysics
Extranormal attribute.


Obtaining Access to Metaphysics
-------------------------------

There are only two ways for players' characters to get metaphysical 
abilities. The ﬁrst is to put dice in the Metaphysics attribute and
skills at character creation, which costs the same as obtaining other
attributes.

The second is to obtain the gamemaster's permission after play has
begun. If the player can come up with a reason for the character to learn
or gain metaphysical abilities (such as they were latent or they appear
at a certain age because of the character's species) and the gamemaster
agrees, then the player may purchase them for the character. The cost
to get the initial 1D in Metaphysics is 20 Character Points. After that,
it is 10 times the number in front of the "D" to improve this attribute
by one pip. The player must still purchase Metaphysics skill pips 
separately, though a player may buy one pip in one Metaphysics skill for the
character at the same time as she initially gets the attribute.

Gamemasters are discouraged from allowing characters to have access
to multiple Extranormal abilities. However, it is possible, especially if
the character has several Disadvantages that show up frequently in
each session.


Learning and Improving Metaphysics Skills
-----------------------------------------

Metaphysics skills may be learned between adventures, like regular
skills. No precise formulae exist for metaphysical manipulations.
Teachers and their techniques help their students open their minds
further and control their ability to alter reality better.
The cost for a Metaphysics skill, in Character Points, equals twice
the normal cost for gaining or improving a normal skill. This cost is
doubled again if a teacher -- simply another manipulator of the 
metaphysical with the skill at a higher level -- is not available to 
instruct the character. A character may learn or improve one Metaphysics 
skill after each adventure.


Metaphysics Skills
------------------

Attempts to change reality are called manipulations and require one
of these skills in order to generate them. When using metaphysical forces,
the character generates a Metaphysics skill total and tries to beat the
manipulation's difficulty. If the skill total equals or exceeds the difficulty,
then the manipulation's effect works (to a greater or lesser extent).


### Channel ###

With this skill, a character can focus energy within herself and her
surroundings to harm others or protect herself and others from harm.
The most common effects produced with this skill include modifying
damage or Armor Value or generating a new damage or Armor Value.


### Sense ###

A character who has learned this skill can detect anything in existence,
learn about her surroundings, and touch and inﬂuence minds. Some
effects include: modifying Knowledge and general Perception attempts;
modifying existing or including stand-alone bargain, command, con,
investigation, persuasion, search, or Knowledge-related skills, especially
to discern speciﬁc information.


### Transform ###

This skill allows a character to alter temporarily people and things
within the universe, including moving something from one location
to another and changing a target's natural capabilities. Some effects
include: modifying a skill or attribute except general Perception uses,
bargain, command, con, investigation, persuasion, search, Knowledge, or
Knowledge-related skills; adding additional levels of a Special Ability the
target already has; giving a target a new Special Ability, Disadvantage, or
skill; placing new Limitations or Enhancements on an existing Special
Ability; moving targets; and modifying a target's Move value.
To move a target, the skill total has to overcome the target's weight
value. (Look up the target's mass on the "Lift Difficulties" table on page
91.) The target can resist by rolling her Strength or lift and adding it to
her weight difficulty (theoretically, she tries to make herself harder for
the manipulation to grasp; resisting does not count as an action for the
target character). If the transform total is equal to or higher than the
modiﬁed manipulation difficulty, the character is moved. This goes for
self-teleportation as well (though the character is not likely to resist).

Other Systems
-------------

Gamemasters allowing characters with mental abilities
made using other D6 rules sets to be transferred to this one
may ﬁnd it easier to rely on the rules from that system for those
characters rather than switching to the D6 Space rules.

However, characters using other psionic rules may not
rely on the D6 Space rules -- and vice versa. Consider each
psionics rules set as a different and distinct way special mental
abilities manifest themselves.

Designing the Manipulation
--------------------------

At this point, write out what you want the effect to do -- basically.
What sort of effect are you trying to create? How long will it last?
What range will you need? Consider all things along these lines. Having 
some general ideas up front will help you choose the values of the
various aspects of your effects. You can keep track of your ideas on the
Manipulation Worksheet included at the end of this chapter.


Aspects of a Manipulation
-------------------------

There are four primary and necessary aspects of a manipulation
that determine the difficulty to generate it: effect, target size, proximity,
and duration. The value of the effect decides the base difficulty, while
size, proximity, and duration modify this number.


### Effect and Skill Used ###

The ﬁrst step in creating a metaphysical manipulation is to decide
what it can do. This also helps you generate the initial difficulty. Once
you decide what the effect will do -- damage, protection, skill bonus,
and so on -- determine its corresponding value using the "Die Codes"
table. Here are some guidelines.

Damage effects affect character health (that is, their Body Points or
Wounds). To hurt someone, 6D (which you can determine, by using
the "Die Code" table, has a value of 12) is a safe bet. To kill someone
outright, 10D (which has a value of 20) is usually necessary.

Protection effects work similarly, though, obviously, they reduce the
amount of damage taken. Checking out weapon damage die codes can help
you determine the number of dice you need for your manipulation.

Effects that increase, decrease, or otherwise alter attributes or skills
are determined the same way. For example, taking over someone's
mind would give the metaphysicist a persuasion of 3D or more with
a value of at least 6.

Sometimes a Special Ability or a Disadvantage best reﬂects what an
effect can do. With a Special Ability, the effect's value equals 2 times the
Special Ability cost times the number of ranks in that Special Ability,
plus the cost of any Enhancements and their ranks, minus the cost of
any Limitations and their ranks. With a Disadvantage, the effect's value
equals 2 times the cost of the Disadvantage. Effects generally do not
provide a target with Advantages or affect the Funds attribute.

Manipulation effects that don't fall into any category should be
given a difficulty and the circumstance in which the difficulty can be
beat. The difficulty equals the effect's value.

A manipulation may contain more than one effect. Each effect is
determined separately and added to the total. All of the effects must
fall under the domain of the same skill. You should also list the skill
used to create the manipulation at this time. See the skill descriptions
for suggestions.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Die Codes
---------

*Values are cumulative, so, if the effect has a die code of
3D, the effect's difficulty is 6.*

*Characteristic Type: Difficulty per 1D*

* Damage (mental or physical): 2
* Protection (mental or physical): 2
* Stand-alone die code or non-Extranormal skill: 2
* Non-Extranormal skill modiﬁer: 5
* Non-Extranormal attribute modiﬁer: 6
* Stand-alone Extranormal skill: 6
* Extranormal skill modiﬁer: 7
* Extranormal attribute modiﬁer: 9

*Mental and physical effects represent seperate skills that each type 
must be purchased separately.*

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


### Perceptible Versus Imperceptible Effects ###

For nearly all manipulations, the target or the people near the
metaphysicist should sense the effect in some way, whether it be hearing 
the character's voice as she attempts to use an augmented skill that
requires vocalization, a glow indicating a blast has just gone off, or an
aura showing that the character is enhanced. Having a perceivable
effect neither adds to nor subtracts from the difficulty.

Some effects cannot be detected through taste, physical sensations,
hearing, sight, or scent. This includes instantaneous location-to-location 
movement and direct mind-to-mind communication. This adds
4 per die code or every ﬁve points of the effect's value (round up).
Thus, a manipulation's imperceptible effect with a value of 11 has a
+12 to the modiﬁer.

The imperceptibility of the effect is in addition to any modiﬁer that
may further make the application of the manipulation obvious.


### Target Size ###

The size and number of targets is another essential element of a
manipulation. Use the accompanying chart to decide on the desired
number of targets or a single target's size. Add it to the manipulation's
difficulty.

Should the metaphysicist wish to affect a group of people or items
at once, all members of a targeted group must be within a meter of
another member of that group and they must be of approximately the
same size. Otherwise, use a smaller difficulty modiﬁer and determine
the effect on each smaller group separately.


### Range ###

Next, determine how far away you want the metaphysicist to be
able to affect things with the manipulation. Any manipulation effect
reaches its target instantly, but if you want to move it, you also must
include the range modiﬁer for the distance you want the target to
travel. (This is in addition to the modiﬁer to get to the target.) Use the
accompanying chart to pick a level that contains your desired range.
Add it to the manipulation's difficulty.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### Aspects ###

*Target Size: Difficulty Modiﬁer*

* Small item or handful of tiny items: +1
* Person: +2
* Few people, personal vehicle: +3
* Group, small mass transport, room: +5
* Crowd, large mass transport, small building: +10
* Horde, huge mass transport, large building: +15


*Range to Target or Effect: Difficulty Modiﬁer*

* Touching: -2
* Point Blank (in sight within 3 meters but not touching); self: 0
* Close (3-100 meters away; out of sight but near): +5
* Long (over 100 meters but less than 10 kilometers away): +7
* Extreme (over 10 kilometers but less than 1,000 kilometers 
  away): +10
* Atmosphere (over 1,000 kilometers away but on same planet/orbiting 
  vessel):+15
* System (on a different planet/orbiting vessel that's in the same 
  star system): +20
* Sector (in a nearby star system): +30
* Galactic (in the same galaxy but different star systems): +60


*Duration: Difficulty Modiﬁer*

* 2 rounds: 0
* Each additional round, up to one minute: +1
* Each additional ﬁve minutes, up to one hour: +1
* Each additional hour (cumulative with other modiﬁers): +1

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


### Duration ###

Finally, decide how long the manipulation will last. Again, the 
accompanying chart can help you ﬁgure out the modiﬁer to the difficulty.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed by the manipulation (or the gamemaster),
a character may rely on a manipulation's effect once per round.


Manipulation Difﬁculty
----------------------

Once you have determined all of the aspects of the manipulation,
add them together to get the difficulty for using it. The metaphysicist
rolls the appropriate Metaphysics skill against this difficulty to 
determine success; see "Releasing the Manipulation" later in this chapter 
for details. The skill total can be modiﬁed by various circumstances; the
"Situation Modiﬁers" section offers some suggestions.


Design Time
-----------

Metaphysical manipulations never require the character to spend
time designing a manipulation or going through preparations to use it.
However, characters can improve their ability to create the manipulation 
by concentrating on their desired effect before releasing it. (See
the concentration modiﬁer later in this chapter for details.)


Situation Modiﬁers
------------------

Various situations can change a character's ability to make a manipulation 
happen. These generic and optional modiﬁers can further affect the
difficulty, generally trading a negative effect on the character for a lower
difficulty or a higher skill total. Note that none of these modiﬁers are
required to use any Metaphysics skill, but they can help.

* Community: Unless the gamemaster rules otherwise, characters
with metaphysical skills may help each other, using the game mechanics
in the"Related Skills" section in the"Game Basics" chapter as guidelines.
Metaphysicists also may gain aid from characters with certain other
Extranormal attributes, such as Psionics, though only the Extranormal
attribute is used and the bonus is one-half of normal (round up).

* Components, Incantations, and Gestures: Metaphysical talents
only require the power of the brain, although a person can have a
psychological dependency on a certain sort of item to use his gift more
effectively. A novice character just beginning his training might require
a symbol of his order, for example. This is a psychological crutch, which
can be reﬂected in the character concept as the Advantage Flaw (R3):
Minor Stigma Disadvantage, but it has no bearing on the difficulty
of the metaphysical attempt. Nonetheless, gamemasters may allow a
modiﬁer to the Metaphysics skill total modiﬁer per type of additional
part. There is a limit of one component, one incantation, and one gesture
per skill attempt. See the accompanying charts on the next page for skill
modiﬁers. This can be combined with a concentration modiﬁer.
Note that using the skill provided by a manipulation does not count
as an incantation or gesture.

* Concentration: The character spends time preparing herself before
releasing her will on the world. For each round in which the character
concentrates strictly on her upcoming action (with or without performing 
related incantations or gestures), the player may add a bonus
of +1 to the skill total. Additionally, add the number of rounds in
concentration to 6 to get the willpower difficulty, which the character
rolls at the end of the concentration time. (The gamemaster may adjust
this based on the circumstances; see the chart on the next page for
suggestions.) If the character fails the willpower roll, the metaphysical
attempt fails. A Critical Failure on the willpower roll indicates that
the character takes any feedback associated with the skill used, even
though it didn't work.

Example: *Four rounds of concentration gives a +4 bonus with a
willpower difficulty of 10.*

The player must specify, before having her character concentrate,
which Metaphysics skill the bonus will affect and how it will affect that
skill. The bonus cannot be transferred to another skill.

### Components ###

*Component is: Skill Modiﬁer*

* Very common, easily purchased or traded for (match, wooden board, 
  candle): +2
* Common, but must be purchased for reasonable cost (lighter, 
  inexpensive clothing, oil, incense): +3
* Uncommon (rare in some places, common in others; gun, computer 
  chip, prescription medicine): +4
* Very rare (rare in most places or expensive) (valuable gem, precious 
  metal, rare drug, exotic herb): +5
* Extremely rare (near-priceless gem, plutonium): +6
* Unique (burial mask of a long-dead king): +7


### Gestures ###

*Complexity: Skill Modiﬁer*

* Simple (point ﬁnger, hold out symbol): +1
* Fairly simple (make circles with ﬁnger, wave hands): +2


### Incantations ###

*Complexity: Skill Modiﬁer*

* A few words or sounds: +1
* A complete sentence or lengthy phrase: +2
* Also must be said very loudly: +1


### Concentration Distractions ###

*Level of Distraction: Modiﬁer to willpower difficulty*

* Completely isolated chamber: 0
* Isolated, but some distractions (trees, birds chirping, pictures, 
  white noise): +2
* On a park bench, with a few passers-by: +6
* In a room with a few other people who are being quiet: +8
* Alone in a booth at a sparsely ﬁlled restaurant: +10
* Alone at a table in the middle of a sparsely ﬁlled restaurant: +14
* Alone at a booth in at a busy hour; in a telephone booth, with many 
  people passing by: +16
* At a restaurant booth with a few other people who are being 
  quiet: +18
* Packed ballroom: +20


### Countenance ###

*Change in Appearance: Skill Modiﬁer*

* Noticeable (gray pallor, foaming): +1
* Extreme (convulsions, prominent illusion): +2
* Also permanently disturbs target (per every +5 to difficulty 
  of future interaction attempts. This may only be included if 
  target is intelligent and can see the countenance change.): +1


### Link to Target ###

*Relationship: Skill Modifier*

* Constant inﬂuence (parents, grandparents, spouse, old friends; 
  known 10+ years): +5
* Recent inﬂuence (friends, roommates, old enemies; known 5-10 
  years): +3
* Newer inﬂuence (friends, acquaintances; known 1-5 years): +2
* Sporadic inﬂuence (on-and-off relationships): +2
* New acquaintances (known 2-6 months): 0
* New faces/only just met, but have talked for a while (at a party 
  or large function): -2
* Personal sight and name recognition (have met in person 
  brieﬂy): -3
* Distant sight and name recognition (celebrities never met in 
  person): -5
* Only a name or only a face: -8
* Complete strangers and not of the same species: -12

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


* Countenance: Metaphysicists' bodies can undergo changes
due to side effects of their reality-altering talents. Some go
pale or even blue with a lack of blood ﬂow to their skin, the
hair on some stands up as if by static electricity, others shake
uncontrollably or foam at the mouth, while others get bulging
eyes or swollen lolling tongues. Illusory changes are also possible, 
such as glowing eyes or a bright aura. The physical shell
can react in unpredictable ways to the effects of extrasensory
perception. The corresponding chart lists modiﬁers to the
Metaphysics skill difficulty.

* Feedback: For every -2 to her damage resistance total, the
character receives a +1 to the Metaphysics skill total. Neither
protective gear nor any type of Special Ability may defend
against feedback. The damage resistance modiﬁer drops at a
rate of one-half of a roll of the character's Metaphysics per day,
with the decrease occurring at the beginning of a new day.

* Link to Target: When a metaphysicist wishes to seek out a
speciﬁc person, the relationship to that person can affect how
easy it is to get in touch with the person. Include the Link to
Target skill total modiﬁer when using the relevant skill (see
accompanying table on the next page). Note that this is different
than an astral anchor in that the character and her target need
not have been in recent contact. The gamemaster can also use
these modiﬁers for honing in on speciﬁc items.

* Other: The gamemaster may allow other modiﬁers to the
skill roll. Refer the "Generic Difficulty Modiﬁers" on page 61 to
get an idea, though, of course, add to the skill total any modiﬁers
for circumstances that make creating the manipulation easier,
but subtract from the skill total any modiﬁers for situations
that make manipulating reality harder.

* Result Points: The result points (the difference between
the Metaphysics skill roll and the manipulation's difficulty)
can help in a future attempt with that skill or by improving
some application of the current use. Add one-half of the result
points as the bonus to the effect, range, duration, or other
appropriate feature. (Round fractions up.) The gamemaster
might also use the result points to determine how effective
the manipulation was.

* Untrained: Many Metaphysics skills may be used (or
rather, "experienced") even if the character has no dice in the
particular skill. For those who have some training (that is, pips
or dice in any Metaphysics skill), the difficulty increases by +5
to implement a manipulation using a skill in which they have
no experience. For those who have no training (that is, no pips
or dice in any Metaphysics skill but they do have dice in the
Metaphysics attribute), the difficulty increases by +10.


Releasing the Manipulation
--------------------------

Roll the Metaphysics skill for the manipulation in question
to get a skill total, adding or subtracting any modiﬁers appropriate 
for the user's situation. If the total equals or exceeds the
difficulty number, the manipulation has succeeded and the
metaphysicist may use the manipulation's effect.

Which skill the manipulation requires is either decided when the
effect is developed or listed with a precalculated manipulation.

Remember that players may spend Character and Fate Points to make
sure they have sufficiently high skill totals to generate the manipulation
in addition to relying on various situational modiﬁers.

The effect is applied differently depending on its purpose. There is
no design time for creating a manipulation.

* Skill Simulations: Some manipulations provide the target with
skills or bonuses to skills or attributes. For instance, a manipulation
that heals would give a character a certain number of dice in medicine,
and the result of using the manipulation's skill gift would be compared
to the normal difficulty for using medicine on a target. Any attribute
bonuses affect the skills and specializations under them, and any skill
bonuses add to the specializations under them (if the target has any).
Targets use gifted skills and skill and attribute bonuses normally and
as separate actions from the Metaphysics attempt.

* Protection: Characters using protecting manipulations rely on
their effect just as they would a piece of protective gear.
General Effects: When the manipulation offers a "general" effect,
and thus has no targeting or manipulative skill associated with it, the
gamemaster will have to make up levels of success for that manipulation. 
A minimal success, with the roll equal to the difficulty, means that
the manipulation was slightly off or less than perfect. A solid success
of one to ﬁve points over the difficulty usually gets the manipulation
to do exactly what the user wants the manipulation to do. A superior
success of six points over the difficulty reveals that the manipulation
worked better than usual; at this level, the gamemaster might even
provide a bonus to its use.

* Damage and Targeted Manipulations: If the manipulation focuses
on a target (such as a blast or translocation manipulation), the player
and gamemaster must decide what skill (such as ﬁrearms, melee combat,
or throwing) to use to hit, if it's not already built into the manipulation
or described with it, as well as the appropriate defense, if any. 
(Gamemasters who prefer to keep activation skills within the metaphysical
arts could allow a separate channel roll as the targeting skill.) Attack
manipulations, for example, would use standard combat difficulties and
modiﬁers for their defense (regardless of the targeting skill). Common
sense should be used to determine which skill and defense to use.

Example: *With a blast manipulation, the gamemaster decides that
the metaphysicist has to generate a ﬁrearms skill total to hit his target.
Even though the energy will go where he wants it to, there still has to be
some way to determine whether or not anybody is hit by it.*

This keeps effects from being automatic "killers." Granted, most
manipulation won't need this -- a manipulation that a character uses
to take over a target's mind needs no "to hit" total; it is instead the 
effect versus the target's willpower or Knowledge.

Releasing a manipulation at the same time as using its targeting
or activation skill is not considered a multi-action. However, if the
character wishes to release an attack manipulation, which requires a
targeting skill roll, and ﬁre a gun in the same round, then the 
multiaction modiﬁer of -1D (for taking two actions in the same round) is
applied to the manipulation activation roll, the manipulation targeting
roll, and the weapon targeting roll.

For manipulations targeting groups, the metaphysicist applies
the targeting skill once and that number is compared to each target's
difficulty to hit it.

In general, any manipulation that works like a weapon requires this
kind of control, and a few others might. Gamemasters in doubt may
wish to assign a targeting skill check in addition to the manipulation
skill difficulty.


Reﬂux Option
------------

At the gamemaster's option, characters who roll a Critical Failure
with an abysmally small skill total becoming disoriented and lose all of
their actions in the next round. The universe rejected their 
manipulation and hit them back.


Increasing Resistance Option
----------------------------

As another option to control metaphysicists, for each additional time
the character uses the same manipulation on the same target, the 
difﬁculty goes up by +5. It's possible that the result point bonus will 
cancel this difficulty, but the universe continues to try to resist change.


Sample Manipulations
--------------------

These sample manipulations provide a basic idea of what a character 
can do with the Metaphysics ability. They should be each taken
as only one example of how such a manipulation of reality could be
represented.

### Psionics and Manipulations ###

If you have the D6 Adventure rulebook, you can use the
Psionics skills in there to create versions of send thoughts, receive
thoughts, mind probe, and telekinesis based on those skills.

those hiding near her. Each round, the character may look in a new
direction without having to reactivate the manipulation. (She does need
to roll the manipulation's search skill for each new area.) The greater
the roll with the effect, the more information she learns. Characters
may attempt to hide themselves by rolling their willpower or Knowledge
or by creating an appropriate manipulation. The results are then read
as points above this difficulty, instead of points rolled with the search
skill. With a Critical Failure result, add the total normally, including
the one on the Wild Die, and use the results of one level less than that
total. For totals that would have been minimal, the Critical Failure
causes the metaphysicist to lose one round of using this manipulation
due to confusion.

*Result: Information Gained*

* 1-6: Knows that there are life forms in the target area, but 
  not how many
* 7-11: Knows the number of beings
* 12-13: Knows whether any of the beings in the area have an 
  Extranormal attribute (Metaphysics, Psionics, etc.)
* 14-15: Knows whether she's met each being before, and if yes, who 
  the being is
* 15-16: Knows the gender and species of the being

to another location within 100 meters of where she started. It takes one
round to dematerialize and one round to rematerialize. Note: When
adjusting this manipulation to work on another character, unwilling
characters get a chance to resist, adding a roll of their lift or 
Strength to the base difficulty of the manipulation, making themselves 
harder to grasp. (Resisting does not count as an action for the target.)

Equipment
=========

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

This chapter gives game mechanics for popular equipment, including
gear, armor, and weapons, plus how to purchase them. Game effects
for various weapon types are also included. Gamemasters will need
to decide what's suitable for their particular settings. All equipment
described herein is of the basic variety.


Purchasing Equipment
--------------------

Each piece of equipment has a price difficulty associated with it
that expresses how challenging it is for a character to obtain that
item. If using Funds as an attribute, to purchase an item, the player
rolls the attribute against the listed purchase difficulty, adjusted by the
gamemaster for the circumstances around obtaining the item (such
as seller's stock, item quality, general item availability, and so on). A
player may attempt to use bargain to haggle over the list price (and
thus change the price difficulty). Review the bargain skill entry on page
87 for details. The gamemaster may include modiﬁers to the seller's
roll or value (such as local law, relationship of buyer and seller, and so
on). Likewise, gamemasters may allow players' characters to help each
other obtain particularly expensive items (such as spaceships) through
complementary Funds rolls.

If the Funds total equals or exceeds the price difficulty, the character
gets the item.

Any item with a price difficulty equal to or less than the number in
front of the "D" in the character's Funds attribute is an automatic 
purchase. A character may make several automatic purchases per day.

Any item with a price difficulty greater than the number in front
of the "D" in the character's Funds attribute but less than or equal to
3 times that number is an average purchase. A character may make
one average purchase per day.

Any item with a price difficulty greater than 3 times the number in
front of the "D" in the character's Funds attribute is a luxury purchase.
A character may make one luxury purchase every seven days.
When deciding on the type of purchase, include in the difficulty
breakdowns any modiﬁers due to an Advantage or Disadvantage.

Example: *A character has 3D+2 in her Funds attribute. Her automatic 
purchases have a difficulty of 3 or less. Her average purchases
have a difficulty of 4 to 9. Her luxury purchases have a difficulty of
10 or more. If the character also had Wealth (R1), she would add her
bonus of +10 to each of these levels, giving her automatic purchases at
13 or less, average purchases between 14 and 19, and luxury purchases
at 20 or more.*

Failure on a Funds roll means that the character didn't have the money for
some reason (maxing out a credit line, forgetting to transfer money to 
the correct account, leaving the wallet at home, etc.). Except when the 
total is abysmal, the character may roll again after a short period of 
time and attempting to ﬁx the problem (switching credit cards, moving 
money, getting money from the safe, etc.).

Unless the gamemaster decides otherwise, players may not spend 
Character and Fate Points on Funds rolls.

The price difficulties given in the equipment descriptions in this 
chapter are suitable for most science ﬁction settings. They do not take 
into account any modiﬁers the gamemaster may wish to include.

### Price Difﬁculties ###

*Cost of Item or Service: Difficulty Level*

* Cheap (several credits or less): Very Easy (VE)
* Inexpensive (less than 200 credits): Easy (E)
* Nominally expensive (hundreds of credits): Moderate (M)
* Somewhat expensive (a few thousand credits): Difficult (D)
* Expensive (several thousand credits): Very Difficult (VD)
* Very Expensive (tens of thousands of credits): Heroic (H)
* Costly (a few hundred thousand credits; "Costly" is hardly the top 
  end, and gamemasters should continue adding to the difficulty for 
  higher prices.): Legendary (L)


*Item or Service Is: Minimum Modiﬁer*

* Common; average quality: 0
* Very common; local market is ﬂooded; of slightly lower technological 
  complexity than commonly available: -5
* In high demand; limited availability; of slightly higher technological 
  complexity than commonly available: +5
* Not generally available to the public; of signiﬁcantly higher 
  technological complexity than commonly available: +15
* Out of season or from a distant location: +15 or more
* Unusually high quality: +5
* Damaged or low quality: -5


*Relationship with Seller: Bargain Modiﬁer*

* Has dealt with rarely or never: 0
* Pays on time; frequent customer; no complaints by seller: -1 or more
* Rarely pays on time; problem buyer: +1 or more

Gear
----

* Binoculars: +1D bonus to sightbased rolls for viewing objects beyond
seven feet in the daylight and twilight.
Cost: Easy.

* Comlink: The standard unit of communication equipment, comlinks 
come in a number of different forms. The most common is the
handset, which has an effective range of 10 kilometers and is widely
available on the open market. These also can be purchased as headsets.
Cost: Easy.

    * Military comlinks have a greater range (approximately 25 kilometers), 
    and are frequently belt units or built into enviro-suit helmets, to
    allow the soldier to keep her hands free for combat. Cost: Moderate.
    Many high-tech worlds feature communications satellites that allow
    comlink signals to reach anywhere on the planet.

* Cred-key: A small plastic card that, when placed in a cred-key
receiver, can perform all banking functions. Cred-keys are used by
virtually all high-tech worlds, though not all worlds have compatible
banking systems. Many frontier worlds do not have the equipment
necessary to read the cards and so will only accept hard currency.

    * Standard cred-keys contain the name of the bearer and a personal
    identiﬁcation number. Megacorporate-issued cred-keys usually feature
    the name of the ﬁrm and a code for it as well. Military officers, who
    may have extensive credit limits owing to their status, carry cards with
    their DNA pattern encoded on them for ease of identiﬁcation.

    * Cred-keys are not common on worlds with extensive smuggling,
    piracy, or other criminal activities -- they are too hard to steal and
    use. A character must be able to generate a forgery, a personal equipment 
    repair, and a computer interface/repair skill total of at least 21
    each to forge or strip a civilian cred-key. (Military and megacorp keys
    are harder to do this to.) Even then, decent detection equipment (not
    usually found in stores and bars, but common in banks and large-purchase 
    retail outlets) will probably be able to detect the forgery. 
    Cost: Very Easy to set one up; some fees to transfer money.

* Crowbar: Gives a +1D bonus to prying attempts, or does Strength
Damage +2 in damage with bashing attacks. Cost: Very Easy.

* Enviro-suit: The basic environmental protection gear, the
enviro-suit is designed for use in hostile climates or worlds whose
atmosphere is unsafe. The envirosuit features a helmet and full body
suit (the helmet is detachable). Air is recycled by the mechanisms in the
suit and bodily moisture is also ﬁltered, to be stored in pouches inside
the suit. Straws run up the suit and into the helmet to allow the user to
take a drink.

    * Enviro-suits commonly have comlink units built into the helmet
    and the belt. A small indicator light in the helmet ﬂashes when in the 
    presence of another comlink trained to the same frequency. An enviro-suit
    maintains a constant temperature around its wearer that can be adjusted 
    via controls on the belt.

    * A standard enviro-suit offers only a single layer of protection (Armor
    Value +1), which, if torn or pierced, renders the entire suit inoperative. 
    More expensive suits offer two layers of protection, with a liquid 
    sealant stored between the interior and the exterior. Damage done to
    the exterior layer can be sealed within one round (Armor Value +2).
    However, extensive damage rapidly exhausts the supply of sealant. (The
    average outﬁt comes with enough sealant to repair 20 small tears or 10
    large ones.)

    * Enviro-suits can hold enough air, food, and recycled water for several
    days to several weeks of use; about two weeks is standard. They can be
    reﬁlled off of shipboard supplies (deducting the life support from the
    ship's life support) or they can be reﬁlled at stations and similar places
    for 10% of the base cost of the suit. Cost of suit: Moderate.
    Flashlight: Small ﬂashlights reduces darkness modiﬁers by 2D in
    a cone-shaped area up to ﬁve meters from the user. The internal 
    batteries can be recharged off any local current (the base includes 
    several adapters). Cost: Very Easy.

* Hand Comp: Portable and easy to use, hand computers feature rapid
processing power, including high quantities of high-speed memory and
high capacity, multifunctional chip drives. Most come with a port for
connection to a neural jack, as well as cable interfaces for connecting to
larger terminals. Smaller computers have slots for a few scholarchips,
while larger ones have room for several. Cost: Moderate.
Handcuffs: Low-tech metal adjustable restraints require the key or
a Moderate sleight of hand roll to remove; 18 Body Points/2 Wound
levels; damage resistance total 15. Key comes with purchase of handcuffs. 
Cost: Very Easy.

* Hand Scanner: A portable sensor device, the hand scanner has an
effective range of 10 kilometers. It can be set to pick up motion, particular 
types of matter, and even indications of power generation. They are
standard equipment for scouts and are frequently used by miners.
Use of a scanner provides a +1D to sensors. Use the "Information
Difficulties" or "Observation Difficulties" charts in the "Example Skill
Difficulties" chapter to determine what the scanner reveals. Most hand
scanners can only be blocked by cover over three solid meters thick
(several thick concrete walls or the bulkhead of a ship will usually
block scanner readings, but only the most dense of forests or jungles
will have any effect at all). Cost: Moderate.

* Holo-vid Player: This device provides holographic images drawn
from data chips for entertainment or informational purposes. Holovids 
can also be connected to comlinks to provide for audio and visual
contact between parties. Some holo-vids have the capability to jack
into hand computers, projecting the information on scholarchips out
for all to read. Cost: Moderate.

* Life-Support Reﬁlls: These are "tanks" of atmosphere and food
supplies that can be attached to an environment suit and some portable
shelters. They last roughly two weeks and weigh less than 10 kilograms.
Cost: Moderate.

* Lockpicking Tools: +1D bonus to lockpicking attempts only if
the user has the sleight of hand skill. Cost: Easy.

* Med-kit: An assortment of medical supplies collected into a lightweight 
container that allows for easy transport. Med-kits normally
contain antibiotic patches, a compressed-air hypodermic injector, three
doses of pain killers, bandages, and tape. Use of a standard med-kit
provides a +1D bonus to medicine skill checks. Cost: Easy.

* Rope, Heavy (braided plastic): Inﬂicts Strength Damage +2
when used in choking attacks; 10 Body Points/1 Wound level; damage
resistance total 5. Cost: Very Easy.

* Rope, Light (braided nylon): Inﬂicts Strength Damage +1 when
used in choking attacks; 6 Body Points/1 Wound level; damage resistance 
total 3. Cost: Very Easy.

* Scholarchips: Computer chips intended for use with both hand units 
and larger terminals. These contain available information on sectors,
planets, some alien species, equipment, ships, personal data, business 
transactions, and so on. Use of a computer with a standard scholarchip 
in place allows the operator to roll as if he possessed a scholar or 
appropriate Knowledge-based skill in the subject detailed on the chip.
Of course, the broader the range of information, and the more encrypted
it is, the harder it is to get at what the character needs. Cost: Very 
Easy for base die code of 1D, +1 to the price for each additional +1D.

* Shovel: Add 1D to digging attempts, or does Strength Damage
+2 in damage with bashing attacks. Cost: Very Easy.

* Signal Locator: This device, which has a restricted distribution,
monitors the signals of tracking devices. It includes a small display to
show direction of movement. Pricier ones can pinpoint the location
on an electronic map. Cost: Moderate.

* Thermo-disk: Useful gear when traveling in a wilderness area,
thermo-disks are spheroid plasticene items, roughly the size of the average
Human's ﬁst. They contain storage batteries that, when switched on, give
off heat in a 25-meter radius. As they do not provide light, they can be
used in hostile areas without betraying of one's presence. Cost: Easy.

* Tool Kit: Contains tools (and possibly parts or storage containers)
necessary to accomplish basic related tasks. Add 1D to relevant skill
attempts only if the user has the appropriate skill (usually some version
of repair, but investigation in the case of an evidence or archaeologist's
kit, con: disguise in the case of a disguise kit, or certain applications of
artist or forgery with artistic supplies). Cost: Very Easy to Moderate.

* Tracking Device: Used with a signal locator, this miniature transmitter 
allows whatever is attached to it to be electronically located over
a distance. Active devices emit a signal, while passive ones wait for a
signal to come to it before sending out a response. Cost: Moderate.


Robots
------

Robots are nonsentient automatons with a programmed algorithm
they must follow. They can be used for maintenance, security -- just
about anything. Interaction skills have no effect on them.
Movement may be provided by legs, wheels, treads, hoverjets, or
something similar and appropriate for the medium the robot most
likely travels through or on.

A robot is preprogramme for each task it can do; its skills
represent this programming. Furthermore, most robots don't have
dice in attributes, though highly sophisticated ones might.

Most robots can only attempt action they have skills for. Any action
that requires a skill the mechanical construct does not have cannot be
done. Robots with any of the attributes can adapt to circumstances
covered by that attribute and make limited decisions not necessarily
dealt with by their programming (that is, their listed skills). For robots
that can do this, skill attempts that default to the attribute are at +7.
This accounts for the robot being smart but not terribly creative.

Example: *A character and a robot (with no attributes) are
challenged with repairing a damaged laser pistol. If neither has the
ﬁrearms repair skill, the character gets to attempt to roll her Technical
with +5 to the difficulty of the task. The simply programmed robot
would not be able to repair the damaged weapon at all, because it
doesn't know how.*

A robot can never perform con, willpower, or Metaphysics or other
Extranormal attribute actions. Robots use their dodge or search to
determine initiative; if they have neither, they go last.


Maintenance Robot
-----------------

This little robot comes packed with a variety of tools and diagnostic
equipment to perform maintenance on just about anything. Its locking
wheels allow it scoot across most relatively ﬂat surfaces, though it can't
increase its rate beyond its base.

Skills: exoskeleton repair 3D, ﬁrearms repair 3D, ﬂight systems
repair 3D, gunnery repair 3D, personal equipment repair 3D, robot
interface/repair: damage only 3D, vehicle repair 3D. Move: 8. Size: 2
meters. Equipment: Various repair and diagnostic tools, plus parts; laser
welder (damage 4D if improperly used). Cost: Very Difficult.


Robotic Servitor
----------------

Generally humanoid in appearance, robotic servitors perform a variety
of tasks around the house. Though they come with a general program for
tidiness, the owner should make certain to deﬁne any limits immediately,
or she could ﬁnd herself with a domicile that's too clean.

Skills: artist: cooking 4D, cultures 3D, know-how: housecleaning
7D, languages 3D, scholar 2D. Move: 10. Size: 1.2 meters. Equipment:
cleaning supplies and tools stored in various compartments built into
body. Cost: Very Difficult.


Security Robot
--------------

The most basic and popular security robots can identify a preprogrammed 
list of visitors; anyone not on that list is turned away. Those
who refuse receive a stunning blast. Some crime lords alter the basic
model with deadly force.

Skills: ﬁrearms 5D, dodge 6D, intimidation 5D, running 4D. Move: 11. 
Size: 1.7 meters. Equipment: stun gun in arm (damage 6D stun
only). Cost: Heroic.


Protective Gear
---------------

### Combining Protective Gear ###

A character cannot wear two suits of the same type, though he could
combine some types. The listing herein indicates what armor may be
worn with what other armor and the kind of bonus it can provide.
Of course, layering armor assumes that the two pieces ﬁt 
together -- a character couldn't wear two helmets, even if they were 
made of different materials. For protective gear not listed here, use 
the type that the armor in question most closely resembles to determine 
what it can be combined with.

Except armor providing less than a full die of protection, any allowed
combination offers the character the complete armor bonus for both
layers, up to any maximums dictated by the gamemaster.

* Hides and Fur; Bone and Hide: May be worn over any other type
of armor. May not be worn under anything. Adds a maximum of 1 to
the Armor Value of the total combination.

* Soft Leather, Canvas, Heavy Khaki, Syntheleather: May be worn
over or under any other type of armor. Adds a maximum of 1 to the
Armor Value of the total combination.

* Padded Leather/Flying Jacket, Syntheleather Mesh, Woven
Metal Fabric: May be worn under any type of armor or over soft leather,
canvas, heavy khaki, syntheleather, chain mail, plastovar, syntheleather
mesh, padded, or metal fabric (though two armors of the same type
may not be combined).

* Chain Mail: May be worn over or under any other type of armor.
Reﬂec: A reﬂective material layered on a thin plastic base, this may
be worn over any other armor or over or under clothes.

* Plastovar: May be worn under soft leather, canvas, heavy khaki,
syntheleather, or syntheleather mesh, or over padded, syntheleather
mesh, or woven metal fabric.

* Plasteel: May be worn over soft leather, canvas, heavy khaki, padded,
or syntheleather, or under syntheleather mesh or woven metal fabric.
Plate Mail, Bulletproof Vest, Flak Jacket, Light Kevlar, Heavy
Kevlar, Ceramic Armor: May not be worn under anything. May be
worn over soft leather, canvas, heavy khaki, metallic woven fabric, or
chain mail.


### Encumbrance Option ###

Wearing a lot of protective gear can make certain actions challenging.
Each additional layer of armor increases Agility-based difficulties by
+4 or more, depending on the joint ﬂexibility of the pieces.

* Syntheleather mesh: +1D: M
* Hard leather: +1D+1: E
* Plastovar: +1D+1: D
* Plasteel: +1D+2: D
* Chain mail: +2D: E
* Light Kevlar: +2D+1: D
* Plate mail: +3D: M
* Bulletproof vest: +3D: M
* Reﬂec (against energy only): +3D: H
* Flak jacket: +3D+1: M
* Heavy Kevlar: +3D: D
* Ceramic armor: +3D+1: H

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


### Maximum Damage Resistance Total Option ###


Some characters carry around their own protection, so it doesn't
make much sense to add more to it. The maximum damage resistance
roll a character can have is 6D before adding any negative modiﬁers,
Character Points, or Fate Points but including Strength, protective
gear and abilities, and other modiﬁers. Any Armor Value above this
is ignored. Gamemasters may adjust this depending on how effective
they want protective gear to be.


Weapons
-------

### Terminology ###

Damage: Damage is the amount of harm a weapon does. Melee,
thrown, and those missile weapons relying a person's strength to determine 
their power are enhanced by the character's Strength Damage (see
page 74 to determine the die code). Weapons affected by strength have
a "+" in front of their damage die code. Note that the damage is based
on the weapon ﬁring a single shot (bullet, bolt, etc.). See the "Combat
Options" chapter for guidelines on other rates of ﬁre.

Range: This factor takes into account that the weapon will be
less effective the farther it is from the target. The values given are the
maximums, in meters, for Short, Medium, and Long ranges.

For generated values, roll the character's Strength or lift. The modiﬁer
after "STR" indicates the number to take from or add onto the total.
These totals, in meters, determines the ranges the character can throw
the item. If the total becomes zero or less because of the modiﬁer, then
the character cannot throw the item to that range. (Gamemaster who
prefer straight values should multiply the die code in Strength or lift
by 4, then add the pips to get the "STR" value.)

Ammunition: The number of bullets or projectiles that the weapon
holds. The entries for explosives or weapons used in close combat don't
need or include this.


Categories of Firearms
----------------------

There are a lot of weapons listed here. Why would you not simply
select the weapon with the highest damage score? In addition to the
social ramiﬁcations, a weapon's range, its ammo use and capacity, and
its various "ﬁre options" are all things an adventurer needs to consider.
The following explanations should help.

### Handguns ###

Handguns are small and comparatively light, and usually easily
concealable. In most game settings, pistols are readily available and
not illegal. In fact, in most modern game settings, they will be the
weapon of choice for most adventurers -- carrying a handgun is a lot
less conspicuous than a submachine gun or an assault riﬂe.

These weapons are for close-up work. Even though most pistol
rounds will travel a good distance with a high-impact velocity, most
pistols have a fairly short effective range.

Most pistols hold between six and 15 rounds. Pistols may always
ﬁre once per round, and twice if they are semi-automatic and the user
shoots at the same target (with the single ﬁre as multi combat option).
Pistols cannot ﬁre full auto -- a pistol that can do that is classiﬁed as
a submachine gun in these rules.


### Riﬂes ###

Single-shot riﬂes, such as most hunting riﬂes, are also common, and
not overly regulated on most worlds. True, they attract considerable
attention in cities, but most small towns don't have a problem with
them -- and they are perfectly acceptable in the wilderness.

Riﬂes tend to have longer effective ranges than any other weapon
(barring the machine gun), and they have slightly better damage die
codes than pistols, mainly because (in general) they maintain better
velocities over distance and are capable of ﬁring larger rounds.

While some riﬂes only hold single bullets, most adventurers will
have riﬂes that hold six, nine, or even 15 rounds. Usually, higher damage
score riﬂes hold fewer rounds, since the bullets are larger.
As with pistols, riﬂes may ﬁre once per round or twice if they are
semi-automatic (using the single ﬁre as multi combat option). They
cannot ﬁre on full auto, since that is the province of assault riﬂes.


### Shotguns ###

Like riﬂes, shotguns are considered "civilian" weapons and are
not usually overly regulated. They attract a lot of attention in highly
populated areas, but only if they are out in the open.

The range on a shotgun is less than that of a riﬂe, but shotguns are
slightly better"up-close" weapons. They usually shoot a spray of pellets,
rather than a single round. So, they are more accurate at shorter ranges
and they do quite a bit of damage as well. However, because the spray of
pellets scatters quickly, they do not have the range of regular riﬂes.

There are many single-shot and pump-action shotguns available.
The "double-barrel" shotgun can gain the single ﬁre as multi bonus by
ﬁring both barrels at once.


### Submachine Guns ###

These ﬁrearms fall into the "military/criminal" area. Submachine
guns are illegal in most populated areas, and they attract attention
anywhere. They are very effective weapons for adventurers, but can
often cause more trouble than they are worth.

While most submachine guns hold around 20 or 30 rounds, their
rate of ﬁre is so high that they unload themselves quickly. A burst
ﬁres about one-ﬁfth of the weapon's magazine, while a full auto shot
discharges the whole clip. Even so, a full auto shot usually settles most
differences between parties quite quickly.

Submachine guns may ﬁre at up to three targets per round.


### Assault Riﬂes ###
Seldom available in many populated areas, they are heavily regulated 
and usually only brandished by military organizations. They are
marginally more acceptable than submachine guns (since they are less
concealable), but they cause the same types of problems. Their 
ammunition is usually expensive and harder to get than normal riﬂe ammo.
These weapons are like a mix between submachine guns and riﬂes.

They are larger and heavier than either type of weapon, making them
bulky to carry, but also more accurate than submachine guns over longer
ranges. Characters may ﬁre them in bursts of three to ﬁve rounds (burst
ﬁre as single), single-shot, full auto, or single ﬁre as multi. They may ﬁre
at up to three targets per round.


###Machine Guns ###

These are truly"military only" weapons. A character with a machine
gun had better keep it under wraps everywhere except the wilderness.
It causes trouble and attention. Machine guns are usually hard to get,
expensive, and their ammunition is not readily available.

These are heavy weapons usually ﬁred from a vehicle mount or
a bi- or tripod. A single character seldom can ﬁre the weapon while
holding it. As a result, reverse the range difficulties when using a
machine gun (so that Point Blank is +10, Short is +5, Medium is 0,
and Long is -5), since they are hard to swing around in a tight arc to
Here is a sampling of ﬁrearm accessories that can make certain
"bring to bear" on a close, dodging target. They may ﬁre at up to three
targets per round.

Machine guns are almost always belt or drum-fed, meaning they
can hold hundreds of rounds. However, many machine guns have cyclic
rates of over 500 rounds per minute. They seldom fire on anything but
full auto, unless they are loaded with only one round. (Because of their 
long range and high damage die codes, they are often used by snipers).


### Energy Weapons ###

In most science-fiction settings, energy weapons are easier to come by 
than their slug-throwing counterparts. (Of course, actual availability 
is up to the game master.) They also generally have the beneﬁt of a 
light, disposable or rechargeable clip, versus the slug thrower's need 
for large amounts of individual projectiles.

The ranges of energy weapons are comparable to their solid projectile
counterparts, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter depending on the
design. Those relying on integrated power packs offer three or more
times as many shots than a similar nonenergy weapon. Handguns and
riﬂes may ﬁre single shot (at up to three targets) or single ﬁre as multi,
unless otherwise noted in their description.


### Types of Energy Weapons ###

Blaster pistols and riﬂes strip particles from their barrels and 
hyperaccelerate them toward their target. Their distinctive reports come 
from the sonic boom of the particles, and the results are messy. The barrel
must be replaced about once for every ﬁve power pack replacements.
Personal blasters may only ﬁre once per round (having a longer than
normal recharging time).

Accelerated and focused photons form the ﬁrepower of the large
class of weapons known as lasers, which cause damage through the
application of intense heat.

Plasma riﬂes and pistols ﬁre a bust of super-heated gas. The clip
contains the gas and a disposable battery to charge the electromagnetic
pulse of the weapon. These weapons may ﬁre single shot, single ﬁre as
multi, or full auto.


### Miscellaneous Firearms ###

Some science ﬁction settings also offer a few other unusual pieces
of ranged weaponry. Generally, most places consider these to be illegal
or, at minimum, deserving of extreme regulation.

Gyrojet riﬂes and pistols ﬁre miniature rockets with explosive
warheads. The propellant is in the tiny rocket itself, which gives them
a long range and high damage from impact and explosion.

Needler riﬂes and pistols use electromagnetism to ﬁre tiny steel
darts at hypersonic speeds. They do not do as much damage as some
other weapons, but have huge ammunition capacities. These weapons
may also ﬁre single shot, single ﬁre as multi, or full auto.


Multiple Targets
----------------

Users of weapons that may fire at multiple targets in a round do not 
gain the damage bonus related to the weapon setting when firing at
multiple targets.


Firearm Accessories
--------------------

Here is a sampling of firearm accessories that can make certain weapons 
more effective.

* Gyrostabilization: This can be built into any personal or heavy
weapon (except hand grenades) and provides synchronized stabilization 
for the wielder. The unit supplies that small amount of extra
bracing that often makes the difference between a hit and a 
miss (+1D to hit at any range). This gyrostabilization bonus is not 
used if the character aims ﬁrst; aiming provides better stabilization 
than the gyro can. Cost: 10% of base weapon cost or +1 to the price 
difficulty.

* Laser Sight: This can be mounted on almost any projectile or 
energy-ﬁring weapon (hand grenades are out). The laser sight projects 
a small, coherent spot of light that can be seen by the weapon's user, 
though after 100 meters, the character using the weapon must be 
equipped with binoculars or other visual aids (like the telescopic 
sight). The spot helps the character ﬁring the weapon to
see where the round is going to go (+1D to ﬁrearms roll).
There are only two disadvantages to the laser sight: (1) certain gases
can refract the beam and (2) if the character uses the sight to aim, the
target may see the little laser-light as well and be alerted. (Someone
who suspects she's being targeted may make a search attempt with a
+1D bonus to the roll to spot the location of the hidden attacker during
the round in which the aim takes place. The difficulty is the attacker's
attempt to hide.) When using this sight to ﬁre at anything other than
Point-Blank or Short range, the character must take an action to aim
or forfeit the bonus of the laser sight. (The character gets the aiming
bonus.) It is simply too hard to see the "dot" at Medium or Long range
with a "quick shot." Cost: Easy.

* Quick-Draw Holster: A favorite among gunslingers, the springloaded 
quick-draw holster is only available for nonbulky pistol weapons
or melee weapons. With this holster, drawing the weapon does not count
as an action, so characters may perform it in the same turn as using the
weapon without penalty. In addition, when the character engages in a
"quick-draw" contest, she can add 1D to her initiative. It does not provide
any special initiative bonus during normal combat. Cost: Easy.

* Telescopic Sight: Only an advantage at Medium or Long range,
the standard telescopic sight is equipped to make seeing the weapon's
target at those ranges much easier (+2 to hit at Medium and Long
ranges). Individual scopes are ﬁtted to different weapons -- so a weapon
with a long range of 250 meters would have a different sight than a
weapon with a 1,000-meter range. The scope can be adjusted slightly,
but the maximum range is always just a little more than the weapon's
maximum effective range. When using this sight on a weapon, the
character must aim to get the bonus (though the character also gets
the aiming bonus as well). Cost: Easy.

* UV Sight and Scope: Much more expensive, this "SNS" combination is 
also much more deadly than the laser sight. The character using
the weapon has a UV scope mounted on the weapon (or, less likely, is
wearing ultraviolet goggles) and can see the UV laser dot (+1D to 
ﬁrearms roll). No one else can (unless they, also, are so equipped). The UV
scope can also be used to track the dot at long distances. This sighting
combination only affects shots taken at Medium or Long range, and
only if the character takes the time to aim the weapon. The character
gets the aiming bonus as well. Cost: Moderate.

### Special Ammunition ###

Slug thrower ammunition comes in a few varieties using
metallic cases. The cases can be reused by reloading them
with the slug, powder, and primer. In addition to standard
bullets, there are two other types.

* Flechette rounds are small, tightly packed slivers of metal
designed to damage armor, including dermal plate. When using
ﬂechette rounds, add 2 to the damage of the weapon.

* AP bullets are used to pierce armor. When a character is
using AP rounds against a target wearing armor with an armor
value of +2 or more, increase the damage of the AP round by
+4. If the character is not wearing the minimum armor requirement, 
then subtract 2 from the damage of the round.

### Reloading ###

Reloading a case requires the ﬁrearms repair skill, and it
cannot be done untrained (at least one additional pip in the
skill). With proper equipment, a character can reload about
50 rounds every hour. When a character attempts to reload a
bullet, he generates one total per clip (Character Points may
be spent). The standard difficulty number is 13.

Reloading has both beneﬁts and drawbacks. It is possible,
by adding an extra measure of propellant or two, to improve
damage value or accuracy of a bullet. Bonuses to accuracy are
added to the ﬁrearms skill total when in combat. The process
can also increase the likelihood of misﬁres.

When generating the total, consult the following chart
to determine the effects, which relate to all bullets reloaded
in the same clip.


### Reloading Success Chart ###

*Skill Roll > Difficulty: Bonus: Drawback*

* 0-4: None: Misﬁre on 1, 2, or 3 on the Wild Die
* 5-10: +2 accuracy OR +2 damage: Misﬁre on 1 or 2 on the Wild Die
* 11-15: +1D accuracy OR +1D damage: Misﬁre on Critical Failure
* 16+: +1D+1 accuracy OR +1D+1 damage: None

Explosives
----------

Explosives, the most well known of which are grenades, are one-use
weapons that bear the same stigma as the machine gun, but they are
easier to conceal. However, using or brandishing a grenade or explosive
will always attract unwanted attention.

Using an explosive can get tricky. Even though a thrown grenade
uses the throwing skill to hit, the character using the grenade should
not actually be aiming at a person but, rather, a place. Grenades do not,
typically, explode on contact -- they explode after their fuse (usually
three seconds) burns up and they damage anything in a given area. When
throwing at a speciﬁc area, refer to the "Grenade Targeting" chart. If the
grenade misses, the gamemaster determines where it lands.

Ranges for explosives and grenades represent how far they can be
thrown, which is based on the Strength or lift of the character modiﬁed
by an additional value. As with other weapons, accuracy decreases as
the distance to the target location increases.

Explosives also have an additional game mechanic: the burst radius.
Anyone caught within the burst radius must take damage; the farther
a character is from the center of the blast, the less damage she takes.

Three values, in meters, are given for each burst radius. Compare the
attack roll to target the explosive against the defense total of characters
not at ground zero; those who have a defense total greater than the
targeting roll managed to dive for cover or protect themselves from the
burst. Characters between zero and the ﬁrst value take full damage. Those
between the ﬁrst and second values take half damage. Anyone between
the second and third values take quarter damage. (Round all fractions
up.) Characters farther away than the third value are relatively safe.

Characters who haven't taken their turn yet have a chance of getting
out of the way of the blast. (Here's another instance of being able to
move up a turn.) Technically, normal movement might do it, but this
is a combat situation -- the grenade thrower is timing his throw to
catch a target in the blast radius.

The target has to beat a difficulty to get out of the blast radius of an
explosive. The base difficulty is 15 versus a dodge or Agility roll, but the
character has to get out of up to three zones of the blast radius.

A character who meets the difficulty exactly moves one blast radius
zone away from where the explosive landed or was set off. For every
four points above the difficulty, the character moves one more blast
radius zone away. So, a character at ground zero (and thus in zone 1)
of a grenade explosion needs to beat a difficulty of 23 to get completely
out of the range, while a character in zone 3 requires only a 15.


Types of Explosives
-------------------

Concussion grenades create a powerful shock wave when they explode, 
designed to stun targets. 

Dynamite is commonly used in mining, road construction, and other
places where relatively cheap, quick destruction is needed. A blasting
cap, fuse, or timing device is needed to set off this nitroglycerin-based
explosive. Dynamite comes in sticks.

When fragmentation grenades explode, they send shrapnel out in
all directions.

Plastic explosives can be formed like putty. The explosive is inert until
an electrical current runs through it (which means that an electrical
blasting cap is needed to set it off ). Plastic explosives are small (and
easily transportable), and can be used to open an otherwise reluctant
door (such as to a safe). About two ounces generates the damage for
plastic explosives.

Tear gas and smoke grenades do not explode. Instead, they release
their contents through holes in a canister. The cloud they create
quickly ﬁlls an area of 9.5 square meters. Armor provides no 
protection against this kind of attack, though a gas mask will. Both 
tear gas and smoke grenades give all within the blast area a -1D 
penalty to all Agility, Mechanical, and sight-based Perception rolls.

White phosphorus grenades create intense heat when they explode. Not 
only do they do a base damage, they also ignite all ﬂammable material 
in the area of effect, doing an additional 4D in damage each round it 
continues to burn (which can last several rounds).

### Explosives ###

*Damage: Short Range (in meters): Medium Range: Long Range: Price*

* Concussion grenade: 6D (stun): STR-4: STR-3: STR+3†: E
* Dynamite (per stick): 5D: STR-3: STR-2: STR+1†: VE

* Smoke grenade, tear gas: ‡: STR-4: STR-3: STR+3†: E
* White phosphorus grenade: 6D+2: STR-4: STR-3: STR+3†: E

Range equals the total in meters. Modiﬁer is added or subtracted from 
the total generated. 

Smoke grenades and tear gas give all within burst area a -1D penalty 
to all Agility, Mechanical, and sight-based Perception rolls.

Muscle-Powered Weapons
----------------------

Muscle-powered weapons include all those that depend upon a
character's strength to get them to their target. Instead of having 
their damage die codes listed as a single number, muscle-powered 
weapons have damage adds.


Missile and Thrown Weapons
--------------------------

One beneﬁt of missile and thrown weapons is their quiet operation
and fewer government regulations on ownership. All such weapons
take an action to reload, either to notch another arrow or pull out
another dart. Generally, characters may reload in the same round as
ﬁring or throwing, except crossbows, which require bolt placement
and string cranking.

### Missile and Thrown Weapons ###

*Missle Weapon: Damage: Short (Range): Medium: Long: Price*

* Blowgun and dart: 1D2: 10: 40: 100: VE
* Bow, composite and arrow +3D+1: 10: 60: 250: M
* Crossbow,: wrist-mounted and dart: 4D: 10: 25: 50: M


*Thrown Weapon: Damage: Short (Range): Medium: Long: Price*

* Dart: +0: STR STR+1 STR+2 VE
* Throwing dagger: +1D: 5: 10: 15: E
* Throwing star (shuriken): +1D: 5: 10: 15: VE

Price is for ﬁring part of weapon; arrows, bolts, or darts priced 
separately.

Blowguns commonly shoot poison darts; poison damage is in addition to
damage listed above.

Melee Weapons
-------------

Most muscle-powered weapons are melee weapons. Swords, knives,
brass knuckles, and clubs are all examples. All of these weapons require
melee combat to use. Gamemasters may allow such simple ones as sticks
to be used untrained with only the Agility attribute.

Edged or pointed weapons do half damage when used to bludgeon
instead of cut.


Improvised Weapons
------------------

When a character's up against something ugly and angry, and his
favorite gun's back at his hideout, he grabs whatever he can to get the
job done.

That means that gamemasters aren't always going to ﬁnd established
game mechanics for what their players want to use as weapons. When
this happens, the best way to handle the situation is use the mechanics 
of something similar. Most items will either be like a dagger (such
as a broken bottle) or a club (such as a table leg). Then modify the
damage based on how sharp or heavy the improvised weapon is to the
comparison weapon.

Improvised weapons always use either melee combat or throwing,
and they always receive an improvised weapon modiﬁer to the combat
difficulty of +5 or more. On a card-played setback or a rolled Critical
Failure when wielding the item, the improvised weapon breaks, the
user hurts himself, or both -- the greater the roll fails, the worse the
situation is. (If the user ends up hurting himself, use only the weapon
bonus -- do not include the user's Strength Damage -- to determine
the amount of damage done.)

Generally, improvised weapons may only be relied on a few times
before they break (regardless of whether a Critical Failure or a setback
occurred while using it), though ones designed to take abuse -- such
as a heavy metal pipe or a screwdriver -- will survive the
battle and continue to be serviceable.

* Katana (large): +3D: M
* Knife (survival), dagger: +1D: VE-E
* Machete: +1D+2: E

* Sword, energized broad (large): +4D: D
* Sword, short: +1D+2: E
* Sword, two-handed (large): +3D+1: E
* Tonfa: +1D+2: E

Large weapons are longer than 60 centimeters and thus
incur the unwieldy weapon modiﬁer of +5 (if using that).

Note: The quarterstaff allows user to attack at Point Blank or up 
to 2 meters away at Short range; incurs unwieldy weapon modiﬁer of +5.

Planetary Vehicles
------------------

The table lists a number of conveyances commonly found
on planets and moons. With land vehicles, the prices are
for wheeled versions. Should hovercraft versions exist, up
the price by one level and the Maneuverability by +1D.
Hovercraft have the beneﬁt of being able to handle a wider
variety of terrain, including shallow pools of water, with ease,
at the cost of a higher initial price and greater maintenance
difficulty (+3 to all vehicle repair difficulties). Both wheeled
and hovercraft have the same move; the difference is in how
well they can travel over different terrain.

This section introduces a few terms unique to means
of conveyance:

* Move: This is approximately cruising speed.
* Passengers: The number of people, including the crew,
  that the vehicle can carry. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the
  number of crew needed to properly operate the vehicle is one.
* Toughness: This is the vehicle's base damage resistance die code.
  It can also be used as a reasonable measure of the amount of damage
  it can inﬂect. It may not be modiﬁed by spending Character or Fate
  Points on it.
*  Maneuverability: An indication of how easy the vehicle is to handle.
  Stunts are easier to perform in vehicles with higher die codes than in
  those with lower ones. The Maneuverability die code is added to the
  driver's or pilot's appropriate skill total when that person is
  attempting to do something fancy. (Vehicle stunts are further 
  explained in the "Movement" chapter.)


Vehicle Weapons
---------------

Occasionally, characters might ﬁnd it necessary to mount or have
mounted weapons on their planetary vehicles. All of these weapons
require the gunnery skill to use them properly. Additionally, a character
who must ﬁre a weapon and maneuver the vehicle incurs a multi-action
penalty.

Each weapon may ﬁre once per round, because they need some
time to recharge.

All weapons increase the cost by +5 to the price difficulty. For an
additional cost, the vehicle can be installed with a weapons computer
that improves the gunnery roll by +1D for each +3 increase in cost.

* Blaster Cannon: damage 3D; range 200/500/1500
* Laser Cannon: damage 5D; range 250/750/1750
* Rocket Launcher: damage 6D+2; 400/1500/3000

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

This chapter offers a simple ship design system to get you started on
creating your own space-faring vessels, including three example ships.

Using the Ship Design System

The ﬁrst order of business in making a spaceship is deciding on the
ship's purpose.Will it be a small in-system shuttle craft, or a cargo freighter?
From this, you can jot down a few ideas on crew complement, number
of passengers, cargo space, types of drives, armor, and weapons. Then,
with notes in hand and a copy of the Ship Design Log (found at the end
of this chapter), go through each section, marking your decisions on the
log. The worksheets on the right side of the page can help you ﬁgure out
the ﬁnal totals for various important aspects of the ship.

### Freeform Ship Design ###

If you think this sort of ship design is too rigid, you should
feel free to ignore the mathematics and choose whatever
options you decide best meet the concept of the ship you have
in mind. (If you're a player, you should get your gamemaster's
permission before attempting this -- just in case she has some
other ideas in mind.)

Determining the Price Difﬁculty
-------------------------------

After you have found the total cost of all components you're including 
in the ship, divide the number by 10,000 (round up) and add 20
to determine the price difficulty.


Shape and Size
--------------

For purposes of introducing this system, all ships are ellipsoid, or
ﬂattened egg-shaped, vessels several meters deep and about twice as
long as they are wide. Using a system of modules with deﬁned area,
you can create just about anything from a ﬁghter to a pleasure yacht.
A nearly inﬁnite number of variations on putting modules together
exists, and those who become comfortable with designing basic models
should move on to adding complexity to their creations.

All ships have inertial compensators. These incredibly sturdy
machines placed throughout a ship's hull exert a strong but shortwaved 
gravity ﬁeld in the area. This keeps the ship from being torn
apart whenever the pilot makes high-g turns -- and it makes life a lot
easier for the crew as well. Perceived gravity is simply an extra function
of the system that simulates normal Human gravity forces (things will
fall toward the ﬂoor area when you drop them).

For ellipsoid vehicles, add together the number of area units of all
of your modules and divide by 2. Should you wish to arrange your
modules in some other fashion, use graph paper and designate each
square as one meter on a side. Arrange your modules however you
wish, making sure that each one takes up the required number of units
and that each module connects directly to another module. Count the
squares from one end to another to determine the length.


Module Descriptions
-------------------

Using this modularized list, you should be able to quickly create a
ship that suits the needs of your crew and any passengers.

Each square meter of the vessel's interior is assumed to be three
meters high -- enough room for most sentient species to stand upright
(this, by the way, includes ceiling and ﬂoor panels, cables, and conduits,
so the actual "open space" is a little less -- about 2.5 meters).

Figure that each square meter of life-supported area masses one
half of a metric ton. This approximation is a good average between
empty areas (which should have very little mass) and more complex
areas like the heating and cooling, oxygen and water recycling, and
food-producing equipment.

If you need larger area, simply buy the module several more times to
accommodate the desired number of people. For instance, some ships
will want a bridge large enough for the entire crew. If the number of
crewmen is ﬁve, then buy the standard bridge ﬁve times.

Buying additional modules also serves as a good way to increase the
luxuriousness of your vessel. The modules described herein are created
with the least amount of wasted space possible. If you want your crew
to have plenty of area to move around and stretch their legs, simply
design the ship as if you wanted to support more people. For instance,
you could buy two "one-person rooms" to make a single "state room"
with a couch, chair, personal entertainment system, etc.

The accompanying table lists each type of module, the number of
people it supports, the number of area units it requires, its mass, and
its cost. All ﬁgures are per inclusion of that type of module.


Life Support Equipment
----------------------

The modules do not include supplies (just the hardware); the ship's
owner needs to purchase them separately. The accompanying chart
provides information about the cost of supplies. Initial installation
costs ﬁve credits per 0.2 area added.

To get the correct ﬁgure for breathable atmosphere, add the number
of people that the total number of modules support (regardless of
whether people will be in those rooms all of the time), then multiply
that by the values for the breathable atmosphere unit. Multiply this
by the number of months' worth of atmosphere needed.

For food processing, multiply the number of people in the crew
plus the maximum number of additional passengers (not the total
number of people the modules could hold) by the values for the food
processing unit. Multiply this by the number of months' worth of
food required.

The exact nature of the breathable atmosphere and food depends
on the type of crew the ship has.


Life-Supporting Modules
-----------------------

### Airlock ###

The airlocks on cargo freighters and the like are generally
provided so that a crew can go extra-vehicular without forcing everyone
inside to put on environmental suits. Most are little more than two
meters square and are sealed with doors of the same basic Toughness
as the ship itself. Note that airlocks are not designed to be lived in
-- they can hold and support up to ﬁve people (per unit), but they do
not provide food and water or sleeping areas.


### Bridge/Duty Station ###

The standard bridge or duty station contains
a cushioned swivel chair bolted to the ﬂoor with a computer interface
and display panel in front of it. Additional duty stations may be included
by adding this module for the appropriate number of people.

The captain commands the ship's crew from the bridge. In ships
with only one crew, the captain serves all duties and runs the entire
ship from the bridge. In larger ships, the duty stations that control
various functions (such as sensors or weapons) may be within the
bridge, scattered throughout the ship, or both.

Most bridges and duty stations come with rations of food and water
(in processors) for crew members who want to live or spend considerable 
time at their station. The chairs recline slightly so that the crew
can sleep at their stations.


### Bridge/Duty Station Upgrades to Sensors and Communications ###

Even the most primitive spaceships have some sort of sensor 
equipment -- even if that equipment amounts to a window. In most cases,
the ship has scanners and programs of differing quality. Similarly, a
ship's communication equipment can vary greatly depending on the
components installed.

The bridge and duty stations come with basic equipment that
gives no aid to the user's basic abilities. Sensors and communication
equipment take up no additional space (it's already ﬁgured into the
design), but they do require a bridge or duty station module. To
provide better sensor or processing programs, see "Module Upgrades"
later in this chapter.


### Bunks, Communal ###

These are four bunks stacked two high with
a minimum of space between each set. The room also features a single
toilet room and a sectional storage cabinet for personal effects on the
opposite side. The room has ration processors.


### Coldsleep Module ###

Coldsleep modules are self-contained, selfpowered, computer-regulated 
"sleeper-coffins." A unit of cold-coffins can usually operate for 25 
years after the ship's power is shut down. The beds provide 
nutrients (at a reduced rate) directly into the sleeper's system.


### Hallway ###

Purchased in one-meter-square increments, some ships
use hallways to separate various rooms and allow their occupants or
users privacy from others moving about the ship.


### Inﬁrmary ###

This fully equipped two-bed hospital has an array of
medications and medical equipment, including computerized health
monitors and equipment for performing surgeries.


### Lounge, Basic ###

The basic lounge is simply a long table and chairs for the crew 
with a little space to stretch or have discussions. It does not
include entertainment systems or the like, though there is room to mount
small units in the walls if desired. Food processing is standard.


### Lounge, Deluxe ###

As above but the deluxe lounge includes audio and visual entertainment 
system, snack processor, and any other amenities the crew desires.


### Passenger Seating ###

This area contains four seats designed to hold
passengers for short hops (less than 10 hours). The module also has a
large view screen (the contents of which the captain controls), a limited
snack dispenser, and a single-person toilet room.

### Room, Two-Person ###

This dormitory-style room contains two
bunked beds, a single toilet room, two small desks, and two narrow
lockers. Food processors are standard. Noncoms usually share twoperson rooms.


### Room, One-Person ###

As above but designed for a single person.
Officers, the captain, or high-ranking crew who spend a lot of time
on board usually have a room of their own.

### Workroom ###

This is a generic term for any sort of area dedicated to
such things as repair rooms, kitchens (for nonprocessed food), or even
laundry services. Note that the number of people is the amount of persons 
that can reasonably work in this area, though it may service many,
many more. Workrooms are sometimes equipped with food processors
and sleeping areas (especially on independent ships), though this is not
standard (the cost remains, however, virtually the same).

### Life-Supporting Modules ###

*Module: Cost: Number of People: Area Units: Mass (tons)*

* Airlock: 300: 5: 4: 2
* Bridge: 100: 1: 4: 2
* Bunks, communal: 900: 5: 20: 10
* Coldsleep module: 200: 1: 1: 0.5
* Inﬁrmary: 1,500: 3: 18: 9
* Lounge, basic: 1,500: 5: 30: 15
* Lounge, deluxe: 3,000: 5: 36: 18
* Passenger seating: 300: 4: 6:3
* Room, one-person: 500: 1: 10: 5
* Room, two-person: 700: 2: 14: 7

When determining area of life support equipment, multiply 0.2 by 
the number of units (any combination), rounding down. It's
otherwise integrated into the life-supporting modules.

Cargo Modules
-------------

Cargo space covers all extra open areas within a spaceship. This
includes areas for portage and equipment, parking for vehicles or small
ships, and so on. Life support must be purchased separately, at a rate
equivalent to one person for every four area units (round up).


### Basic sections ###

They may have walls, doors, and power couplings,
but basic sections are mostly designed for holding large amounts of 
everchanging goods in many different sizes and masses. Most freighters and
interplanetary haulers have thousands of tons of basic cargo space.


### Segmented ###

This cargo space is generally designed for ships that
will be hauling the same kinds of cargo repeatedly. Ships that haul
livestock, vehicles (that don't require power), or other stock most
often have segmented cargo compartments. When building a ship, the
designer should be able to divide up the cargo area as he sees ﬁt, within
reason. This can include multiple gantries and walkways, cranes and
lift systems, etc. Automated systems for off loading and more sophisticated 
devices will have to be paid for, but portable lifts and simpler
equipment are standard.


### Specialized ###

These cargo areas include vehicle launch platforms,
hangars, automatic ammo bays, or any other space dedicated to a speciﬁc
function. These are by far the most complex and costliest cargo spaces,
and always include multiple power coupling systems, terminals connected 
to the ship's computer, and any other amenities that contribute
to the section's purpose.


### Bulk Space (basic) ###

Empty cargo areas are termed bulk space. They
include simple power outlets and cables for bolting down stock.


### Hangar (specialized) ###

A hangar holds a ﬁghter-sized craft and takes
up about 60 cubic meters. It includes room for minor maintenance.


### Launch Bay (specialized) ###

This bay can launch a single ship at a
time and takes up 255 cubic meters. It includes ﬂight control booths,
terminals, guidance systems, exterior doorways, and all other devices
necessary to send and receive spacecraft.


### Livestock Bay (segmented) ###

Ten large animals (up to half a ton
each) can live comfortably in this 90-cubic-meter bay. This includes
perceived gravity and atmospheric controls.


### Pod Bay (specialized) ###

An escape pod, which can hold up ﬁve
people, takes up about 12 cubic meters of space with all of its dedicated 
terminals and rescue-courier launchers. The escape pod includes
a distress beacon and enough food and breathable atmosphere to
keep the occupants alive for six weeks. It has not controls. (Food and
breathable atmosphere need on be purchased separately, and they
cannot be upgraded.)


### Vehicle Bay (specialized) ###

This is a small (24 cubic meters) garage
designed to house and secure a normal-sized land vehicle. The crew
should buy additional tools and fuels as desired.


Energy Unit Requirements
------------------------

Add together the total metric tonnage of the modules, including
the tonnage from life-support equipment. Divide this number by 5
and round up. This is the number of energy units these areas need to
ﬁlter and recycle oxygen, provide heat and light, and generate artiﬁcial
and perceived gravity.


Module Upgrades
---------------

Ships can offer a variety of computer programs that enhance their
crew members' innate skills. Likewise, workrooms and vehicle bays
may have built-in equipment to help with maintenance, diagnostics, or
whatever function the room is designed to serve. These upgrades give
their users a +1 pip bonus to the relevant skill use with an installation
cost of 500 credits and a energy unit draw of one per pip. (Remember
that a bonus of three pips equals a bonus of +1D.)

Those with neural-jacked crew can accommodate them by including
a cyber interface. For a cost of 2,000 credits per interface, this allows a
character with a neural jack to directly connect to the computer. The
captain may restrict access to select users.

Drives
------

Drives power the ship and move it through space, however the
gamemaster wants to describe the technology. Ships have two types
of drives: in-system (or sublight) and interstellar.


In-System Drives
----------------

Though the bulk of the in-system drive is housed in a single section
of the ship, a series of maneuvering jets and retros along the ship allow
it to turn in frictionless space. A basic system provides 0D in Maneuverability. 
Better or additional thrusters increase the Maneuverability.
Each thruster takes up 0.5 area units and weighs one ton, whether
additional or upgrading an existing one. Each unit or upgrade costs
300 credits. They must be bought in pairs. Each set or improvement
adds one pip to the Maneuverability rating, with an energy draw of
two units. (Remember that there are three pips in one die.)

The smallest in-system drive covers ﬁve area units, has a mass of ﬁve
metric tons, and has a cost of 6,000 credits. It gives a space Move of
one space unit per round with an energy unit draw of three. It provides
25 energy units to the ship. (This does not include the Move energy
requirements; those are taken from this pool.) For each additional
Move increase of 1, the cost goes up by 1,000 credits and the energy
requirement goes up by three. Adding more power increases the size
by one additional area unit and two additional tons for each extra 15
energy units, with a cost increase of 2,000 for each upgrade. Improving
the power of the drive does not increase the Move.

### Atmosphere Movement Rate ###


*Atmosphere Move: Kilometers per Hour*

* 50: 130
* 100: 260
* 150: 430
* 200: 560
* 250: 750
* 300: 850
* 350: 1,000
* 400: 1,150
* 450: 1,300
* 500: 1,450
* 550: 1,600
* 600: 1,750
* 650: 1,850
* 700: 2,000
* 750: 2,150
* 800: 2,300

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Atmospheric Capability
----------------------

A ship's atmospheric speed generally equals its capabilities in space.
To determine the base atmospheric Move, multiply the ship's space
Move by 50. Then use the table to translate that value to kilometers
per hour. Find the closest atmosphere speed to get the corresponding
number of kilometers per hour. Gamemasters may decide that ships
over a certain number of modules may never enter the atmosphere.


Interstellar Drives
-------------------

Perhaps the least understood and most internally valuable of a
starship's components is its interstellar drive. This drive allows 
spacefaring vessels to make the miraculous leaps of distance that can shape
the universe. Some gamemasters may disallow these drives, preferring
instead to focus adventures on a single system. For everyone else, here
are guidelines for adding them to the ship.

The interstellar drive must be located next to the in-system drive,
because the interstellar drive is actually an extension of that system,
drawing on the same power source but using it in a vastly different way
(one determined by the gamemaster). Interstellar drives are ranked by
ratings. Interstellar drives with low rating numbers increase the amount
of time it takes to reach a destination, while high ones decrease it. The
lowest rating a ship with an interstellar drive can have is 0.1. It costs 5,000
credits. It takes up two area units, with a mass of ﬁve tons and an energy
requirement of 10. For each additional 0.1 in rating, add one area unit,
three tons of mass, 10 energy units, and 5,000 credits to the price.


Weapons
-------

Nearly every ship the players' characters encounter in a science-ﬁction
universe has intership weapons on board. Indeed, most space-faring vessels
of any signiﬁcant tonnage at all have at least one weapon built in.

Ship weapons are huge versions, in most cases, of personal and
heavy weapons. The list provides a few of the most common kinds.
Use the accompanying chart for various game characteristics for some
common weapons. The weapon's arc (forward, port side, starboard side,
or rear) needs to be designated. A weapon can be swivel mounted, for
an extra 200 credits and one additional energy unit per additional ﬁre
arc (so, to ﬁre in four directions costs 600 credits -- three extra 
arcs -- and another three energy units).

A ship's computer can aid with ﬁring a weapon. See the "Modules
Upgrade" section for details on improving the ship's computer.
Note that weapons cannot lock on anything less than one space
unit away from the targeting vessel.

### Weapons ###

*Type: Area Units: Mass: Energy: Cost: Ammo: Range (space units): Damage*

* Blaster cannon, small: 1: 2: 13: 10,000: --: 8/25/40: 3D+2
* Laser cannon, medium: 2: 6: 13: 15,000: --: 3/12/25: 7D
* Torpedo launcher: 2: 3: 2: 5,000: 1: 1/3/7: 9D
* Tractor beam projector: 7: 15: 10: 8,000: --: 5/15/30: 2D

Note: Replacement torpedoes cost 1,000 credits; they have negligible mass.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Tractor Beam
------------

A tractor beam allows one ship to pull another one closer to it. (A
small ship can pull itself closer to a large one, while a large one can pull
a smaller one in.) It costs 8,000 credits to install the base module, which
takes up seven area units, draws 10 energy units, and offers a tractor
beam "damage" of 2D. For each additional +1D to the beam, add 4,000
credits, another seven area units, and another 10 energy units.


Hull
----

Once you've ﬁgured out where everything's going, you'll need to
put walls around your collection of modules. Adding a hull does not
increase the vehicle's size, but it does up its mass.

The mass of the bulkheads equals half the mass of the modules for
life support, cargo, life support, drives, and weapons combined (round
up). To ﬁgure out the cost of the bulkheads, multiply the bulkhead
mass by 500 credits.

Then, use the bulkhead's mass to determine its base Toughness by
reading the ﬁgure on the accompanying chart. Round the number of
kilograms down when ﬁguring hull toughness. A ship with a hull mass
of 105 tons has a hull Toughness of 2D+2, not 3D.


Armor
-----

Adding armor to the hull means riveting plates on the outside, using
better materials for the exterior, reinforcing bulkheads, and improving 
the supports. Use the "Hulls" chart to determine how much each
additional pip of armor costs. The maximum amount of armor a ship
can have equals the hull Toughness. (Remember that there are three
pips in one die.) Armor draws no energy. It add a number of kilograms
equal to its cost.

Hull armor (which includes the structure of the ship) needs to be
repaired -- or, more likely, replaced -- when it is damaged.

### Hulls ###

Mass (metric tons): Toughness: Cost per Extra Armor Pip
* 10: 1D: 1,000
* 15: 1D+1: 1,500
* 25: 1D+2: 2,500
* 40: 2D: 4,000
* 60: 2D+1: 6,000
* 100: 2D+2: 10,000
* 150: 3D: 15,000
* 250: 3D+1: 25,000
* 400: 3D+2: 40,000
* 600: 4D: 60,000
* 1000: 4D+1: 100,000
* 1500: 4D+2: 150,000
* 2500: 5D: 250,000
* 4000: 5D+1: 400,000
* 6000: 5D+2: 600,000
* 10,000: 6D: 1 million
* 15,000: 6D+1: 1.5 million
* 25,000: 6D+2: 2.5 million
* 40,000: 7D:4 million
* 100,000: 7D+1:10 million
* 150,000: 7D+2:15 million
* 250,000 or more: 8D: 30 million

Shields
-------

Space vessel shields work very much like hull armor, but have
an additional advantage -- unless the whole system is blown away,
they will usually only need to be ﬁtted with a few new components.
Enough damage can overload them, however; see the "Ship Travel"
chapter for details.

Energy shields are cyclotronic magnetic "bottles" that surround a
ship. The units work in conjunction to form this bubble.
The shield module costs 1.5 times the cost for adding armor, per
pip, but there is no maximum. (A three-pip increase equals one die.)
They have an energy requirement of one unit per pip. Divide the cost
by 10,000 to get the number of tons and by 20,000 (round up) to get
the number of area units.

Shield modules do not add to the ship tonnage when determining
the hull Toughness.


Example Ships
-------------

In these descriptions, "areas" refers to area units, "eu" stands for
"energy units," and "cr" means "credits."

### Light Freighter ###

The workhorse of the mercantile industry, light freighters make
short runs between established and colony worlds. Add some nice paint
to the interior and a ﬂashy name, and this sample ship serves well as
a small yacht. Stock the ship with survey equipment and long-term
supplies, and it becomes a scout ship.

* Modules (24 energy units)

* Total Cost (new): 209,875 credits/Price Difficulty: 41


### Shuttlecraft ###

Used for short jaunts between planets and space stations and other 
orbiting vessels, shuttlecraft can transport people and cargo safely, 
even if not comfortably. Add an additional small blaster cannon and
improve the sensors, and this small ship works well for asteroid mining.

* Modules (3 energy units)

Gamemaster Tips
===============

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

You've made it this far, so you probably don't want even more "rules."
We'll keep this chapter short by offering a list of helpful ideas. If 
you want more guidance, you can ﬁnd more gamemaster resources online
at www.westendgames.com.


The Tips
--------

The most important rule to remember is have fun. All the other
rules in this book are intended to help you worry less about being fair
and more about enjoying developing a fantastic story with your friends.
Here are some ideas to help you with this.

* Before beginning play, skim the rulebook at least once. Refer to
it during the slow parts; make up the difficulties you can't remember
during the exciting scenes.

* You're in charge of the rules, not your players. However, ﬁnd that
balance between being too strict and too lenient. Players need to feel
both challenged and like they accomplish something. If the players
contend you made an error in judgment or presentation, rectify the
matter or make it up to them later.

* You are permitted to place restrictions on character creation if you 
don't think you can come up with obstacles challenging enough for the 
players to run wild.

* Be descriptive. Keep in mind the old rule of "show, don't tell." Make 
your characters and scenes as interesting as you can. Try to work as 
many senses as possible into descriptions. Think about how novelists do
it, and follow their example. (All right, it is possible to overdo 
it -- you'll ﬁgure that out when your players start nodding off.)

* Players know only what you tell them, so don't expect them to use a 
clue later that you don't give them a chance to ﬁnd now.

* Have the players come up with a situation that you know is not in the 
book? Flip to the generic difficulties descriptions (if you've nowhere 
else to start) or the generic modiﬁers (if you already have a difficulty). 
Then pick a number based on the descriptions therein and go with it. You 
can also use this technique to reward player ingenuity.

* Hide the adventure's text or notes, so your players don't know
whether you're changing something. It also increases the level of
suspense and excitement, because they don't know what's going to
happen next.

* Adjust the dice totals to make sure that neither side trounces
the other too fast (although sometimes, that just can't be helped, so
you have to add a few more henchmen, swarms of rats, or a sudden
gas trap).

* Keep a few appropriate ﬁller obstacles handy, like game characteristics 
for mercenaries, rolling boulders, booby traps, critter swarms,
military robots, or whatever, for those times when you need to slow
the players down. Also, have a list of suitable helpers, such as a lost key
in a niche, some convenient med-kits, a reformed thug, or a talkative
child, just in case the players need a hand.

* Don't give your villains more ﬁrepower (or damage-dealing devices
or abilities) than could kill a player's character in a single blow.

* Never let a player's character die unless doing so is particularly
dramatic or heroic. Your characters come and go, but players use only
one or two, so they invest a lot more into their development.

* Give new players leeway, but show players who persistently make bad
choices for their characters that there are consequences to their actions.

* When there's tension between the players, call for a break. It might 
be as simple as getting a snack, or as challenging as reminding the 
players that they are not their characters and they're supposed
to have fun together.

* If you need to encourage players to get into their characters, give 
them immediate, but small, rewards for doing so, such as a bonus to a 
skill roll or a reduction in difficulty.

* Customize your scenarios to the skill levels, character options,
backgrounds, and goals of the players' characters, as well as the kinds 
of things that the players like (particular types of rewards, jokes, 
villains, and so on). The players will feel like they're actually
participating in creating the story, rather than being dragged along.


Adventure Tips
==============

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

In an adventure, characters confront a series of obstacles as they
attempt to reach an ultimate goal. Thus, here's a chapter devoted to
some tips on preparing and running adventures, including obstacle
ideas, rewards, and generic characters.


Designing the Setting
---------------------

This book offers several features common to many, but not all, science 
ﬁction settings. You, as the gamemaster, need to decide what you
want to include before you create your adventures. You'll also need to
let your players know the details, so everyone experiences the game
from a similar viewpoint.

### Aliens ###

Aliens generally allow players to explore one or two key
aspects of the human condition in depth, without actually being bound
by the stereotype of "Human." However, you might decide that, though
Humanity has never met any alien cultures, the Human colonists have
grown so far apart that they've practically become their own species
-- at least culturally.

Of course, if you decide to make interstellar travel prohibitively
costly or even scientiﬁcally impossible, unless the aliens come to the
players, it's likely that they'll never meet another species outside of
their own.

On the ﬂip side, you could decide that Humans are the minority
rather than the norm in your setting.

### Cybernetics ###

Cybernetics allow players to have amazing Special
Abilities. You might decide that you don't want to deal with that, instead
ruling that the setting hasn't reached a level of technology beyond
installing prosthetic devices. Or, you could take a middle ground and
limit the Special Abilities available for installation with cybernetics.

### Metaphysics ###

Extraordinary mental abilities exist as another feature
that can really throw off the fun factor in a game -- or it can open up
new horizons. You decide on how much you feel that Humans and
aliens have tapped into the power of the mind. Perhaps it's strictly
random, and you randomly assign the Metaphysics attribute to one
player in the group after character creation and at no additional cost
(and give everyone else an extra piece of equipment as a consolation
prize). Or you could limit Metaphysics to certain alien species or make
it much more difficult to use than it currently is.

### Space Travel ###

Easy access to interstellar travel means that you'll
need to come up with new planets and, possibly, new alien races. You can
avoid this by deciding that the society has not yet reached that level of
technology. Alternatively, you can limit the speed of interstellar travel,
having it take months or years to reach the next solar system. Pirates
and interstellar police forces are less likely, but divergent cultures are
much more possible.

If you want plenty of contact between various species and solar
systems, you can make space travel faster than the default listed in
this book or use a combination of the default rate plus special artiﬁcial
wormholes or gates.

Scope of the Galaxy. Space can be be big and teeming with life or it
can be sparse and lonely. The more you allow access to easy interstellar
travel, the more fun it is for the players to regularly encounter alien and
Human offshoots, lost civilizations and treasure planets, and pirates
and interstellar military forces.


Creating Adventures
-------------------

Like most games, roleplayers must overcome a series of obstacles
to reach a ﬁnal goal. But in roleplaying games, that combination of
obstacles and goals, called an adventure, takes on the same structure as
a story. Both have an exposition, progressively more difficult challenges
to overcome, a climax, and a resolution. You can use movies, television
shows, novels, or comic books to come up with ideas for adventures,
always remembering that the players get to decide how their characters
react to the given obstacle, instead of being dictated by the writer.
The hurdles the characters must deal with are chosen by you, the
gamemaster. You provide a goal and then present the characters with
a series of problems that prevents them from reaching that objective.
The hindrances can take a variety of forms, from aliens to evil 
technocrats to acid storms to covert government agents, depending on the
particular circumstances of the adventure through which the players'
characters are working.


Types of Adventures
-------------------

The most direct way of creating an adventure is to select the goal
ﬁrst. Once you know the end, you can more easily decide on what types
of obstacles make it interesting for the characters to reach the goal.

* Caught in a Tight Spot: Escape from a situation that could cause
some type of harm to the characters or their allies.

* Contest: The characters must accomplish a predetermined goal more
quickly or more efficiently than everyone else involved in the contest.
Guard Duty: Protect someone or something from harm.

* Foil a Plan: Stop someone else from accomplishing their goal.
Generally, the plan to be foiled has something to do with the destruction 
of a person, place, or thing of importance to the characters or to
the entire world.

* Mystery: The players' characters must discover the truth about a
person, thing, or event.

* The Quest: Locate and retrieve an object or person at the behest of
another. It could be a stolen object, the person kidnapped, or a criminal
who's escaped justice.


Types of Obstacles
------------------

Once you've determined the type of adventure you want to create,
you must divide it up into smaller chunks called scenes, each containing 
one or two obstacles. A scene is triggered by the players' characters'
arrival at a given location or by the passage of time. Once the characters
overcome or bypass the obstacle, they move on to the next scene and one
step closer to the goal of the adventure. Here are a few examples.

* Adverse Conditions: Weather, terrain, and hostile or uncooperative
gamemaster's characters can hamper the characters in accomplishing
the goal.

* Gamemaster's Characters: The people that the player's characters
meet come in handy for all sorts of situations, so much so that there's a
whole section on them in this chapter.

* Combat: In order to continue forward or get to something, the
characters ﬁrst must defeat a creature or villain.

* Diversions: Include extraneous details in setting descriptions or
when the players' characters talk to other people. The details are more
for show than to further the adventure, but they offer some interesting
roleplaying opportunities.

* Information: The players' characters often need to obtain information, 
and you can make this more challenging by making it harder for 
them to ﬁnd (two secretaries to convince instead of one), missing
(part of a needed tablet has been destroyed), in the form of a puzzle or
riddle, from a questionable source, or giving the characters what seems
like a right lead but ends up being to the wrong place. However, make
sure that the information the characters seek really is attainable. Be
careful not to force the players' characters to go through an enormous
amount of trouble based on clues and hints you've given them only to
ﬁnd that their efforts were wasted.

* Multiple Goals: Typically for experienced roleplayers, adding
the rumor of a new goal can force the characters to rearrange their
priorities.

* Restrictions: The characters can't use some of the regular equipment or 
must be certain to perform certain rituals, or there will be dire 
consequences.

* Time Limits: There's nothing like a time limit to speed up a scene.
This kind of obstacle can take the form of limited supplies, limited
ammunition, or a set amount of time before something horrible
occurs.

Gamemaster's Characters
-----------------------

During their adventures players' characters encounter various allies,
enemies, and neutrals who serve to shape the story, establishing the
setting or helping or hindering the characters at critical moments.
Without these characters, nothing much would happen.
However, you don't have to create enough characters to ﬁll the
entire universe. Save yourself work and carefully choose which 
gamemaster's characters play the most pivotal roles in your adventure 
and design them in detail. Then select the less important characters and
determine most of their background and personality, and so on until
you come down to the nameless characters who need nothing more
than a brief mention.

### Assigning Characteristics ###

Once you've come up with the overall concept for the character,
you should decide on his game statistics. Skim through the "Character
Basics" and "Character Options" chapters for some ideas, jotting down
whatever details are important for the character's importance to the
adventure and what's needed to use him. There's no need to follow the
character creation rules exactly; instead, give each character what you
think they need to play their part in the story.

The average adult human being has 2D in all attributes. Depending on 
how much experience you want an individual to have, give the
character between 7 and 14 dice in skills. 

Children will generally have 1D in all attributes, with two or three
dice in skills, such as throwing (for tossing baseballs, footballs, food,
etc.), climb/jump, running, swim, computer interface/repair, hide, and
con. Older or gifted children may have more or a greater variety of
skills. Children will have few, if any, specializations. They often carry
a favorite toy or nothing.

Elderly adults may have fewer dice in their Agility, Mechanical, and
Strength. However, they have twice as many skill dice (between 14 and
20) to account for their greater experience.

Body Points for generic characters likewise depend on age and toughness. 
For base Body Points, use these guidelines: 5 for kids and elderly
individuals, 10 for ordinary innocent bystanders and most animals,
15 for minor villainous opponents, and 20 for major secondary and
leading gamemaster's characters. Add to these values any additional
points as you deem appropriate.

Should you prefer the Wounds system, be sure to drop one or
more levels from the bottom of the list. For example, most animals,
kids, and elderly would take one Wound level (Incapacitated) before
dying, while minor character and large animals might take two (Stun
and Incapacitated), and so on.

### Character Points and Fate Points ###

Cannon-fodder villains, such as army troops, henchmen, and merchants 
typically have no Character Points or Fate Points. Minor villains, whose
survival isn't dependent upon the adventure's plot may have one to three 
Character Points and (usually) no Fate Points.

Continuing villains, such as those who may be used for several adventures 
or who are subordinate to  the main villain, may have several Character 
Points and no more than one or two Fate Points. Major villains who might
be used over the course of a campaign and are integral to an adventure 
should have at least 11 Character Points (some characters may have
well over 50 Character Points) and many will have at least three Fate 
Points.


Starting the Adventure
----------------------

Once you've got the goal and a few obstacles, you'll need to give the
players' characters a reason to go on the adventure. Often called the
hook, here are a few examples.

* Character Goals: The group, even just one of the players' characters,
gets information that could help get them closer to a long-term goal.

* Informant: Someone lets the players' characters know about the goal
and gives them just enough information to get to the ﬁrst obstacle. The
information could be provided as a letter, a holo-vid announcement, a
classiﬁed ad, or an anonymous source.

* In Medias Res: Start the game in the middle of an explosive or
suspenseful event. Such fast starts put the players immediately on their
toes, thrusting their characters into the action before they even know
it. Once they've dealt with their immediate problem, they're thoroughly
enmeshed in the story.

* Mission Brieﬁng: The organization in which the characters are
involved calls a meeting and sets reveals the goal (though, of course,
not how to accomplish it!).


Running Adventures
------------------

You've successfully brought the players' characters into the adventure.
Now you have to keep them focused and enthralled with the plot. If you
see their eyes start to wander, or they fall into a conversation about the
last game (or worse, what they watched on television last night), you
know something's gone wrong. This section should help you maintain
an involving story and a sense of "really being there."


Setting the Scene
-----------------

Your ﬁrst job is to vividly depict the scene unfolding before the
players' characters. Where are they? Who else is there? What's happening? 
These are the questions you must answer immediately.


### Description ###

The key here is to engage the players' senses, just like a good movie, 
novel, or television show. Try to use evocative words to give the players 
a clear and vivid view of their characters' environment. The best way
to learn how to provide such lifelike descriptions is to picture the 
scene in your mind and do whatever you can to convey that same
scene to your players. You may incorporate movie or television footage 
you've taped, maps and diagrams you copied out of library books, or even 
illustrations you've drawn yourself. Sound effects CDs especially can
help you set the stage for the characters. 

Just remember that your players have ﬁve senses. Don't just rely on the 
sense of sight. Describe what your characters hear, smell, touch, and (
sometimes) taste. The following example engages several senses.

Gamemaster: *"You step out of the shuttle and onto soggy ground with a 
squish. The thick, musty smell of the swamp immediately washes over you. 
From all around you, you can hear the screeching chirps of birds and
small animals. The humidity settles against your skin like a blanket of 
moisture as you walk away from the shuttle. The gangly gray trees 
scattered in small stands reach upward into the mist, and you get the 
distinct feeling that something out there is watching you."*


### Believable Characters ###

Other than the setting, the players' characters will also encounter 
other people who live in the game world. Your job is to make sure
that these gamemaster's characters appear
real to the players. Their words and actions
must seem appropriate in the context of their
histories, personalities, and ambitions. If a
stoic military officer suddenly took off his
helmet and started joking around, the players
would probably just stare at you for a minute
as the game comes crashing to a halt.

Play each character to the best of your
ability. Make sure he does everything in his
power to achieve his goals, whether he's trying to thwart the players'
characters or earn a hefty sum of credits. This does not mean that each
gamemaster's character should act overtly. Part of his goal may be to
achieve his objective undetected, or to make it look like someone else
was responsible. Rather, the idea is that the character should use all of
his resources -- his skills, allies, ﬁnances, and so on -- to accomplish
his immediate as well as his long-term goals.


### Exciting Locales ###

Try to make each place the players' characters visit seem different
than the others. By doing this, you can make these sites engaging and
memorable for the players.


### Personal Stake ####

Every once in while you should ask to see the players' character
sheets. Look for background information and personality traits that
might lend themselves to a personal stake. If a player has written that
her character is extremely competitive, for example, you could create a
rival group that seeks to outdo the players' characters at every turn. The
players will do everything in their power to make sure their characters
succeed more often and more quickly than the newcomers.


### Giving Options ###

Don't constantly force your players to follow along the prescribed
path of the adventure. They may have devised an alternate scheme for
success not covered by the scenario, and you shouldn't penalize them
for their creativity. Instead you'll have to use your judgment to run the
remainder of the adventure.

If the players feel that they never have a choice, that you have 
predetermined what their characters will do and say -- and therefore, 
how the adventure will turn out -- they're not going to have any 
interest in playing. Part of the fun of a roleplaying game is the 
almost unlimited possible reactions to any given situation. Take
that away, and you've lost much of the reason for participating in 
this type of game.

Sometimes the characters will
have only a few choices -- or at least, a
few obvious choices -- and that's ﬁne
if it makes logical sense in the context
of the scenario and doesn't seem like
an attempt by you as the gamemaster
to dictate their characters' paths.

Reward creativity. Give the players a reason to exercise their brains.
The more freedom they believe they have, the more they'll enjoy the
adventure. When their characters make a mistake, they have no one
else to blame it on, and when their characters succeed, they feel 
a genuine sense of accomplishment.


The Subtle Art of Misdirection
------------------------------

If the players can correctly guess the conclusion of an adventure while
they're progressing through the ﬁrst encounter, the ensuing encounters
won't provide as much excitement as they should.

This is where the subtle art of misdirection comes in. The object
here is to keep the players (and their characters) guessing and revising
those guesses through the whole adventure. You can do this in small
ways: make die rolls, smile for a moment, and then don't say anything
about it; have the characters roll Perception checks, ask for their totals,
and then just continue with the encounter; ask a player for detailed
information on how her character is going to close a door ("Which
hand are you using?" "Do you have a weapon in your hand?"), but then
have the portal close uneventfully.

You also have the option of throwing in major red herrings. If a
character starts tracking the players' characters, the players will 
immediately attempt to mesh this new person's presence with the rest of the
adventure. In reality, however, he's just a common thief looking for an
easy mark, or he thinks that one of the characters looks familiar but
doesn't want to say anything until he's sure he's not mistaking that
character for someone else.


Allowing the Characters to Fail
-------------------------------

It's that chance of failure that gives excitement to a roleplaying game,
so sometimes characters need to fail. If they roll poorly, or are simply
outclassed, or most importantly, if they play poorly, their characters
will not accomplish their goal.

Yet, with each defeat, the characters (and players) should learn
something. They may learn a better way to approach a situation, or
they may stumble upon a tool or gadget that will help them in the
future. It should take perseverance and dedication, but learning from
mistakes will eventually lead to success.


Getting Feedback
----------------

Sometimes an adventure doesn't thrill the players like you expected it
to when you were ﬁrst reading or creating it. As you run a scenario, you
should pay attention to the players' reactions to the various scenes. Did
they stand up and all try to talk at once during the chase? Did they go
comatose when they reached the puzzle-solving encounter? Gauge their
reactions to your judgment calls and improvisation. The players' words
and actions can convey a great deal of information about which parts of
the adventure they enjoyed and which parts put them to sleep.
Ask the players what they did and didn't like. You could even have
them write you an anonymous note with a list of their favorite and
least favorite scenes.

Don't take any negative responses as criticism. It takes a lot of work
to plan and run a game, and you can't always please everyone no matter
what you do. Just don't forget to listen to what your players have to say.
They may want to take the game in a different direction than you do.
Compromise. Make sure you and your players have fun. If not, either
you or your players will eventually give up and ﬁnd something else to
do during those precious spare moments. View player reactions and
comments as hints for what you can do in the next adventure that will
keep them on the edge of their seats.


Rewarding the Players
---------------------

Part of the fun of roleplaying is watching characters improve and
develop. Gamemasters have plenty of options for helping that along,
though, of course, no single option should be overused or the players
will have no reason to continue adventuring.


Advantages (and Disadvantages)
------------------------------

Look through the list of Advantages for some reward ideas. Typically,
when a gamemaster allows access to an Advantage, it's a one-shot deal,
especially for particularly powerful Advantages, such as being owed a favor
by a galactic tyrant. If the characters want a more permanent access to
this kind of Advantage, they will have pay for it (in Character Points).
Gamemasters might also give free Advantages to characters -- along
with an equivalent amount of Disadvantages!


Equipment and Other Loot
------------------------

Depending on the circumstances of the present adventure and the
gamemaster's ideas for future adventures, gamemasters may allow the
players' characters to keep equipment, gear, and treasure that they ﬁnd
in abandoned temples or acquire from a villain's lair. Gamemasters
may even want to plant various items in the adventure for the players'
characters to locate, whether to fulﬁll a character's dream or help the
group in a future scenario. Should the equipment or other material
cause the players' characters to become too powerful, too quickly,
remember that things can break, become the object of desire by more
powerful personages, or get stolen.


Funds
-----

Characters might choose to sell some of their loot and put the
money into their bank account or investments. Depending on what
characters do with their money, gamemasters may allow a permanent
one-pip increase to each of their Funds attribute (because of putting
it into solid investments as determined by a business roll), or give the
characters a larger bonus to a limited number of Funds rolls (because
they kept the cash in a vault at their hideout).


Information
-----------

While not terribly tangible, information could be useful for drawing
the characters into another adventure or helping to fulﬁll a character's
goal (such as discovering details about her mysterious past).


Character and Fate Points
-------------------------

Assuming that the players have really been trying and have been
sufficiently challenged by the adventure, each character should receive
enough Character Points to improve one skill, plus a few extra for help
in overcoming a low roll at a future inconvenient time. Obviously, more
experienced characters will either have to experience more adventures,
or they'll need bigger challenges.

Here are a few guidelines for distributing Character and Fate Points
for an adventure that lasts two or more nights, several hours per night.
They are per character, not per group.

resist being told what to do. They may have Technical attribute of 0D.

are trained otherwise.

D6 Reference Sheet
==================

Generic Difﬁculties
-------------------

See Game Basics section for general task resolution information and other
modiﬁers.

* Automatic (0): Almost anyone can perform this action; there is no
need to roll. (Generally, this difficulty is not listed in a pregenerated
adventure; it is included here for reference purposes.)

* Very Easy (1-5): Nearly everyone can accomplish this task. Typically,
tasks with such a low difficulty only are rolled when they are crucial
to the scenario.

* Easy (6-10): Although characters usually have no difficulty with
this task, an untrained character may ﬁnd it challenging.
Moderate (11-15): There is a fair chance that the average character
will fail at this type of task. Tasks of this type require skill, effort, and
concentration.

* Difficult (16-20): Those with little experience in the task must
have a lot of luck to accomplish this type of action.
Very Difficult (21-25): The average character only rarely succeeds
at these kinds of task. Only the most talented regularly succeed.
Heroic (26-30), Legendary (31 or more): These kinds of tasks are
nearly impossible, though there's still a slim chance that lucky average
or highly experienced characters can accomplish them.


Generic Difﬁculty Modiﬁers
--------------------------

See Choosing Difficulties section for examples.

* Spotting a few speciﬁc details (ex. identities of individuals): 20
* Spotting a few obscure details (ex. speciﬁcs of conversation): 25
* Noticing many obscure details: 30 or more


Movement Difﬁculty Modiﬁers
---------------------------

* Rough terrain (large but negotiable obstacles, strong undercurrent, 
  climbing a rough wall, ﬂying near unyielding obstacles such as 
  pillars or trees): +10
* Very rough terrain (dense and large obstacles, stormy weather, a 
  few airborne hazards, hail): +15

  large waves, climbing a smooth surface, complete darkness): +20
* Very hazardous terrain (corridor ﬁlled with falling debris and 
  explosions, swimming or ﬂying in a hurricane): +25 or more


Combat Summary
--------------

### Determining the Difficulty ###

* Base combat difficulty = defense total
* Defense total = (passive defense value or active defense value)
  plus combat difficulty modiﬁers
* Passive defense value = 10
* Active defense value = full or partial defense value
  * Full defense value = any defense skill roll + 10
  * Partial defense value = any defense skill roll


### Determining Success ###

If the attacker's combat skill total plus any modiﬁers equals or exceeds
the target's defense roll, the attack succeeds and may do damage.


### Determining Damage ###

* Damage total
  * For attacks that do damage not modiﬁed by strength: damage
    total = roll of weapon damage die code plus damage modiﬁers
For attacks that do damage modiﬁed by strength: damage total
= roll of weapon damage die code plus character's Strength Damage
die code plus damage modiﬁers
Damage resistance total
Body Points: roll of Armor die code plus defense modiﬁers
Wounds: roll of Strength plus Armor die code plus defense
modiﬁers
If the damage total is greater than the damage resistance total,
the target was injured. If the damage total is less than or equal to the
damage resistance total, the target was not injured.
If the target was injured, subtract the damage resistance total from
the damage total. Then either subtract this from the target's current Body
Total or compare the value on the "Wound Level" chart.


### Common Combat Difﬁculty Modiﬁers ###

*Cover Situation: Modiﬁer*

* Light smoke/fog: +1D (+3)
* Thick smoke/fog: +2D (+6)
* Very thick smoke/fog: +4D (+12)
* Poor light, twilight: +1D (+3)
* Moonlit night: +2D (+6)
* Complete darkness: +4D (+12)
* Object hides 25% of target: +1D (+3)
* Object hides 50% of target: +2D (+6)
* Object hides 75% of target: +4D (+12)
* Object hides 100% of target: If cover offers protection, the 
  attacker cannot hit the target directly, but damage done to the 
  cover might exceed the Armor Value it provides, and, indirectly, 
  damage the target. Most of the time, the attacker must eliminate
  the cover before having a chance to hit the target.


*Range: Distance to Target: Modiﬁer*

* Point Blank: 0-3 meters: -5
* Short: 3 meters to ﬁrst value in the weapon's range listing: 0
* Medium: First to second value in the weapon's range listing: +5
* Long: Second to third value in the weapon's range listing: +10


Weapon is difficult to use (character unfamiliar with technology,
object is hard to throw or grasp, melee or thrown weapon is more than
60 centimeters long, etc.): +5 or more to the combat difficulty. The 
gamemaster may decide that such factors as experience, strength, and 
features of the weapon (such as a well-balanced sword) lower this 
modiﬁer.

Strength Damage
---------------

To ﬁgure the Strength Damage die code, drop the pips from the
character's Strength or lift die code (but include any Disadvantages or
Special Abilities), divide the number by 2, and round up.


Wound Levels
------------

See Damage sectuib for additional information and modiﬁers.

Wounds = Damage Total ≥ Resistance Total By


*Effect: Wounds: Body Points Left*

* Stunned: 1 to 3: 80% - 60%
* Wounded: 4 to 8: 59% - 40%
* Severely Wounded: 4 to 8 (see note): 39% - 20%
* Incapacitated: 9 to 12: 19% - 10%
* Mortally Wounded: 13 to 15: 1% - 9%
* Dead: 16 or more: 0


Note: Penalties imposed by each level are not cumulative and they are
not included when determining the resistance total or damage done by 
nonstrength-based weapons. Any additional damage less than the 
character's dcurrent level moves the character up by one level.

A character moves to the Severely Wounded level if the difference is
between 4 and 8 and she already has the Wounded level.
†Note: This is an optional chart for use with Body Points. The "Body
Points Left" column is based on the character's maximum Body Points.
Round so no overlap exists between levels. Penalties imposed by each 
level are not cumulative; do not include them when determining the stun 
or damage resistance total or any total not involving a skill or 
attribute.

Stunned: Either receives -1D for all remaining actions this round
and next round or may only defend or retreat in the next round.

Wounded: -1D to all actions until healed.

Severely Wounded: -2D on all actions until healed.

Incapacitated: As a free action before losing consciousness, he may
try to stay up with a Moderate (15) stamina roll. If the character 
succeeds, he may continue to act, but all actions have a -3D penalty. 
If he fails, he is knocked out for 10D minutes.

Mortally Wounded: Knocked unconscious with no chance to keep
up. Roll the character's Strength each round, the character ﬁnally dying
if the roll is less than the number of minutes he's been at this level.

Dead: The character is toast.


Abbreviated Healing Chart
-------------------------

See Damage sectuib for additional information and modiﬁers.

*Medicine Total: Body Points Recovered: Current Wound Level*

* 1 to 5: 2: None    
* 6 to 10: 1D: Stunned, Unconscious    
* 11 to 15: 2D: Wounded, Severely Wounded    
* 16 to 20: 3D: Incapacitated    
* 21 to 25: 4D: Mortally Wounded    
* 26 to 30: 5D: Dead    


Die Code Simpliﬁcation
======================

As characters progress, often the number of dice players have to
roll and add becomes daunting. With this in mind, this chart provides
two ways of reducing the amount of dice needed.

The fast way is to roll ﬁve dice, including the Wild Die, add the results,
and then add the die code's pips and a bonus number. To determine
the bonus number, ﬁnd the die code (ignoring the pips) of the original
attribute, skill, weapon, or other value in the "Die Code" column. Then
read across to the "5D" column to get the bonus number.

Example: *A character has a Natural Ranged Weapon that does
30D of damage. Instead of rolling 30 dice, the player rolls ﬁve and
adds 88 to the total on the dice.*

The faster way is to roll only the Wild Die, adding to its result the
corresponding bonus listed in the "Wild Die" column of the chart.

Example: *A character has a skill with a value of 10D. The gamemaster 
rolls the Wild Die and adds 32 to the result.*

When using only the Wild Die, a Critical Failure only indicates
a complication or funny thing happening; it does not affect the total
rolled.

Because Character Points function similar to a Wild Die, roll
any dice gained from Character Point expenditure separately. When
using Fate Points on a roll, double the original die code and use that
to determine the bonus number.

For bonus numbers beyond the 50D level for the "5D" column,
subtract 5 from the die code and multiply the number by 3.5. Round
up.

To get bonus numbers beyond the 50D level for the "Wild Die"
column, subtract 1 from the die code and multiply the number by
3.5. Round up.
