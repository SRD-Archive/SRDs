Expanding and
Restricting the Aspects
Introduction

This chapter takes a closer look at most of the spell creation
aspects, clarifying fuzzy points or expanding on options.

Area Effect

The “one alternate shape” modifier allows the magic user
to include two possible shapes during the during the design
of the spell. At casting, the spell user decides which shape is
more appropriate. “Several alternate shapes” is a more general
version of the “one alternate shape” modifier.
The targeting bonus for three-dimensional shapes can only
be used against the primary target of the spell.

Area Effect: Continuous Effect
Some spell effects are so small that reducing their values
by 1 as the spell radiates from the center would render
them useless. In these cases, the effect retains its total value
throughout the targeted region at no additional cost.
But what happens when a caster wants a larger value to
be continuous over an area? This technically falls under the
domain of the multiple targets aspect. Gamemasters may
choose to allow mages to use area effect; however, the total
value of the aspect is multiplied by 5 and the caster does not
get the targeting bonus for three-dimensional shapes.

Area Effect: Divination
Altough a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing,
divination spells can get rather costly for the seemingly little
that they do. To this end, divination spells have their own
cost for the area effect aspect: Look up the radius of the
area of effect as a measure on the “Spell Measures” chart;
double its corresponding value to get the value of the area
of effect: divination circle aspect. Triple the “Spell Measures”
value for three-dimensional areas. A divination circle with
a one-meter radius costs one, while a divination sphere of
the same size is two.
Example: A spell that searches a 10-kilometer-wide area at
ground level has an area of effect: divination circle value of 40,
while a 10-kilometer divination sphere has a value of 60.
A caster can use the divination area of effect to search
for multiple targets with no additional difficulty. However,
the caster does not receive the area of effect bonus to target
the spell.
To find something that the caster can’t see, add the variable movement: bending aspect to the spell. When added to

divination spells, it does not increase the difficulty of locating
the target.
Note that divination spells with a range and no area of effect
provide information about the first thing that it encounters
that meets the criteria of the spell. The caster can only look in
one direction per casting of the spell, regardless of the spell’s
duration, unless she includes the change target aspect.

Area Effect: Odd Shapes
A sphere might not always be the best shape for a spell’s
effect. The measurements for each of the following shapes
is roughly equivalent to a circle or sphere with a one-meter
radius. The formula for determing a two-dimensional shape’s
area or a three-dimensional shape’s volume is included, for
those designers who want a more precise conversion from
the default shape.

Default Shapes
Circle: +1 per half-meter radius. (Area equals radius
squared times pi.)
Sphere: +5 per meter radius, with a +1 bonus to hit the
initial target. (Volume equals radius cubed times pi times 4
divided by 3.)

Odd Shapes
Wall: +1 for the first meter of length and width and +1 per
each additional two meters (total) of length and/or width.
Example: A wall two meters tall and two meters wide (about
the size of a standard set of double doors) has a value of +2,
while a shield one meter wide and one meter tall has a cost
of +1. A wall can be any length or height, but it is considered
a two-dimensional shape and thus always only a few centimeters thick. (Area equals length times width.)
Blast: +1 for the first meter of length and final width and
+1 per each additional two meters (total) of length and/or
width. A blast is one meter wide at its base, a few centimeters
thick, and extends out from the caster. It catches everyone in
its path, even those behind the first target. It is considered a
two-dimensional shape. Example: A blast three meters long
with a terminating width of one meter costs +2, as does a
cone that’s one meter long and three meters at its end. (Area
equals 1 plus the ending width, with the result multiplied
by half of the length.)
Hemisphere: +5 per meter radius, with a +1 bonus to hit
the central target. This is a three-dimensional shape. (Volume
equals 2 times pi times radius cubed divided by 3.)

Cone: +5 for a basic cone two meters long and a base with
a one-meter radius and +1 for each additional half meter of
length or meter of base radius. A cone is no more than a
few centimeters wide at its tip, and it extends out from the
caster. This is a three-dimensional shape. Example: A cone
that’s three meters long with a base two meters wide (radius
of one meter) has a cost of +7. (Volume equals pi times height
times the radius of the base squared divided by 3.)
Cuboid: This is a three-dimensional shape. (Volume equals
length times width times height.)
Cylinder: This is a three-dimensional shape. (Volume
equals radius of an end squared times length times pi.)
Pyramid: When used a projection, the pyramid is no more
than few centimeters wide at its tip, and it extends out from
the caster. This is a three-dimensional shape. (Volume equals
width of base times length of base times height.)

Your Own Expansions and
Restrictions
This section expounds on many aspects of the
spell design system, but it doesn’t cover everything.
Gamemasters should add their own restrictions and
usage notes to fit their concept of magic and its place
in their worlds.
(((sidebar)))

Casting Time

A spell that takes five seconds or longer to cast will go off
at the beginning of the round after the end of the casting
time.
Usually, a character may not cast two spells at the same
time — especially if either one has a concentration aspect.
But, hey, there just might be some brilliant wizard who should
have no problem with multi-tasking. Not only should this
sort of wizard have his mental attributes at 4D or higher
(modified or unmodified), he should also get a multi-action
modifier to his skill rolls when casting the spells.
Similarly, gamemasters may decide that magic users setting
off spells that take a round or longer to cast may not perform
any other actions unless the spells include no gestures, incantations, or community, nor take any concentration.
For spells with casting times of 3.5 seconds or less, the
gamemaster should allow other actions to be performed in the
same round. The maximum number, though, depends on how
long the gamemster feels the other desired actions take.
See the sidebar for guidelines on discharging spells with
casting times of less than one round (five seconds).

(((sidebar)))
How Many Spells Can I Cast in a
Round?
Gamemasters who want to impose some control on
how many tasks their characters can perform in a single

five-second round should limit the number of actions to
five. (Of course, gamemasters may wish to adjust this
limit for super-speedy or super-slow characters.)
As spells have casting times associated with them,
it’s easy to see that your character can only cram so
many castings into a single round. You can use the
following formula or reference the chart to figure out
just what you magic user can do.
Remember that the multi-action modifier affects
every action that the character takes in a single round.
If the character is casting spells and doing other actions,
figure the penalty for each separately and add 1 to the
total penalty.
Example: Harold the Magic Student decides to cast
two one-second spells and get out components for a
longer spell, which he intends to cast next round. Casting two one-second spells has a penalty of -1D, while, if
he were to only retrieve the components, there would
be no penalty. Therefore, Harold has a total multi-action
penalty for this round of -2D (1D for the spells + 0 for
the components + 1).
Duration is not figured in when deciding how many
spells may be cast each round.
See the specific rules for multi-actions in each rulebook for more details on multi-action penalties.

Long Casting Times
Spells that can be charged and have long casting times
can be unbalancing to games if the gamemaster forgets that
these are prime times to make the character’s life miserable.
Remember that, should the spell be interrupted, the magic
user has to start over. Worse, any components that are
destroyed either by the end of the casting time or the end
of the duration are destroyed if anything goes wrong with
finishing the spell.

Change Target

In a single round, a character can make a maximum of
five change targets plus one change target for each additional action she receives because of a Special Ability, piece
of equipment, or other similarly benefitting circumstance.
Gamemasters should reduce the maximum accordingly based
on other actions the character performs in the round.

Charges: Basic & Improved

The duration of a charged spell doesn’t start until the
spell goes off. Likewise, when setting off a charge, do not
consider the casting time; it was taken care when the spell
was charged.
A charged spell does not necessarily need to also include
the focus aspect. However, if the charge releases a spell with
a long duration, it’s wise to include the focus aspect if you
think that the target of the spell’s effect might move.
According to the magic system presented in the rulebook,
it’s rather easy to add charges to any spell. To keep charged
spells from getting out of hand, include these caveats with
basic charges and wards:
u maximum of five charges
u released at a rate of one per round
u wear off after 24 hours
For improved charges and wards, the difficulty equals 5
times the number of charges that the character wishes to
include. (Wards still equal 10% more.) Though they’re more
difficult to cast, improved charges don’t wear off. They may
be used as often as desired per round, as long as the number
of uses doesn’t exceed the number of charges the spell has.
Thus, a spell with three charges may be used once in each of
three rounds, three times in one round, or some combination. Using multiple charges in a single round is considered
a multi-action.
No target (person or thing that is charged) may be imbued
with more than one set of charges of a single spell (though
they might hold charges of different spells). This holds for
both basic and improved charges.
Charges, whether basic or improved, require a conscious
effort (and thus an action) to go off, even if they don’t require
any kind of roll. Wards trigger themselves, so they don’t take
up a character’s action.
Generally, charged items are within a meter of the caster
or the target of the charged spell’s effect is within one meter
of where the charge goes off. If this is not the case, the spell
designer should include two ranges and two speeds — one
to indicate the distance between the caster and the charge,
and one to express the distance between the charged spell’s
effect and the target.
The user of a charged doesn’t need to worry about these
aspects of the spell, because the caster took care of them in
the initial performance of the spell: casting time, community,
concentration, components, feedback, gestures, incantations,
and other conditions requiring the caster to do something.
The charge user, however, is bound by other aspects of the

spell (including anything that require the releaser to do
soemthing), as well as the spell’s targeting or use skill.

Wards
Failing a ward’s circumvention roll triggers the spell. Additionally, if the spell requires a key word or phrase to set it
off, it becomes a ward rather charge. Required targeting rolls
(such as attack rolls) do not count as a specific skill required
to circumvent the ward, even if a successful targeting roll is
what triggers the ward.
If the ward is circumvented, it does not go off and the
charge does not dissipate (unless it’s a basic charge that’s
come to the end of its 24 hours of existence).
Realize that a spell with one warded charge affects the
first person who fails the circumvention roll. After that, the
spell disappears. To have charged spells prey upon more than
innocent victim, either include multiple charges, multiple
targets, or the area effect aspect.

Charges, Memorizing Spells, and
Scribing Spells
Gamemasters can use charges to simulate memorized
spells or spells that go off when anyone reads them off a
scroll or out of a book.
To memorize a spell, the magic user decides how many times
she wants to have the spell handy, multiplies this number
by 2.5, rounds up the value, and adds it to the difficulty of
the spell in question.
Example: Harold the Magic Student decides to memorize
mystic bolt three times. The modifier to memorize the spell
is +8 (3 times 2.5, rounded up). The final difficulty of casting
three memorized charges of mystic bolt is 18.
The magic user may only memorize spells for herself; she
may not put these kinds of charges on someone else unless
she first creates a new spell.
The D6 Fantasy Rulebook offers a detailed method for
designing scrivened spells (see the sidebar on page 99). This
simpler version doesn’t require any preparation or special
components, it can be used by the person who sets down
the spell, and it lasts indefinitely:
The scribe decides on the number of times the spell can be
read before the “magic runs out of it,” multiplies this number
by 3, and adds that to the difficulty of casting the spell. The
spell will then be released each time that anyone with the
appropriate skill reads the spell.

Community

A simple action almost never has a difficulty, even if the
“Number of Helpers” chart indicates a modifier. Of course, the
gamemaster has the final say on what constitutes a “simple”
action, and may even decide that a simple action done repetively can become tedious, which leads to the possiblility of
error. In these cases, a difficulty of 5 plus the community’s
diffictuly modifier is appropriate.

A number of helpers performing different actions with the
same difficulty level should be counted as a single group for
purposes of determining the community modifier.

difficulty, etc.), any components that are designated to be
destroyed either by the end of the casting time or the end
of the duration are reduced to useless material.

Helpers’ Magical Ability

Substituting Components

The level of the helpers’ magical ability can also affect the
community modifier. Helpers should be grouped based on
how many dice they have in their Magic attribute. Those with
none have no effect on the community modifier. Those with
add 1 to the community modifier per full die in the average
Magic attribute value of the group (round up). Thus, if three
of the group of five senior apprentices has 1D+1 in the Magic
attribute and two have 2D, the group average is 2D and they
give a bonus of 2 to the community modifier.

Sometimes, characters might not be able to find what they
need to cast a particular spell. Or they might buy components
from a cut-rate alchemist who mixes in cheaper ingredients
instead of using pure stuff. Usually, she adds coal dust to
dark-colored ones, lime or chalk to light-colored ingredients,
and chips of appropriately colored glass to crystal or gem
shards.
Though it makes the spell less expensive to cast, using
cheaper ingredients with an existing formula when the
caster is not attempting to make a new spell does not modify
the difficulty to cast the spell. However, there are negative
consequences to using substitutes: For the spell to go off correctly, the skill total needs to beat the difficulty by 2 for every
subpar ingredient the character uses. Otherwise, “something
bad happes” — and the less the skill total beats the difficulty
by, the worse that “something” should be.
Thus, a spell with one low-quality component would have
problems if the skill total equaled or beat the difficulty by up
to two points; two low-quality ingredients would lower the
spell’s effectiveness with zero to four points, and so on.
Page 106 of the D6 Bloodshadows worldbook offers another
method for determing the effect of low-quality ingredients
on potion potency.

Components

Through the use of the components modifier, a clever
character can greatly reduce the difficulty of a spell. However, there are a few things to keep in mind before adding
components to a spell or using one that has them.
The character must have the components on her person. The more variety of components used in her repetoire
of spells, the bigger her pack. Gamemasters looking to keep
characters in check can require them to keep track of their
component usage. They may also require periodic stamina
rolls for the character, to simulate the effort needed to tote
around a full laboratory.
Unless otherwise specified in the spell, assume that the
caster needs a fistful of the component for the spell to
work.
The character must be in full possession of the
components. The component can in no way have power
over her. So, if a spell required a “prison door” to cast, and
the mage was locked behind such a door, she couldn’t use
it for her spell. She doesn’t have the door in her possession
and it has some “power” over her (in this case, it’s restricting her location). Now, if she were to take the door off its
hinges, then it would be useful for the spell. For players
who get out of control with components, the gamemaster
can put further restrictions on the components (especially
ones that are destroyed), requiring that they be in the magic
user’s possession for a minimum period of time or that the
caster needs to do something special to make them “spell
components.”
The character must have at least one free manipulating limb (a hand in a human) in order to use a component.
It takes at least one action to get the components
out or prepare them for casting the spell, even if this
action doesn’t require a roll. Mages better learn to be sneaky
about getting things out in battle!

Destroyed Components and Failed
Spells
If for any reason (for example, the spell was interrupted
during the casting time; the mage failed to meet the spell’s

Cost of Components
The cost of components depends on the quality required
by the spell and is determined by the gamemaster and the
dictates of the setting. Gamemasters can get some pricing
ideas from the “Equipment” chapters of the rulebooks.

Concentration

If the spell includes the concentration aspect, the caster
may perform no other actions outside of those necessary
for casting the spell.
The concentration difficulty assumes a quiet room and no
distrations. Spell designer should not include the distraction
modifiers when creating the spell. Gamemasters, however,
should use the distration modifiers liberally. The distraction
modifier is added to the diffiuclty when the player makes her
character’s concentration roll.

Scribing a Spell

Once a magic user designs a spell, he doesn’t automatically
remember it forever. The process of creating a spell is simply
too complex. To forego having to redesign spells each time,
wizards write down their spells on scrolls or in books. This
adds an extra 10% (round up) to the design time, but the mage
will never have to repeat the design time for that spell and he
can share it with others. However, he will need to reference
the book or scroll when he wants to cast that spell.

Failing a Required Skill Roll
Some spells include aspects, such as incantations
and gestures, that require additional skill rolls. Mages
should be confident that they can succeed at these rolls
before casting the spell. The result of a failure at one
or more of these rolls is up to the gamemaster. Some
options include:
• The spell doesn’t go off. This is suitable for severe
failures or multiple minimal faillures.
• The spell goes off, but there’s something wonky
about it. This option is good for a minimal failure, or
a minimal success with a Critical Failure.
• The spell goes off, but there’s something definitely
wrong with it — it might have the opposite effect or
it might cause some kind of permanent and negative
alteration to the caster. This is best reserved for a severe
failure with a Critical Failure.
(((sidebar)))

Countenance

In fantastical settings, gamemasters may expand the
appearance changes to include unreal effects, including glowing eyes, a visible aura, flaming nostrils, hair that stands on
end, and so on.
The countenance alteration can appear on either the caster
of the spell or the user of the spell’s effect. It can never be
applied to a target who cannot control the effect (such as
someone receiving a curse or damage).

Duration

A spell’s duration determines how long the rite’s effect
hangs around. Sometimes, though, it’s tough to determine
how long that duration should be.

Damage-Dealing Spells
The minimum duration for a damage-dealing spell is one
second. Some spell designers add longer durations for more

Memorizing a Spell

To memorize a spell, the caster must have the arcane lore
specialization of scholar. The difficulty to memorize the spell
equals the spell’s difficulty. The number of continuous rounds
it takes to memorize the spell equals the spell’s difficulty
divided by 5 (round up). During these rounds, the magic
user must devote her complete concentration to fixing the
spell in her mind.
While it is more convenient to memorize a scribed spell,
a caster may memorize one that she has recently designed.
Memorizing is not the same as charging a spell. The caster
still needs to go through the casting requirements. However,
the caster no longer needs carrying the book or scroll that
the spell is on.

flashy effects or to get the difficulty to meet a minimum
number.
Damage-dealing spells applied to a target for more than
one round harm the target once per round until the duration runs out.

Divination Spells
The divination skill lets you uncover the deepest mysteries
of the universe. Great; how long does that take? If divination reveals information, how does the duration affect what
information is gleaned? How do you know if your divination
spell is the right length?
In many spells, the required duration will be fairly obvious. For example, a magic mirror spell that lets you see other
people in real time will require a duration of however long
you want to spy on them. If it has a duration of a minute,
then you’ve got 60 seconds to peek on them.
But other effects are harder to learn. If I cast my sense murderer spell, how long does it have to be to have an effect?
In general, a duration of 0 (one second) is only useful for
the briefest of divinations — the kind of insight that can
be answered in yes/no terms. Thus if you had a sense danger
cantrip with a duration of one second, it would pretty much
only be able to say if there was or was not danger (as defined
and detectible by the spell) within range. Absolutely no additional information would be revealed (such as location), so
a sense keys cantrip with this duration would only be able to
inform you that, yes, it did indeed sense your keys. On the
other hand, sometimes that’s all you need ...
For durations of longer than a second but less than a round,
brief but vague insights are possible. Thus if your find keys
cantrip has a duration of 2.5 seconds, a successful casting
might reveal “Over there” or “Right there” (or “Beats me!” if the
item is out of range or the effect failed). In general, anything
that could be considered a free action (see p. XX of the D6
Adventure Rulebook) may be revealed with this duration. In
other words, not much. You’ll probably need to cast find keys
multiple times to track them down. The information learned
is generally expressed in real time; you can squeeze an extra
syllable or so more into 3.5 seconds than you can in 2.5.
A duration of one round is the minimum for any “real”
information. Simplistically, information is revealed at a rate
of about one word per second, or at least as much time as
it would take the gamemaster to tell about it (whichever is
greater). The word rate assumes words of a syllable or two, so
longer words take more time and leave less room for details.
If that find keys cantrip had a duration of a round, then it
might reveal “under books by the door” or “in yesterday’s
jean’s pocket.”
Durations of longer than a round start providing more
details, as appropriate. A sense life spell with a duration of
two rounds might reveal “four life forms within range — two
to left and two to right,” while an alternate version of the
spell with a duration of a minute might say, “There are four
life forms within range. Two are to your left; one of those is
two meters away and the other is 2.5 meters. The one further
away has a larger mass than the closer one. To your right ...”

(Of course, the latter would also require a higher effect to
generate that additional information ... but at least it would
have enough time to convey it.)
For more arcane divinations, a good rule of thumb is that
the spell needs to be as long as it would take to read text
of the requested detail. Thus an arcane lore spell that offers
information about an unidentified magic object could give
a lot more information in a day-long duration than an hour.
Remember that divinations are, in their own way, cosmic
equivalents of more mundane search and investigation methods. Although they eliminate the need to actually have tomes
of information, the mind can still only absorb and process
information so fast.
The need for speed in divination durations is one of the
reason so many of that school’s spells use allegory, symbolism, and vague imagery; it’s much faster to convey “bloody
dagger in a dusty jeweled crib” than it is to say “the youngest
son of the king, having long been denied access to true power,
desires revenge, and plans on assassinating his father and
two eldest siblings ...”

Conditional Spells
Occasionally, a wicked wizard will want to whip out a spell
that lasts until a particular condition is met. For these spells,
the mage decides upon a time frame (in seconds) in which
the condition is most likely to happen. He looks the measure
on the “Spell Measures” chart and finds the corresponding
value. To this number, he adds 1. This is the duration’s value
for a conditional spell. Be sure to note the condition in the
description, and be as specific as possible.
A spell with a conditional duration lasts until the condition is met, even if that means the spell extends beyond
the normal measure for the duration value. Because of this,
gamemasters should scrutinize the duration value carefully,
asking themselves how likely — truly — is the condition to
occur within the specified time frame. For example, a spell
that “lasts until the next full moon” has a more easily determined duration than one that “lasts until this eight-year-old
child marries and has a child of her own.” Chances are that
the first will have a duration of a month, while the second
should be more on the order of 12 to 20 years (depending
the culture and the child’s potential prospects).
Conditional spells automatically disappear if the target of
the spell dies or is completely destroyed.

Feedback

If a spell provides a benefit to the target, the caster may
opt to have the target experience the spell’s feedback. This
little “bonus” may have some supplicants giving further
consideration to asking for help from magic users!

Focused

The focused aspect allows a spell’s effect to stick with a target
no matter where he goes — even out of the spell’s range. This
important aspect is one that new mages often forget.

Spell designers do not need to include the focused aspect
on unmoving targets (such as a building or a sleeping person), unless they have reason to believe that the target will
be moved before the duration ends.
(((sidebar)))

Focused vs. Charges
An item charged with a spell does not necessarily also
need the focused aspect. With charges, the wizard completes the spell, but the effect isn’t used immediately.
Instead, it’s stored in the wizard’s mind or an object,
to be released at a later time. With focused, the caster
releases the spell at the end of casting time, the effect
is used immediately, and it stays on the designated
target until the duration ends.
(((sidebar)))

Gesture

The biggest thing to remember with gestures is that the spell
won’t work if the character cannot perform the gesture.
Rather than being an automatic botch, gamemasters may
reduce the effectiveness of a spell if the character is unable
to perform it accurately.
Physical contact with a target is a common simple gesture
(with a value of -1). Even if a close combat roll is required to
target the spell, physical contact is no more than a simple
gesture.
Though a range may be listed as “touch,” specifying touch
as a gesture is often not included if the target is unmoving
(inanimate, asleep, etc.).

Incantation

Incantations generally use artist to represent designing a
lengthy or complex incation. Nonetheless, languages, reading/
writing, scholar, and persuasion would all work equally well.
As with gestures, failing to say the right words in the right
order doesn’t necessarily mean the spell fails — it does mean
that the spell does not work as expected.
The “complete sentence” level of incantations should contain more than “a few words,” which is its own level. Thus, “I
go,” while a complete sentence, only provides a -1 modifier,
because it’s only a few words long.

Range

Unless specified otherwise in the spell, the range of the
spell bends with the curvature of the earth.
Regardless of the range of the spell, the caster must be
able to somehow perceive the target.

... And Speed
Range indicates the maximum distance from the spell to
the target; speed determines how long it takes for the effect
to reach the target.
The easiest way to figure out the value for this spell is to
have it reach its destination “instantaneously.” The cost for
this equals the value of the range.

With ranges of more than five meters, including a slower
speed in the spell is virtually useless. Sure, the spell designer
could do it, but the magic user shouldn’t expect to hit a specific
target. Slow-speed spells are only good for targeting areas.
When the range is five meters or less, having a slower
speed can be a benefit to the spell difficulty, but it does
increase the combat difficulty. The hard but “accurate” way
of deciding on the difficulty is described in the rulebooks.
The easy way is to simply subtract the speed value from the
range value; use this number as the combat modifier when
targeting the spell.

Unreal Effect

The lowest disbelief difficulty is 3 (not zero).
Gamemasters may choose to use difficulty levels instead of
a static number. Targets who roll anywhere in the difficulty
level range of values realize that the spell is an illusion. See
the accompanying sidebar for the change.
Unreal effect cannot be used to disguise the true nature
of an effect. This aspect is only for inclusion in spells whose
effects disappear if disbelieved.

Variable Effect

Casters need not include this aspect for many movement,
distance, and weight effects as long as the spell is intended
for measures up to — but not greater than — the given
amount. For example, a spell that specifies it can move 150
kilograms may actually move any amount up to and including 150 kilograms. The spell has no influence whatsoever on
items weighing more than that amount.
If mage wants the spell to be sometimes useful on targets
that are greater than the listed amount, he needs to include
the variable effect aspect in the spell.
For effects that deal with die codes, skills, attributes,
Advantages, Disadvantages, Special Abilities, and the like, a
caster who wants the ability to change the effect must always
include the variable effect aspect.

Variable Movement

Realize that variable movement does not allow the spell
user to affect more than one target (unless multiple target or
change target are included). Nonetheless, wizards sometimes
include this aspect so that they can have a little “fun” with
their prey before the final attack.

Why would anyone ever use movement of effect instead
of focus? For the most part, no one would. However, say
a caster wanted to create a flight spell that did not rely on
the Flight Special Ability. (Say, he wanted to fly faster than
the limitations imposed by the Special Ability) In that case,
there’s nothing to focus. The effect would be the desired
amount of weight to be moved, and the range would be the
maximum distance that the effect can be moved. Then, the
caster would tack on the variable movement: movement of
effect aspect. This way, he could use whatever movement he
wanted, instead of being limited by the Special Ability.
When a spell with movement of effect travels out of the
spell’s range, the effect does not disapear. As with focus, the
effect lasts until the duration ends.
Movement of effect is in meters per second (not meters
per round).

Other Alterants

By default, a spell creates the simplest effect. If the spell
difficulty seems too low for the outcome explained in the
description, the other alterants aspect should be used to
reflect an increased complexity in the effect — the caster has
added fancy touches to her work.

Other Conditions

Targeting or usage rolls required by a spell are not considered “other conditions,” unless the difficulty of the spell is
high and the gamemaster is feeling generous.
Here are a few specific applications of the other conditions aspect.

Knowledge of the Target
How well the caster of the spell must know the target
falls under the domain of the other conditions aspect. Use
the accompanying chart to decide the relationship required.
Anything less than a sporadic relationship of a few years has
no affect on the spell’s difficulty.

old friends)

Sporadic influence (on-and-off relationships)

Target Type
The type of targets the spell can effect can be limited. The
exact category must be specified in the spell’s description. For
example, if spell can be used only on a single specific target,
that target must be mentioned in detail, such as “the caster’s
ring” or “the caster’s sister’s cat.” Use the accompanying
table to get an idea of the value of this version of the other
conditions aspect. Gamemasters may adjust the value up or
down depending on how likely the spell caster is to come
across the particular type of target.
If the spell also requires a component related to the target, this version of the other conditions aspect may not be
included. Additionally, do not include this aspect if the range
of the spell is “self” or “touch.”

Adding Aspects after the
Design

Certain situations may help a magic user cast a spell after
its design. Spell designers may not include any of the modifiers discussed in this section in the initial spell design. The
spell’s difficulty may not be reduced below 10 by any of these
additional modifiers. Casting spells with these modifiers
included post-facto does not add to the design time.

Components
A component’s importance to the mage can affect the
ease of casting a spell. Generally, the importance modifier
relates only to items that are destroyed in casting, but the
gamemaster may allow it for certain items the mage regularly
uses, such a favorite staff or ring. Use the accompanying
chart to decide how the mage feels about the items or locations he’s using. Gamemasters should be careful in applying
this modifier, because it’s quite difficult for someone to feel
strongly about everything he has. Players should be ready
to explain why their characters attach more than a low value
to any item used.

Community
Gamemasters may allow magic users to call upon the aid
of others to help them with particularly difficult spells.
To determine how effective a community is with a preexisting spell, figure the community modifier for the group
the mage intends to use. Subtract the new community modifier from the one required by the spell (if any). Divide this
number by 2 and round up. Subtract this number from the
spell’s difficulty.
Gamemasters may optionally allow the willingness of helpers to affect any spell with community that a wizard casts.
This factor may not be included in the spell design; it is tacked
on when the spell is performed. Use the accompanying chart
to determine the helpers’ loyalty; subtract this number from
the spell difficulty.

Keeping Magic Users in
Check
The Magic system presented in the rulebooks allows a
great deal of freedom for its users, relying on gamemasters
to impose limits appropriate to their worlds. This chapter
can help gamemasters decide what sort of limits most appeal
to them and are most suitable for their ideas of how magic
works. Naturally, the suggestions herein do not comprise an
exhaustive list; gamemasters and players will certainly be
inspired to modify what’s here or design their own.
Players may find this section helpful when designing their
characters, as many of these options are suitable for use as
Achilles’ Heel or Advantage Flaw Disadvantages.
• Impose the backlash option: Whenever the magic user
fails a spell by several points or more, he becomes dizzy from
a misuse of mystical energy, and he loses his next turn.
Some variations on the backlash option:
The wizard cannot perform spells for a number of minutes
equal to the difference between the low skill roll and the spell’s
difficulty. (Double this value for a Critical Failure.)
The wizard adds a modifier to the difficulty of performing
the next spell equal to the the difference between the low skill
roll and the spell’s difficulty (double for a Critical Failure).
• Require the design time: The design time can be used
for the first time that a magic user creates and casts a spell,
after which point, the wizard knows the spell and doesn’t
have to go through that again. Or, the design time can be
required every time; because spells are so intricate, they’re
forgotten after each use and need to be relearned.
One result of the design time is that it can take years to
learn spells with high difficulties, effectively keeping those
rites out of most campaigns. It tends to encourage designers
to put in negative spell aspects — these lower difficulties,
but they also make it more obvious that there’s a spell in use
and potentially easier to interrupt.
The rulebooks specify ways of rushing the design time
and the effect of doing so on the spell’s casting. A mage can
also take longer, just like with most other ordinary skills:
For each doubling of the time necessary, the mage adds +1D
to her skill roll when casting the spell, up to a maximum
bonus of +3D.
Under the default design time system, a spell designed
by one wizard cannot be used by another wizard, unless the
first charged the spell into an object or written document.
However, a character can reduce the amount of design time
by half when remaking a spell she previously created or when
working from another wizard’s notes.
(((sidebar)))

Compressing Design Time
Gamemasters who wish to use the design time
system but are daunted by the long time necessary
for high-difficulty spells can use one of these variants.
(Minimum design time remains the same.)
Look up the difficulty of the spell as a “measure” on
the “Spell Measusures” chart. The corresponding value
is the number of hours needed to design the spell.
Subtract from the difficulty the number in front
of the “D” for the designing wizard’s skill required by
the spell. Look up this number as a value and read the
corresponding measure (in seconds). (This method
shortens the time, but not by much, and rewards those
with high Magic skills.)
Subtract from the difficulty 2 times the number in
front of the “D” for the designing wizard’s skill required
by the spell. Use this result to determine the design
time. This option greatly reduces design times for highly
skilled characters.
Create an alternate design time chart. For example:
If the difficulty of the spell is less than 10, the design
time equals the difficulty in seconds.
If the difficulty of the spell is 10 to 20, the design
time equals the difficulty in minutes.
If the difficulty of the spell is 21 to 30, the design
time equals the difficulty in hours.
If the difficulty is greater than 30, the design time
equals the difficulty in days.
(((end sidebar)))
• Restrict wizards to casting spells from their personal documents: Magic users may only cast spells that they
have in their personal tomes or libraries. Gamemasters may
decide that as a free feature of design time, wizards automatically transcribe spells onto scrolls or tomes and include them
in their library for future use. Likewise, mages may stumble
across written spells that they may rely on.
In any case, all magic users must cast spells from documents. This requirement in no way reduces the difficulty of
casting the spell.
• Restrict the spells wizards may cast: Gamemasters
may decide that there are certain spells or types of spells
that no one in their worlds could ever possess. Many of these
should be specified at the outset of the campaign, but gamemasters reserve the right to have new spells that character
decide to create automatically fail because they violate some

heretofore unknown aspect of the setting’s nebulous “laws
of magic.”
• Restrict spell casting by the effect’s value: Characters
may not cast spells with effects that have values greater than
a set number. Some options for this set number:
A number picked by the gamemasters, such as 20, which
offers a great range of effects but prevents most spells from
being too game breaking.
Multiple limits — one for each Magic skill — equal to 5 or
6 times the number in front of the D in the skill.
A limit equal to 8 to 10 times the number in front of the
Magic attribute
• Restrict spell casting by the spell’s difficulty: Similar
to limiting by the value of the spell’s effect, this version bases
the limitation on the spell’s difficulty. This version permits a
greater possiblity of game-breaking effects, because designers
can include numerous negative spell modifier, but it can cover
a large range of spells. Use the suggestions in the previous
restriction option for deciding on a limit.
• Stipulate a cost for learning spells: Players of magic
users must pay a Character Point cost for each spell they wish
to learn. Some suggestions for determining the fee:
One Character Point per spell, regardless of difficulty or
effect’s value
A number equal to the difficulty of the spell
A number equal to the value of the spell’s effect
A number equal to a fraction of the spell’s difficulty or
effect’s value, such as one point for every 10 in the difficulty
or effect’s value
• Stipulate a cost for casting spells: Gamemasters may
use the same method as the learning cost option, requiring a
Character Point fee be paid each time spells are cast.
Some gamemasters may prefer a separate pool of magical
points (sometimes called “mana,” “quintessence,” or some
other equally mystical name). The size of the pool depends
on the cost of the spells. If all spells have a cost of one, then
gamemasters can apply the ideas presented in the next option.
For other methods of determining spell costs, the gamemaster
needs to decide which spells will most likely occur in her
adventures and how many times she wants them to appear
each day (or adventure). For costs based on spell difficulty
or effect, a pool equal to 20 times the number in front of
the “D” in the character’s Magic attribute suffices. For costs
based on a fraction of the spell’s difficulty or effect’s value, 2
times the number in front of the “D” in the character’s Magic
attribute is more appropriate.
Mages recover points by resting. Gamemasters can set a
specific number of points that a character gets back from
each hour or period of rest, or they can use the Body Points
chart in the genre rulebooks to determine an amount based
on a roll of the character’s Magic attribute.
• Limit the number of spells a character can know or
cast: With this option, there’s only so much information the
mind can contain. The wizard might be limited in the number
of spells he can cast in a single day, or he may be restricted
in the total number of spells he can learn.

The gamemaster could set a standard number for all magic
users, permitting them to increase this value each time they
improve their Magic attribute.
Alternatively, each character could have an individualized
value based on her Magic attribute, her skills, or both. With
a number based on the attribute, the character can choose
any spell, regardless of the skill required. For numbers based
on skills, the character may only choose spells that fall under
the skill.
Example: In D6 Bloodshadows, the number of spells a
character begins with depends on both the attribute and the
skills. Characters get one spell for each full die in the attribute and one spell for each full die that the skill is above tthe
attribute. If a character has 1D+1 in the Magic attribute and
2D+2 in the divination skill, he could get one spell of any type
and one divination spell — one for the full die in the attribute
and one for the full die above the attribute in the skill.
Gamemasters who limit their characters to a number of
spells per day should allow mages to learn multiple instances
of the same spell.
Mages replenish their spell stock or learn different spells
after several hours of complete rest.
• Require that Magic skills are focused: Characters
know how to cast only certain types of spells. Spells are
divided into different schools, and each school has spells
that use each of the different skills. This multiplies by a great
degree the number of skills a magic user needs to cast every
spell. The range of spells a character has at her disposable is
reduced, and she must spend more study time and Character
Points learning additional focused skills.
See the “Magic” chapter of the D6 Bloodshadows worldbook or page XX of this book for information on focused
Magic skills.
• Make casting spells increasingly difficult: The body
isn’t designed to channel too much mystical energy at once
or that each area has only so much energy within it. Casting spells becomes increasingly difficult the more the mage
performs them and the less the mage rests or lets the area
recover.
Gamemasters can simulate this by adding a cumulative
difficulty modifier to each spell beyond the first. The modifier generally starts at 5, 10, 15, or more — the higher the
number, the faster the mage tires or the area is depleted. Each
spell after the first adds the base modifier plus any modifier
to the previous spell.
Example: The gamemaster sets the difficulty modifier at
5. The first spell is cast at its specified difficulty. The second
spell has a +5 to its difficulty. The third spell has a +10 to its
difficulty. The sixth spell has a +25 to its difficulty.
The mage or area may recover after a number of minutes
equal to the modified difficulty of the spell. Or, it may take
half a day or more of rest from mystical activities for the
renewal to happen.
• Make failing a spell interesting: Create a chart listing
possible results of failing a spell. Associate each result with a
level of failure, which can either be a single number or a range

Example Spell Failure Results
Failure Result*
1–3
4–7
8–10
11–15
16+
		
		
		
		
		
		

Effect
The components or techniques were faulty and, though the spell worked, something went wrong
(not as potent, demon harder to control than expected, visible but not harmful side effect,
etc.).
Though the spell worked, something went wrong (as above) and the character cannot use magic
for a number of minutes equal to 10 times the Failure Result.
The spell doesn’t work, plus the character cannot use magic for a number of hours equal to 2 times
the Failure Result.
The spell doesn’t work, and the character receives backlash from the spell and takes an amount
of damage equal to the difficulty of the spell. This damage may be resisted as normal.
The spell doesn’t work and something really bad or really interesting happens. Some ideas
include:
• Temporary dementia: Roll one Wild Die. This is the number of hours the character suffers from
hallucinations, paranoia, loss of mental capacity, and general madness (the character should be
“less than effective” or helpful to his party during this time, akin to a rank 2 Disadvantage).
• The character feels terribly drained. If she has any Character Points, one is immediately lost,
spend unconsciously (with no effect). In addition, she gets a -2 to her damage resistance totals.
This modifier will not heal until she has taken at least a week of rest.
• Temporary amnesia: The gamemaster determines, either randomly or by choice, five skills that
the character “forgets” how to use for a number of hours equal to the roll of a Wild Die.
• The character suddenly feels powerful. For the rest of the adventure, the character treats all
Critical Failures as results of 1, with no accompanying bad effect.
• The character is unknowingly attuned to the cosmos. The character’s next roll is treated as if he
spent a Fate Point.
• The character suffers from terrible luck and gets one rank of the Bad Luck Disadvantage permanently.

* Determine the Failure Result by rolling a number of dice equal to the difference between the spell difficulty and the
skill total. Gamemasters may wish to use the Die Code Simplification chart from page 142 of the genre rulebooks.
For a more detailed failure results chart, see page 76 of D6 Bloodshadows.
of numbers. Gamemasters can use the chart by subtracting
the failed roll from the difficulty and using this number either
as a direct value or to find a random value.
For a direct value, the gamemaster simply cross-references
the number with the chart to find the result.
For a random value, the gamemaster rolls a number of
dice (including the Wild Die) equal to difference between
the skill roll and the difficulty. This random value is then
checked on the chart.
Example: When Leta attempts the XX spell, which she
recently learned, her player rolls the character’s divination
skill and gets a Critical Failure on his Wild Die. The gamemaster decides to have the player total the dice as normal,
which gives a skill total of 17, lower than the spell difficulty
of 22. The gamemaster subtracts 17 from 22 and gets 5.
He rolls five dice, including a Wild Die, and totals them. He
then looks up the result on the “Abbreviated Spell Failure
Results” chart.
The direct value has the benefit of one less step. The random
value allows for a more detailed chart.

The included example spell failure results chart has been
adapted from D6 Bloodshadows. (For a more detailed chart,
see page 76 of the D6 Bloodshadows worldbook.) It’s suitable
for either method.
Note that not everything on the chart is bad — it’s possible to have positive effects from a magical backlash, though
that’s a rare development. In addition, characters who end up
with totals between 1 and 3 suffer few ill effects from failing,
making this method of determining “magical consequences”
a fairly attractive one.
Gamemasters may choose to alter some of the point spreads
listed on the “Example Spell Failure Results” chart, add more
spreads, and substitute or add in their own effects. Generally, effects should not completely cripple or kill a character
(there are those that do, but they are fairly few), but they
should be pretty negative.

Skills and Effects

Skills
Alteration
Alteration governs magic involving change. Change means
taking something that exists and modifying it or mutating
it into something else. It must work with things that are
already there. A magic spell used to increase a character’s
attribute would be an alteration spell, as would one that
converts a stream of water into a stream of acid. Alteration
could enhance, reduce, or restrict a character’s existing skills,
attributes, Special Abilities, Disadvantages, and so on.
Effect Examples: modifier to a skill or attribute; additional
levels of a Special Ability the target already has; new Limitations or Enhancements on an existing Special Ability; damage
modifier; Armor Value modifier; transmutation. Alteration
spells may not directly affect movement skills.
Some Special Abilities and Disadvantages that modify
existing characteristics fall under alteration rather than conjuration, even if the spell is not intended to give additional
ranks of the Special Ability or Disadvantage. Some examples
include: Advantage Flaw, Hindrance, Language Problems,
Reduced Attribute, Endurance, Enhanced Sense, Hardiness,
Immunity, Increased Attribute, Iron Will, Master of Disguise,
Sense of Direction, Skill Bonus, Skill Minimum, and Youthful
Appearance. Transmutation and Shapechanging in which the
caster (not the target) controls the ability also come under
the purview of alteration.
(((sidebar)))

Choosing Spell Skills
When creating spells using the D6 Magic system,
players may occasionally have problems deciding what
spell skill a mage is going to have to use when casting
the spell. That’s understandable — the lines are a little
blurry sometimes.
The first thing to to do is to take a look at the effect.
That’s the meat of most spells — it’s what determines
how strongly the spell will affect the “target.” What
difficulty, skill, attribute, or value is the effect’s value
going to be measured against? What will your effect’s
value do to that attribute or value?
Thinking of the spell in these terms can help players
guess at those “marginal” spells. And, if the gamemaster
or player decides later that the skill isn’t correct, no
problem: Magic is an art, not a science. Someone who’s

accidentally created an alteration spell that should have
been conjuration has made an “aberration in the art,”
not a precedent.
(((sidebar)))

Apportation
Apportation governs the controlled movement of targets
from one place to another. Calling a dagger from a box at
home to your hand is apportation, as is teleporting yourself
to another place. Spells that restrict movement would also
be apportation spells.
Apportation is not conjuration — the object or the creature
summoned is in existence at the time the spell is cast; the
apportation spell simply “calls” the object or creature.
Most apportation spells simply list the desired maximum
weight the caster wants to move. The range is then the
maximum distance at which the spell “reaches out and grabs”
the target.
If the speed is less than the range, then the object moves
toward the caster at the listed speed. If anything gets in
the target’s way, and there’s no opening within a meter to
either side of the trajectory, the target stops. (Lucky for the
target, it’s only uncomfortable until the spell ends. Unless
it’s a feature of the spell, the magic protects the target from
taking harm.)
If the speed equals the range, then the object is teleported
instantly to within one meter of the caster.
Some apportation spells also list a distance (along with
a weight) in their effects. This allows the caster to move an
item that’s far away to another location, also far away. The
range, in this case, is only from the caster to the target’s
starting position.
Apportation spells that move items from one dimension
to the another generally only list the planar distance. Nonetheless, since this can get pretty powerful, gamemasters
may require that dimensional spells that move objects also
include the objects weight, while those that move people or
creatures allow a chance for those targets to resist (and no
weight value is needed).
Characters or creatures targeted by apportation spells have
a chance to resist the movement. (Nonsentient beings do not
get this resistance roll.) There are two ways to do this:
1. The apportation spell uses compulsion. The skill total
is compared to the target’s willpower/mettle (or governing
attribute) in much the same way a persuasion attempt would

be used — the target’s attitude toward being apported must
be assessed, and the spell works as if it were “persuading”
the target.
2. The apportation skill total has to overcome the target’s
weight value. (Look up the target’s mass on the “Spell Measures” table.) The target can resist by rolling her lifting/lift
(or the governing attribute) and adding it to her weight value
(theoretically, she tries to make herself harder for the spell to
grasp). (Resisting does not count as an action for the target
character.) If the apportation total is equal to or higher than
the weight value, the character is apported. (Naturally, the
spell won’t work on a target that weighs more than the value
listed in the effect.)
Effect Examples: weight of material moved; distance
moved; speed at which target moves; modifiers, Skill Bonus
or Skill Minimum Special Abilities, or Disadvantages to movement skills and Move; Hypermovement Special Ability.

Conjuration
Conjuration magic involves producing something from
nothing. Conjured items and characteristics remain in existence for the duration of the spell.
Conjuration is not used to bring things from one place
to another — that is apportation. A spell that increases a
character’s attributes from a value other than 0D would be
an alteration spell.
A spell that produces something out of thin air is conjuration. Also, a spell that gives characteristics to a thing that would
not normally have those characteristics (or anything to start
with) would be a conjuration skill. For example, animating a
corpse and giving it attribute values (corpses have all normal
attributes at a value of 0D), would be a conjuration skill, since
you are producing something from nothing.
Gamemasters should require that the more complex an item
is, the higher the other alterant aspect should be. Requiring
a separate skill roll to determine familiarity with the object is
also appropriate. Generous gamemasters may permit casters
to include this skill roll as a other conditions aspect. (This
other conditions aspect should always equal no more than
half of the other alterant aspect value.)
Effect Examples: amount of material created; new or
stand-alone skills or attributes (skills or attributes that do
not modify an existing skill or attribute); new Disadvantages; new Special Abilities; skills and attributes included
in conjured items; damage or protection not based on an
existing value. However, see the alteration entry herein for
a list of Special Abilites that are more appropriate for that
skill than for conjuration spells. Not that Transmutation and
Shapechanging Special Abilities that the target controls are
considered conjuration, rather than alteration, spells.

Divination
Divination governs magic involving obtaining knowledge. For example, scrying spells, “far-sight” spells, and
“speak with the dead” types of spells are all covered by

divination. Spells that block the obtaining of information are
also divination spells.
Effect Examples: time in the past or future; stand-alone
investigation, search, or tracking skills to discern specific information. Certain forms of the Extra Sense Special Ability are
suitable for divination spells, as are the Illiterate Disadvantage
and Hindrance Disadvantages that relate to languages, speaking, reading/writing, investigation, and scholar.

Learning and Improving
Magic Skills

Guidelines for learning and improving Magic skills are
detailed in the D6 Fantasy and D6 Adventure Rulebooks. If
you have only the D6 Space Rulebook, use the learning and
improvement rules for Metaphysics work just fine.

(((sidebar)))
Special Ability or Die Code?
Whenever deciding whether to use a Special Ability or a die code, it’s generally better to go with the
method with the higher value. Generous gamemasters
may opt for the verions with the lesser value if the
spell is complicated and would otherwise have a high
difficulty — for example, a spell that provides several
minor effects.
(((sidebar)))

(((sidebar)))
Drooling Idiot Learns Magic!
By default, a player can create a starting character
that’s basically a drooling idiot with a high Magic
attribute and high Magic skills. The player can then
create spells boosting the other attributes, allowing
the character to pretend she’s normal.
What’s a gamemaster to do?
Those who don’t mind dealing with players who like
to abuse the spirit of the system can liberally sprinkle
their adventures with countermagic spells. The character will become ineffectual for the length of time it
takes her to get her attributes back to normal.
Gamemasters who catch players doing this at character creation can require that the player specify just
how the character got to be so powerful magically. If
the explanation doesn’t mesh with the game world’s
magical traditions, require the player to rework the
character. If the background takes the world traditions
into account, the gamemaster may find some seeds
for adventures and making the player’s character’s life
more challenging.
Other gamemasters may wish to nip this whole ordeal
before it starts. In that case, impose a maximum — such
as 2D or 3D — on any Extranormal attribute. This allows
the character room for growth while permitting her to
cast a goodly number of interesting spells.
((((sidebar)))

Effects

Effects that take place over time: For this category of effects,
you’ll need a duration greater than one round, and you’ll need
to include the focused aspect (just in case the victiim decides
to wander out of the range of the spell).
Negative effects (such as damage) that increase over time:
The best way to simulate this is with Achilles’ Heel. The
quicker the negative effect increases, the higher the rank in
this Disadvantage.
Negative effects that decrease over time: The effect’s value
equals the highest value possible, with the description indicating how quickly the effect loses potency.
Positive effects that increase or decrease over time: In
either of these cases, the effect’s value equals the value at
the highest potential. In the description, explain how the
effect gets to that point.
Simulating poison: Poison is, essentially, damage that
occurs over time. Most of the time, including a duration over
one round and the focused aspect does a fine job. Sometimes,
mages want to get trickier.
To allow a resistance roll each round, use the Achilles’ Heel
Disadvantage instead of the ordinary damage value.
For ingested poisons, include one charge with a ward (the
person eats or drinks the sullied refreshment or touches a
harmful surface). Mages can also allow resistance rolls with
wards, though this roll is for the first encounter with the
item only.
When designing spells, additional ranks of Special Abilities
should be considered uncommon (each rank costs the same
as the first), regardless of how common Special Abilities are
in the rest of the game world.
To determine the effect’s value for divination spells that
provide simple “yes or no” answers (such as a spell that lets
the caster know whether someone is asleep or faking it), use
the “Information Difficulties” or “Observation Difficulties”
charts. The more difficult it would be to discern the answer,
the greater the effect’s value.
Gamemasters may find players abusing attribute modifiers.
There are a few ways to solve this problem:
• increase the non-Extranormal attribute modifier value
multiplier to 6 and the Extranormal attribute modifier value
to 9
• require that the spell use the Increased Attribute Special
Ability or Reduced Attribute Disadvantage, both of which have
higher values than the listed attribute modifier value
• set limits on how much can be altered and for how long
— generally, 1D or 2D for one minute is sufficient for most
reasonable tasks
• do not permit characters to rely on magically enhanced
abilities when casting spells — if it’s neither innate to the
character nor an external assistant (such as a magic wand or
nonmagically enhanced person), the act of casting ignores
all magical bonuses

Spells that give stand-alone non-Extranormal attributes
retain their value multiplier, but they cannot be used on for
anything that already has that attribute. So, for example,
attributes could be given to a stick or incorporated in a golem,
but they could not be applied to a robot.
Spells may not be used to make the effect of another spell
more powerful or reduce the difficulty of another spell. In
system terms, this can unbalance a game. In game world
terms, this activity muchs with the magic of the spells, making them not work properly or at all.
However, spells may require other magical rites to be
preformed for the spell to work at all. Sometimes this is a
complementary spell; sometimes it’s a spell that allows the
target to be perceived.

Disguising Efforts
In a world where battle wizards are common, magic
users are going to come up with ways of hiding their
actions. For the most part, this means designing spells
that do not use components, gestures, incantations, or
other visible side effects. Of course, the result is that
the spells are more difficult to cast.
In other cases, mages create spells that incorporate
“normal” actions into spell requirements (such as having to sing a battle hymn).
Similarly, a wizard can include an other alterant
aspect that disguises the spell’s effect. This aspect acts
as if the spell has a con/bluff skill; thus, the value of the
aspect equals the die code of the skill. When the spell
goes off, the opponent makes an opposed interaction
roll against the spell’s con/bluff. If the opponent’s total
is higher, than she sees the effect for what it is. If the
spell’s total is equal to or higher than the opponent’s,
then the target is fooled.
Finally, talented magicians try to be surreptitious.
Some cloak themselves in an invisbility spell, while others use sleight of hand or con/bluff. The latter instances
naturally require spells that do not use flashy gestures
or loud incantations.
(((sidebar)))

Values for Miscellaneous Effects
Changing Scale: To alter the target’s scale, use the Size
Advantage. (Multiply the rank by 3 to get the effect’s value.)
Be sure to specify whether the new scale is larger or smaller
than the average human, as well as what the final scale is.
To simplify determining the effect. Designers may apply this
Advantage to sentient and nonsentient targets.
Extranormal Attributes: In general, no spell should
provide a character with an Extranormal attribute, especially
when a skill would be work just as well. However, there might
be instances (such as the creation of a familiar) when the
player and gamemaster both decide that an Extranormal
attribute is appropriate. The value multiplier for adding an
Extranormal attribute is 4.

Ignoring Armor: Add 1 to the value multiplier for physical
damage that ignores both magical and nonmagical armor.
Add 0.5 to the value multiplier for damage that ignores only
magical armor (yep —that means that nonmagical armor
works better against such spells than magical does!). Likewise,
add 0.5 to the value multiplier for damage that ignores only
nonmagical armor.

(((sidebar)))
Ignoring Armor
Some spells deal damage that ignores magical armor,
nonmagical armor, or both.
Magical armor includes any protection that’s magical
by nature (such as a protective spell or a gamemastercreated artifact) or magically enhanced (such as
protection upon which a spell has been placed that
enhances its ability to fend off magical attacks, as well
as the Natural Armor Special Ability with the Magically
Empowered Enhancement).
Nonmagical armor includes all other kinds of protection.
(((sidebar)))
Stun Damage: Because stun damage injures a character
less than regular damage, the value multiplier is less. After
figuring out the value for the die code of damage, multiply
it by 0.75 to get the value of the effect. (Determining the
consequences of stun damage can be found in the “Damage”
chapter of the genre rulebooks.)
Stealing Points: Spells that take away Character and
Fate Points use the alteration skill. A Character Point has
a value of 6 (per point). Stealing a Fate Point has a value
of 9 (per point). A spell cannot take more points than the
character has.

New Uses of Hindrance
Hindrance (and its related Disadvantage Reduced Attribute) are great ways of adding difficulty modifiers to spells.
Not only do they force spell designers to be more specific in
their wording of the effect, they are also more costly than
simply tacking on an ordinary difficulty modifier.
This list provides general descriptions of some Hindrances
that affect broad categories of skills (rather than specific
skills). When including any of these Hindrances in a spell
or character, be more specific as to the cause of the problem
(such as “blindness” instead of “impaired sitght”).
Hindrance: Initiative (R1), -2 to all initiative totals
Hindrance: Impaired Foot or Leg (R3): +1 to the difficulty
of any foot/leg-related skill use and -1 to initiative rolls
Hindrance: Impaired Hand or Arm (R6): +1 to the difficulty
of any hand/arm-related skill use
Hindrance: Impaired Voice (R7), +3 to difficulties of
actions requiring a voice, such bargain, charm, con, command,
intimidation, languages/speaking, and persuasion
Hindrance: Impaired Sight (R3), +1 to difficulties of all
sight-dependent actions

Hindrance: Impaired Hearing (R3), +2 to difficulties of all
hearing-dependent actions

(((sidebar)))
Stand-alone vs. Modifier
Stand-alone skills, attributes, damage, protection,
and so on do not affect any similar characteristic that
the target or user has. Rather, they nearly always take
the place of any like characteristic. Exception: When
a normally beneficial spell would make a character
worse — such as a spell that provides a Special Ability
that the character already has at a higher rank — then
the character uses the higher value (in this case, hers).
However, if the spell provides something additional
not reflected in the brief description of the effect —
such as the search skill conferred by most divination
spells — then the character uses the skill and the value
listed in the spell.
Modifiers for characteristics always affect the
named characteristic. However, not every character
has every ability.
For modifiers to Special Abilities, Advantages, Disadvantages, attributes, or particular types of damage
or protection, the spell has no effect on targets who
don’t possess the approprate feature.
For skill modifiers, add the bonus to the governing
attribute when the character doesn’t normally have
any dice in the skill.
(((sidebar)))

Determining Effects for
Unknowns

In some spells, particularly dimension-hopping ones, the
creator needs to know the “distance” between the plane of her
world and the “target” realm. In some cases, that distance is
decided upon by the designers of the world. However, what
if you’re dreaming up with one of these spells on your own?
How can a spell creator come up with a value she needs to
beat with her effect for a spell to work?
Usually, the gamemaster decides how easy or hard he wants
some task to be. If the gamemaster thinks a spell should be
easy, then it gets a low effect; if he thinks it should be hard,
then, hey, it’s hard.
In general, divination and alteration spells are fairly easy
— you have to beat time values and character totals in
most cases. It’s the apportation and conjuration spells that
should be hard — bringing something to you or sending it
away instantaneously, or creating something out of nothing
should be a trick.
In the end, this magic system for the D6 System is somewhat arbitrary. There are lots of rules, and lots of options,
but only the gamemaster can decide what he’s going to use
and what he isn’t.

Permanent Effects
There has got to be a way to make effects permanent! Well, sure, and which method depends on the
gameaster.
The easy way is to pick a duration value (such as 38 —
for “a year and a day” — or 43 — for 10 years) and stick
with that. However, there then becomes no reason to
have longer duration values, and this could even make
certain spells (such as wiping someone out of existence)
much easier than they should be.
The more difficult but potentially more satisfying way
is to determine how long it takes for the rest of reality
to “believe” in the effect. Usually, once a natural process
begins to break down the conjured or altered item,
the item no longer needs magic to fuel its existence. A
duration of one year (38) is generally a good starting
point for most things, but it might be shorter for weak
objects (such as soft marble) or longer for stronger or
more complex objects (such as gold or animals).
In some cases, the gamemaster may allow a combination of the casting time and the duration to equal the
permanence value, especially if the effect is costly and
the casting time requires a lot of concentration (such as
transforming a golem into a living being).
Whichever method gamemasters and players use,
after the player and gamemaster should determine
a suitable time, the player must also pay a Character
Point cost, because she’s investing some of her “sense
of self” or “sense of reality” into the permanent thing.
The points do not go toward boosting the skill total or
anything else about the spell.
The permanence cost depends on what’s being done.
A spell that alters or adds an attribute, skill, or character
option has a Character Point cost equal to whatever
the cost for improving or getting that characteristic
would be without the magical help. See the “Improving Characters” chapter in any of the genre rulebooks
for cost details.
Although the cost is steep, makes it possible to add
abilities that otherwise would be impossible after
character creation.
For other spells, a permanence cost equal to the
effect’s value works, though the gamemaster may
increase or decrease this depending on the amount
of effort and time away from adventuring (and thus
gaining Character Points) that is involved in casting
the spell.

New Special Ability: Arcane
Knowledge
The character has gained some tutelage in one of
several esoteric areas of study. This knowledge provides
a +2 bonus per rank to all relevant Magic skill totals
(generally ones having to do with casting of related
spells), though only one Arcane Knowledge bonus may
be added to the spell, regardless of how many relate
to it. At the gamemaster’s discretion, the bonus might
also be applied to other related skill totals. Characters
may not gain this Special Ability through a spell. Base
Special Ability Cost: 1.
There are 20 Arcane Knowledges described here for use in
the Bloodshadows universe. Though they encompass virtually
any type of spell or knowledge, they may be expanded on by
the gamemaster.
Air: This encompasses almost all substances that are gases
at room temperature (save water vapor).
Animal: All nonintelligent creatures who live on or in the
ground are considered to be animal.
Aquatic: This knowledge covers all nonintelligent marine
life as well as amphibians.
Avian: This knowledge encompasses all nonintelligent
flying creatures, including insects and bats. Creatures capable
of flight only because of magical natures are considered to
be enchanted (see herein), rather than avian.
Darkness: The absence of light is darkness. As the presence of darkness acts to make the known the unknown, it
has long been identified with Chaotic magic.
Death: The essence of non-existence, destruction, decay,
and corruption, death is not regarded as evil by most mages,
simply as another step in nature’s path. But all too often,
death magic is used to pervert nature, particularly when
reanimating the dead.
Dimension: Spells that involve the fabric of one’s space
in some way — breaching it, sealing it, or traveling through
it — are governed by dimension. The gamemasters may
allow the bonus from this Arcane Knowledge to be added
to Knowledge and Perception skills in an effort to find one’s
way through or survive in a strange dimension after gating
or teleporting.
Dreams: Dreams concentrates on images in the mind of
a sleeper, whether the caster or another. While essentially
illusory, these images can have a physical effect on the “real
world,” in particular, the body.
Earth: This knowledge includes soil, rock, glass, ceramics,
and anything else made from earthen components. Note that
metals do not come under this heading, as they have their
own Arcane Knowledge.
Enchanted: Beings whose essential natures are magic,
such as elementals, fall under the heading of enchanted. This
knowledge also governs shapeshifters and those zombies and
other creatures that are now mobile because of a spell. Note

that it does not apply to most breeds, as in general they mix
the blood of two folk species, or one folk and one other.
Entity: This knowledge covers beings who have never
truly lived (such as demons and golems), those who have no
physical body now and yet remain on this plane of existence
(such as ghosts), and those whose existence runs contrary
to nature (such as undead).
Fire: Any form of combustion is governed by the fire
Arcane Knowledge. Note that heat without flame is governed
by inanimate forces.
Folk: All intelligent beings whose defining relationship is
with their own kind and who are a part of the natural world
(Marl) are folk. See the sidebar for suggestions on determining what is folk.
Inanimate Forces: The forces that affect non-elemental and
non-life conditions, such as magnetism, electricity, kinetics (movement), heat, and cold are governed by inanimate
forces. Note that this knowledge does not affect fireballs or
ice daggers, which are more closely identified with the elements themselves.
Light: Radiant energy that acts upon the eye, making sight
possible, is light. Light also governs other forms of energy,
such as ultraviolet and infrared.
Magic: Magic relates to natural energy that can produce
supernatural effects, when tapped into and used properly.
Magic can be manipulated through gestures, incantations,
and the like, and is not inherently good or evil. Generally,
only spells that do not conform to other Arcane Knowledges
should be considered magic spells.
Metal: Substances of the earth that are pliable when flame
is applied are metal. The metal Arcane Knowledge also governs
metallic elements, such as arsenic or cinnabar.
Plant: Any nonintelligent growing things rooted to the soil
— flowers, hedges, trees — fall under this classification. Plant
also includes vegetation that grows in river or seabeds.
Time: This governs the force that mandates a progression
of events, and both random change and radical change are
capable using this knowledge. That is why time is considered
both an Order and a Chaos knowledge.
Water: Virtually every liquid is governed by the water
knowledge, provided it has water as a component. Ice is also
included under this knowledge, but the act of cooling or freezing something comes under the heading of inanimate forces.

Magical Items
Enchanting Items
The spells enchanted into items sometimes use
special versions specifically designed for the item. Use
these guidelines to create your own:
For spells that already must be charged into an
item (such as putting pain into a baton): No modification is necessary.
For spells that have a range and may be cast
from a distance when activated (such as putting
lightning bolt into a cane): Add the Charges modifier to
the Spell Total for the number of charges you want to
include. (Divide by 2 and round up to get the value to
add to the spell difficulty.) For instance, two improved
charges adds +10 to the Spell Total or +5 to the spell
difficulty.
For spells that originally have a range but
now must hit a target to activate (such as putting
incinerate into a knife): Multiply the spell difficulty by
2 to get the Spell Total. Reduce the Range and Speed to
zero, and subtract both of these values from the Spell
Total. Add the Charge modifier to the Spell Total for
the number of charges you want to include. Include
an Other Conditions modifier of -2 for “must make
successful attack to release.” Divide the final modified
Spell Total by 2 to get the new difficulty.
Example: Incinerate has a spell difficulty of 15, a
range of 5 meters, and a speed of +4. Its Spell Total is
30. To put it into a weapon, subtract 4 for the range, 4
for the speed, and 2 for the new other conditions. Add 5
for one improved charge. The final modified Spell Total
is 25 (30 – 4 – 4 – 2 + 5) for a spell difficulty of 13.
Basic charges cost less (about one point per charge)
but disappear after 24 hours. Improved charges cost
more (five points per charge), but they have no fade
rate. For more information on basic and improved
charges, see the “Magic” chapter of this book.

Enchant Weapon
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Metal, magic
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 5 (+1D damage)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 60 years (+47)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:

Concentration (-6): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 12
Feedback (-2): -2 to damage resistance total
Focused (+10): On weapon
Incantations (-4): Repeat enchanting phrase for duration
of casting (litany; willpower/mettle roll with difficulty
of 15)
The enchanting of even the weakest of magical weapons
can be a daunting task for a mage. Draining mentally, emotionally, physically, and magically, it’s no wonder that there’s
always a hesitancy to create such weapons. Nonetheless, such
things are produced, and there are mages willing to sacrifice
their lives for the creation of the prefect weapon, particularly
when it is designed with a specific goal in mind.

Magic Weapon
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Metal, magic
Difficulty: 28
Effect: 18 (+3D damage bonus, ignores nonmagical
armor)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Precious gem (uncommon)
Countenance (-1): Target surrounded by faint blue glow
Focused (+8): On weapon
Gestures (-1): Make swinging motion (simple)
A faint blue glow embodies the weapon being enchanted
when this spell is cast. This transforms the normal into the
enchanted, making it possible to do damage to those creatures
that are invulnerable to normal weapons. Furthermore, the
spell ignores nonmagical armor. When successfully cast, the
target weapon gains a +3D damage bonus.

Potions
Creating Your Own Potions
Alchemical potions can be built using the Magic
rules in Chapter 11 of the D6 Adventure Rulebook.
Specifically, an alchemist is charging the potion with
the ability to produce a certain effect. Since most
potions are designed to be splattered on an opponent
or consumed, they need only be charged for one use.
They also needed to be warded, because they go off only
when removed from their container. For charges that
do not lose their potency within a day after making
them, use the improved variation of charges described
in the “Magic” chapter of this book.
It should go without saying, but just in case there’s
any doubt: a potion requires at least two components,
one of which must be either a liquid or a solid.
To figure out the component modifier for the spell,
add 1 to the Availability Rating. The rarer the ingredients in a potion, the longer it may take to produce,
but the easier it will be to charge overall.
Most components are destroyed when the potion
is released, so the components get the “destroyed”
modifier as well.
The container does not count as a component,
because it generally doesn’t matter what the potion is
poured into. However, the potion could need a specific
type of pot, which would be a component.
The range and speed of a potion’s spell are both
zero, because the effect of the spell after it’s released
doesn’t travel a distance. A potion in a container is
considered to be in a dormant form. If the alchemist
wishes to have the effect travel outward from where
the potion was activated, she uses the area of effect
aspect, generally “sphere.”
For a potion that travels with its target (such as a
sticky or ingested one), include the focused aspect.

Alchemical Ingredients
The specific ingredients needed to produce an alchemical
potion can be purchased from apothecaries in small (usually
30-gram) bags and then mixed together, or the potions can
be bought ready-made.
Note that all ingredients are not available in the same
quantities in all cities — each substance listed in the sidebar
has an Availability Rating of 1 to 4. A 1 means the substance is extremely common and easy to find; a 2 means it is
somewhat less common, and will only be found in mid-sized
and larger cities; a 3 means it is relatively rare and will only

be found in large and well-stocked cities; a 4 means it is very
rare and will only be found in a few of the larger cities, or it
may have to be found in the Wilderness.
Most alchemical potions are mixed in water or some other
liquid (which will be listed) to be effective, though there are
some alchemical “dusts” designed along the same lines as
liquid potions.
The container of choice — a small, thin-glass vial with a
little cork or rubber stopper — has a price difficulty of Very
Easy (1 ven). It can be thrown for a range of: Physique-4/
Physique-3/Physique-1. It breaks on impact. Other containers
should have lower ranges, possibly with an increase to the
combat difficulty to reflect a greater material toughness.
This nonexhaustive list can help players and gamemasters
determine the most appropriate component modifier for an
item. Naturally, gamemasters should adjust this for their
worlds — in a setting where the production of alcohol is
banned, the Availability Rating will be much higher than on
a world where it’s sold at the corner market.
When two or more items are considered appropriate as
components (such magnets and lodestones), then use the
component modifier of the lesser item or, if they have the
same rating, then one less than that rating.
Some components are actually broad categories (such as
candles and animal bones). The listed rating is appropriate
when bones from any type of item in that category can be
used. Increase the rating the more specific and rarer the type
of item needed is.
Alcohol (2)
Alum (3): An astringent powder, a double sulfate
of potassium and aluminum.
Amber (3)
Animal Bones (2)
Antimony (2): A silvery-white, brittle, metallic
element, used as a hardening agent.
Arsenic (2): A silvery-white, brittle and extremely
poisonous element, usually found in the form of a
powder.
Aqua Regia (3): A mixture of nitric and hydrochloric
acids, so powerful it can dissolve gold or platinum.
Aquamarine (3): A transparent, pale-blue crystal
only slightly related to quartz, this stone is most often
used in water and air spells.
Ash (1)
Bat Claws (1): Like many alchemical ingredients,
misnamed. Bat claws can be the talons of a bat, rat, or
other rodent and are sold in small jars by apothecaries.

Bell (1)
Belladonna (3): A poisonous plant with reddish,
bell-shaped flowers and black berries, also known as
nightshade. Can only be found in the wild (at least the
useful stuff).
Blood (1)
Brass (2)
Brimstone (1): A pale yellow element that burns
bright blue and gives off a horrendous odor. This stink
explains why so many alchemists face eviction on a
regular basis.
Butterfly Cocoon (3)
Candle (1): An illumination tool made of beeswax,
soy, paraffin, or similar flammable material. Generally
cylindrical with a wick of cotton in the center.
Chalk (1)
Charcoal (1)
Cinnabar (4): A heavy, bright red mineral, the
principal ore of mercury.
Coal (1): A black, combustible mineral formed by
the effects of heat and pressure on decayed plant matter. Comes in rock and dust forms for the same price.
Copper (2): A common reddish-brown, malleable
metal that shines well and is smelted from other
compounds.
Nickel (2): A copperlike ore that contains no copper;
also known as copper demon.
Cotton
Diamond (4): Nearly colorless crystallized carbon,
it makes a convenient focus for many spells. Flaws,
such as cracks or color, can lower the effectiveness of
the stone.
Doll (1): A small figure, generally made of cloth and
resemblilng a human or animal. Rarer dolls have more
abstract forms or are made of less common material.
Earth (1)
Emerald (3)
Fan (1)
Feathers (1)
Fire (1)
Fish Scales (2)
Glass (1): Clear and colored glass is a cheap alternative to fancier stones. The glass must be without
bubbles or other flaws to be useful in spells.
Gold (3): A potion that calls for gold wants pure
gold, not alloys or something that was lead this morning. That’s why gold is relatively rare for the purposes
of potions — and efforts to use substitutes often result
in explosions.
Granite (2)
Heliotrope (3): Also known as bloodstone because
of the flecks of red mixed with the base green color,
this special quartz is most often used in vitomancy and
necromancy spells.
Hematite (2): A common form of iron oxide, this
opaque crystal ranges in color from black to gray. It
has mild magnetic properties.

Hemlock (2): A poisonous weed with small, white
flowers.
Henbane, Powdered (2): The ground-up remains of
a coarse, foul-smelling plant known to be poisonous.
Incense (2)
Iron (2)
Ivory (4)
Jade (3)
Lead (1): A heavy, soft, malleable bluish-gray metallic element, used as a base in many alchemical potions.
It’s valued for its ability, when properly treated, to
transmute into other elements, such as gold, if only
temporarily.
Leather (2): Dried animal skin — the less treatment
it’s had, the better it works.
Lime (1): A white powder derived by heating
limestone.
Linen (2)
Lodestone (2)
Magnet (1)
Magnesium (4): A light, silver-white, malleable
metallic element that burns with a hot, white light.
Some northern mines have started searching actively
for it, so the Availability Rating may drop soon.
Mandrake (2): A poisonous plant of the nightshade
family with a short stem and thick root.
Mirror (1): A reflective surface made of glass with a
thin layer of silver applied to the back.
Naptha (1): An inflammable, volatile liquid that
can be distilled from wood, oil, or coal tar.

Obsidian (4): Naturally occurring volcanic glass,
this crystal can be quite sharp.
Oil (1)
Onyx (3)
Opal (3)
Parchment (2)
Pearl (3)
Pitchblende (4): A brown to black mineral containing radium, uranium, and so on.
Platinum (4)
Porcupine Quill (2)
Pumice (2)
Potash (3): Potassium salts, found abundantly in
dangerous salt marshes.
Quartz (2): Quartzes are silicon dioxide crystals,
with clear being the most common. Colored ones are
rarer (increase the Availability Rating by one) and
include carnelian (red), amethyst (purple), chalcedony
(blue- or gray-white), chrysoprase (green), and agate
(banded browns).
Rock Oil (1): Often refined into a combustible
fuel, alchemists have no problem getting “rock oil” in
most cities.
Ruby (3)
Salt (1)

Saltpeter (2)
Sapphire (3)
Seawater (1): If you are on a coastal city, you’re
in luck; if not, add one to the Availability Rating.
Water sprinkled with salt won’t work as a substitute,
though.
Shell (1)
Silver (3): See the notes for “gold,” herein.
Sulphur (3)
Tobacco (1)
Tooth (1)
Tree Sap (1)
Vitriol (2): An oily, colorless, corrosive liquid, also
known as sulfuric acid.
Water (1)
Wine (1)
Zincen (2): Also known as zinc oxide, this white
powder is sometimes used to make glass or paint.

Colors

Requiring that a spell use itmes of a specific color improves
the components modifier by 1. A spell that simply requires
an item to be of a specific color, but the item itself is not
specified, uses a value of -1 for this component.
This list gives some suggestions for types of spells that
work best with particular colors.

Incense

Incense falls under the components aspect and generally
has a value of -3, though rare varieties may command a higher
price and receive a higher aspect value.
This list offers some ideas for varieties of incense that
influence specific kinds of spells.

Flowers and Herbs

Flowers and herbs are types of components that casters can
use to create their spells. Generic “flowers and herbs” have a
value of -1, while specific varieties have a value of -2 (or more,
if great quantities or perfect speciments are needed).
This short list offers some ideas for the types of spells that
work well with particular kinds of flowers and herbs.

Times

Here are some examples of special times for casting spells.
The modifier given is the minimum modifier; the gamemaster
may increase this if the player can make a case that the period
is smaller than the modifier suggests.
It is recommended that, however many time-sensitive
events must exist for a spell to be cast, only the one with
the highest modifier has any effect on the spell’s difficulty
number.
Example
Modifier
Day, night
-1
Particular phase of the moon
-2
Season
-2
During a general celestial event -3
(such as any meteor shower)
Day of the year
-4
(if the locals use a different calendar than the one the
caster designed the spell with, then the date will need to be
correctly translated)
During a specific celestial event -5
(such as the passing of Haley’s Comet)

Locations

Learning Spells

Starting Bloodshadows characters begin with a number of
spells equal to the number in front of the “D” in their Magic
attribute. These spells may rely on any skill.
For each additional full die above the base attribute in
each Magic skill that they have, they may learn one spell
related to that skill.
Example: Chase has 1D+2 in Magic and 3D+1 in conjuration. Since her skill is 1D+2 above her attribute, she gets one
spell for that, which she must put in a conjuration spell. She
also receives one spell for her full die in Magic. She can take
any spell she wants for that slot.
They may fill these slots with any spell with a difficulty
of 10 or less free, or they may try for more difficult spells.
To see if the character learned a more difficult spell, roll the
skill needed to cast the spell. (The player may not spend
Character or Fate Points on this roll.) If the total meet or
beat the difficulty, the character learned it at some point in
her past. Otherwise, she didn’t, and she’ll have to figure it
out the old-fashioned way — through study.
After character creation, characters learn new spells by
either coming up with them on their own, studying them in
grimoires, or getting someone else to teach them. There is no
limit to the number of spells a character may learn (outside
of those dictated by time, energy, and Character Points.)
Regardless of the method used, the amount of time it takes
to master a new spell equals a mastery time. To figure this,
multiply the difficulty of the spell by 1.5 (round up). Then
look up this number as a value on the “Spell Measures” chart
on page 87 and read its equivalent measure on the table. Use
the “Measure Conversions” table to figure out the value in
minutes, days, weeks, months, or years.
Grimoires can decrease the amount of time it takes to
learn the spell (for well-written books) or they can increase
the difficulty to understand the spell (for books containing
inaccurate information). How useful the grimoire is depends
on its quality and is up to the gamemaster.
Teachers must have the spell’s casting skill at a level equal
to or greater than the character’s skill and the teacher must
have already mastered a spell. Each full die above the character’s skill reduces the amount of time it takes to learn the
spell by one value level, with a minimum mastery time value
equal to one less than the spell’s difficulty.
If the character has both a teacher and a grimoire, the
character only receives the bonus for one of the two.
Example: Desken has been doing the detective-mage thing
for a while and he decides to add bloodshadows to his spell
repertoire. He could learn it on his own in about five weeks
(the spell has difficulty of 22, giving it a mastery time of 33).
Or, he could find a teacher with 3D+1 (a full die greater than
his divination/necromancy of 2D+1) and be taught it in about
2.5 weeks (which has a value of 31).
At the end of the mastery time, the character rolls the
spell’s required casting skill, including any modifiers from
alignment or Arcane Knowledge. If she meets or beats the

difficulty and spends one Character Point, she has mastered
the spell. Note that this does not mean the spell was cast — it
was simply learned.
Once a character has mastered a spell, she never has to
spend time relearning it (unless she makes changes to it).
When a character wants to “cast on the fly” and not learn
a new spell, she needs only worry about the design time,
whether she reads it out of a grimoire or makes it on her
own. However, every time she wants to cast that spell, she’ll
have to go through the design process again.

Alternate Magic Systems
Freeform Magic System

For some settings, the full D6 Magic system is overkill. The
freeform variant provides a means of including magic that’s
easy to learn, fast to execute, and quite arbitary, as it relies
largely on the gamemaster to decide on the difficulty.
With this magic system, the attribute and skills remain
the same. When the mage wishes to cast a spell, the player
describes the desired result of the spell and what her character is doing to make the spell come about (incantations,
gestures, components, etc.), if anything. The gamemaster
then takes into account the player’s description and selects
a difficulty number using the “Generic Standard Difficulties”
chart found in each of the genre rulebooks. In general, the
less useful the effect and the more obvious the casting is, the
less difficult the spell is to perform.
If the character’s skill roll meets or beats the difficulty,
spell goes off as planned — possibly better than planned if
the skill roll is must higher than the difficulty. Failure could
result in anything from a fizzled rite to a disastorous and
unforseen consequence.
The gamemaster or player may wish to take notes on spells,
including their difficulties, for those rites that the player
wants her character to repeat in the future. The difficulty
of future attempts of the same spell need not be exactly
the same —the gamemaster can alter the number based on
circumstances (health of the character, environmental distractions, low or high mystical energy area, etc.). Gamemasters
can select suitable modifiers from the “Generic Difficulty
Modifiers” chart.
Gamemasters using the freeform system and at a loss
for how to determine difficulties should skim through this
volume and the D6 Fantasy and D6 Adventure rulebooks for
“sample” spells.

Magic Without Magic

In some settings, just about anyone can channel magic
and perform spells. Often, it’s enough to say that the spell
has been charged (and possibly warded) into a scroll, book
page, or other object. Real magic users devote their lives to
learning the Magic attribute and skills, but they often charge
spells into things to make them easier and faster to use in
the future. It’s these items that folks stumble across.
Occasionally, though, someone comes across a sorcerer’s
notes and somehow manages to trigger a spell or two in the
book, despite everyone know that there’d be no reason for
them to have been charged. Or, an ordinary joe purchases

a love ritual through the mail, uses it, and gets himself a
significant other.
Gamemasters don’t need to say that the casual spell caster
has some latent Magic ability (though it’s possible). Rather,
they can handle these situations one of two ways:
• It’s gameaster’s fiat; the spell goes off because it’s necessary for the plot to progress.
• The character has such a high belief in the rite working
that the gamemaster allows willpower/mettle to be used
instead of a Magic skill to determine the spell’s success. There
should be a difficulty modifier tacked onto this, to reflect that
the person really doesn’t have any idea what she’s doing. A
value of +5 (if casual casters are common) to +10 (if mailorder spells actually working is a rare thing) serves well as a
standard, and gamemasters can futher adjust this based on
how well the ritual was presented to the neophyte.

Ditching the Attribute

Some gamemasters may wish to do away with the attribute
altogether. They may simply have the Magic skills standalone.
(In this case, the first die costs the same as getting 1D in an
attribute. Subsequent dice are increased as normal.)
Alternatively, they can move the Magic skills under other
attributes. Here’s one suggested rearrangement:
• alteration under Presence (D6 Adventure), Charisma (D6
Fantasy), or Perception (D6 Space)
• apportation under Acumen/Perception
• conjuration under Intellect/Knowledge
• divination under Acumen/Perception
In this version, Magic skills can be used untrained (and
default to the governing attribute), but when they do, they
always have an untrained difficulty modifier of at least +5.
Furthermore, they’re twice as expensive as any other skill
to improve.

Basic Spell Creation System

This simple spell creation system is based on the most
popular choices from the full D6 Magic system. It’s completely
compatible with spells from that system, even if it leaves out
a lot of aspects. It makes a good stepping stone for those who
find the detailness of the full system daunting.
To use this system, follow these steps:
1. Choose the skill — alteration, apportation, conjuration, or divination. See page XX of this book for details on
these skills.

2. Choose the effect from the ones listed here under the
skill that you selected. The effect is the main consequence of
casting the spell. If you don’t see the effect you want, pick
one that’s close to what you’d like; ask your gamemaster
to assign a value for the effect you want; or consider that
effect to be beyond your magic-wielding character’s abilities
at this point.
For divination spells that search within an area, you also
need to specify what the spell reveals. The user relies on the
search skill given by the spell against a difficulty determined
by the gamemaster. (Use the “Observation Difficulties” chart
in the rulebooks as a guide for deciding on the difficulty.)
3. Choose the range. The range is the maximum distance
at which the target of the effect can be from the caster of the
spell. For apportation spells, the range is always one meter
(+0). For divination spells, this is how far away the target area
can be from the caster.
4. Choose the duration. The duration is how long the
effect remains in existence. For divination spells, the duration
must be at least one round.
5. Choose the casting time. This is how long it takes for
the magic user to generate the spell each time he casts it.
6. Choose other aspects that you want to include with
the spell. You may also decide that you do not want to include
any of the “other aspects.”
7. Figure out the spell’s difficulty. First, total the
values for all of your choices. Round fractions up. This is
the spell total.
If the spell total is 19 or less and the spell does not have
one of the italicized options, the spell is a cantrip. Divide
the total by 2 and round up. This final number is the spell’s
difficulty.
If the spell total is 20 or greater or the spell is 19 or less
and it does have one of the italicized options, divide the total
by 2 and round up. If the number is less than 10, it becomes
10. This is the spell’s difficulty.
8. Decide on a name for the spell.
All spells:
u Only affect one target
u Have no area of effect (except for divination)
u Cannot move
u Require the ability to see the target (except for divination)
u Require a targeting roll of throwing or apportation (for
ranged effects), brawling/fighting (for hand-to-hand),
or melee combat (for enchanted or conjured weapons); if
the range is “self” or the target is willing, no targeting
roll is required

than the ones designed with the full system; rather, the presentations better reflect this spell creation system’s method.

as specifying one skill to improve) and more colorful.

D6 Magic Primer
Thank you for your interest in applying for enrollment to
the D6 System Magical University. The following information
clarifies what you should already know but will serve as a
good primer for some concepts you might find confusing. This
document does not replace the rulebook, but rather serves as
an explanation of some points many freshmen find confusing.
We have also included some information and commentary
from our Headmaster, the Venerable Deacix Gamemaster.
Remember: Whatever Gamemaster says, goes.
Much of the information here is also good to review for
those seeking to further themselves in the practicing of
miracles by attending the D6 System Universal Seminary,
although some points are different. As ever, consult your
local deity for more clarification.

Creating the Spell

At its most basic, creating a simple spell only requires
six steps:
1) Come up with the Effect and get a number
2) Come up with the Range and get a number; double
that number
3) Come up with the Duration and get a number
4) Add the numbers from Steps 1-3
5) Come up with the Casting Time and get a number
6) Subtract the Casting Time number from total from
step 4.
7) Divide the number from Step 6 by two and round up;
that number is the spell’s difficulty.
There are two broad optional categories:
• Add special abilities and effects that let the spell do
things it couldn’t normally, at the cost of making the spell
harder to cast
• Saddle the spell with restrictions that limit the spell’s
usefulness or make it difficult to cast in some situations, but
allow it to be cast with a lower difficulty number

Come Up with the Effect

Whenever possible, the D6 System concerns itself with
effects rather than causes. The upshot of this is that, whenever possible, effects should be created using the die code
charts. This is especially true with transmutations and
conjurations.
Example: Young magician Harold Poitier is creating a
spell that targets his enemies with an explosion. Without
Gamemaster’s approval, he cannot conjure, say, 25 kilograms
of nitroglycerin; rather, he needs to determine the die code of
the damage he wishes to create and use that as a base number
(probably adding an Area Effect, as will be discussed later).

In general, each effect needs to be paid for separately. For
example, a spell that teleports someone 60 meters in the air,
with the express purpose of causing them damage, would seem
to have an effect of 10 (the weight of an average Human).
However, since the effect is designed to cause damage, its
cost would actually be 120; falling damage deals 1D per 1.5
meters the person falls, so this is actually equivalent to an
attack that does 40D in damage.
What would happen if the spell was designed with a spell
effect value of 10? Well, it depends. Magic is unpredictable.
In all likelihood, the target would teleport 60 meters into the
air, only to flutter harmlessly down a round later. Or maybe
he’d fall with a thump, causing no damage. It’s difficult to
say. However, as the great mage Byzant once said, “There’s
no such thing as a free lunch . . . or a free spell effect.”
Now, that’s not to say a spell can’t have minor effects; rather,
these effects will be, largely, neutral, sometimes helping the
caster and sometimes harming him. For example, a spell
that ignites the caster’s finger like a candle might only have
an effect to produce light; while it might be useful to start
minor fires (perhaps via use of the survival skill), it might also
accidentally cause fires every so often, and beings attracted
to smoke might occasionally detect it.
If a spell ends up having a secondary effect that is used
often – perhaps even at the expense of the primary effect – the
laws of the universe will probably take notice, and the spell
will likely adjust itself to the “new” difficulty number.
One of the biggest “secrets” is the use of the spell effect
to add Disadvantages or Special Abilities (as per “Effect and
Skill Used,” in the Magic chapter). For example,
(((BEGIN SIDEBAR)))

What Magic Skill Do I Use?
Short answer: Whatever makes sense. Gamemaster is
generally permissive when it comes to alternate effects.
For example, adding +2 to three social skills is usually
an alternation effect. However, giving someone a Skill
Bonus: Charismatic accomplishes the same effect, and
since this creates something out of nothing it could be
considered a conjuration effect.
In general, games are better served by not paying
too much attention to the nitty-gritty, as long as the
effect can be justified in some way. However, if a mage
seems to be abusive with this freedom, the gamemaster
is perfectly justified in limiting or prohibiting abusive
applications.
(((END SIDEBAR)))
Sometimes, spell effects need to be tweaked to get reasonable numbers. For example, D6 Bloodshadows and D6 Magic
have new rules regarding the effect of divination spells, in an
effort to make them a little easier to cast.

Casting a Spell

Here’s a refresher course on how to cast spells with the
D6 Magic system:
1. Determine the difficulty of the spell.
2. Generate the appropriate spell skill total.
3. Add the applicable Arcane Knowledge bonus to the spell
skill total to determine the final skill total (if you’re using
this Special Ability).
4. If the final skill total is lower than the difficulty of the
spell, go to Step 5a; otherwise, go to Step 5b.
5a. The spell fails. If desired, the gamemaster may impose
penalties for failing, such as using the “Spell Failures Results”
chart. To use the chart, subtract the final skill total from
the difficulty of the spell. Roll a number of dice equal to
this number to determine the Failure Result (modified by
the alignment of the spell, if the gamemaster wishes). The
gamemaster compares the result to the “Abbreviated Spell
Failure Results” chart and decides on the outcome.
5b. The spell succeeds. Generate a targeting total, if needed.
If that succeeds or if there is no targeting total, assign the
effects of the spell, as described in the spell’s description.
Example: Kathiruth is a small-time con artist and parttime magician. She has a skill value of alteration 4D+1, and
two ranks in Arcane Knowledge: Water. She wants to cast
the spell acid bath.
(Step 1.) The spell has a difficulty of 18.
(Step 2.) Kathiruth gets lucky, generating a skill total of
20.
(Step 3.) She adds in her +4 bonus from her Arcane Knowledge (since the water Arcane Knowledge is listed as applicable
under the spell description), for a skill total of 24.
(Step 4.) The skill total is higher than the difficulty of the
spell, so it goes off.
(Step 5b.) Since acid bath is a damage spell, Downtown
needs to determine whether he hit or not by using throwing
or apportation (either wizardry or the same focus as the spell,
elemental). He may modify the targeting total by the result
point bonus. If he did hit, the effect of the spell dictates the
damage of the attack.

Finding a Spell

With well over 200 different spells, we’ve split them into
nine schools established in the D6 Bloodshadows worldbook.
You can uses these schools as they appear here in your own
campaigns, add more, combine existing schools, or ignore
them completely.
If you decide to uses schools, you might want to have them
as foci of the Magic skills. Foci narrow the existing general
skills, thus limiting the number of spells a character can
cast. To cast a spell in a particular school, the mage needs
the correct focus. The cost of obtaining a focused skill is the
same for those settings that do not use foci; however, in
settings using the magic school option, a caster may never
have the general skill. (For more details on schools as Magic
skill foci, see Chapter 6, “Magic,” in the D6 Bloodshadows
worldbook.)
(((sidebar)))

Schools of Magic
Alchemy: spells that imbue objects (rings, weapons,
potions, etc.) with other spells; alchemists need to know
not only alchemy, but also the school or schools of the
spells they wish to place into objects — this school
gets its own chapter
Chronomancy: spells that deal with time
Elemental: spells that deal with the four elements:
earth, air, fire, and water
Necromancy: spells that deal with the dead
Peregrination: spells that deal with movement
and dimensions
Photomancy: spells that deal with light and darkness
Somniomancy: spells that deal with sleep and
dreams
Technomancy: spells that deal with metal, weapons,
machinery, and the like
Vitomancy: spells that deal with life, including
healing, improving the body, and creating new forms
of life
Wizardry: spells that deal with spells not covered by
other schools, as well as those creatures of a sorcerous
nature (such as most demons)
(((sidebar)))
Within each school, the spells are alphabetized. An alphabetical index of all spells publisehd to date, among other
indices, appears at the end of this book.

Targeting a Spell

Many spells include reminders about which skill to use
when targeting a spell, but for those that don’t, here are
some guidelines.
Most spells that target another unwilling character require
the caster to make an attack roll. Generally, this means a
marksmanship/fireaarms, throwing, or apportation roll (or the
governing attribute, at no penalty, if the character doesn’t
have the needed skill). When the range specifies “touch,” the
character must make a brawling/fighting attempt — no Magic
skill will work in this instance.
Spells with ranges of 10 meters or more have a Short range
limit equal to 25% of the listed range, a Medium range of 50%,
and a Long range equal to the list range. (Round all fractions
up.) Ranges of 3.5 and 5 meters only use Short range (which
equals the listed value). Anything less than 3.5 meters falls
within Point Blank range.
In a few cases, an interaction roll, usually with willpower/
mettle, or resistance roll with stamina is more appropriate.
Note that target may use the governing attribute if she
doesn’t have the skill.
Rolling the targeting skill does not count as a separate
action for determining the multi-action penality.
The targeting roll for a spell is a good way of providing an
opponent with a defense against an attack. Except for actively
dodging combat attacks, the victim doesn’t need to spend an
action to ward off a magical spell. However, the gamemaster
may lower the target’s roll if he decides that there’s an element of surprise to the spell’s casting.
If you wish spells to automatically work, then ignore the
targeting information.

Using a Spell

Mages may rely on the effects of spells with casting times
of one round or longer on their turn in the round after the
end of the casting time. Thus, an offensive spell with a casting
time of one round may be targeted in the round after it was
cast. If the mage waits more than a round after triggering
the spell, the effect of the spell is lost.
Spells that give characters skills or bonuses to use as they
please do count as multi-actions when the character employs
the skill in the same round as casting the spell.
Spells that provide a skill intended for determining the
effect, but over which the user otherwise has no control,
must be used in the same round in which the spell goes off.
This does not count as a multi-action.

Interpreting The Effect
In the D6 Adventure Rulebook, and in the spell descriptions
herein, there are guidelines for determining the effects of
spells. But a little clarification won’t hurt.
When an effect’s value is used as a damage value, never
modify it by result points. In most cases, it doesn’t matter
how well a spell hits a person — just that it does. Instead,
the result point bonus of the spell skill roll should add to its
range or targeting skill total, unless the result points are used
to determine the effectiveness of the spell (such as various
levels of success).
Certain effect will have some unusual rules. That’s fine for
spells listed in this book, but how does someone interpret
spells she creates?
Due to the wide range of spells that can be created, the
player and the gamemaster will have to use their best judgment. In most cases, they can compare what the spell does
to some other, similar game mechanic. For example, a spell
that is designed to control a character’s mind might be said to
intimidate or charm him into submission — so they can use
the rules for intimidation or charm, substituting the effect’s
value of the spell for the skill die code the character would
normally use.

Modifiers & Spell Effectiveness
Difficulty modifiers can increase (or decrease) the effectiveness of a spell. For example, a character who chooses to
throw a spell at a particular part of a target’s anatomy (if the
spell is capable of being that precise) or perform a called shot
can apply these modifiers to the targeting roll.
Likewise, if a character who is being attacked by a damage
spell hides behind applicable cover, the effectiveness of the
spell might be decreased.
Gamemasters and players can check through the “Example
Skill Difficulties” and the “Combat Options” chapters of the
rulebooks to select other applicable modifiers, which might
affect the targeting or usage skill roll or the roll of any skill
provided by the spell.

Chronomancy
(((sidebar)))
Chronomancy Caution
Mucking with time is a powerful ability. Most gamemasters should restrict its availability in their games,
especially to starting characters. Characters should be
required to obtain experience in chronomancy magic,
whether this is represented only by roleplaying adventures with a master or it requires the acquisition of the
time Arcane Knowledge Special Ability.

Chronal Fog
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: magic, time
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 15 (Armor Value of 5D, physical only)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+10): Sphere with radius of 2 meters
Components (-8): Three grams of mica flakes (uncommon,
destroyed)
Focused (+4): On caster
Gestures (-2): Twirls arms around while dispersing the mica
flakes to form a ring around the caster (fairly simple)
Incantations (-3): “Mists of time, clouds of fate, shield me
now, for the hour is late!” (sentence, loud)
Upon the dispersal of the spell component, a foglike haze
surrounds the magic wielder. The haze is formed by the chronal
echoes that emanate from the fluctuating temporal fields that
the mage summons to deflect physical damage. The barrier
is centered upon the caster and provides an Armor Value of
5D against all types of physical (not mental) attacks. The
fog effect of the spell offers the same visibility limitations
of light fog for both the magic wielder and those who wish
to peer through it.

Chronobolt
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: death, time
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 30 (5D physical damage, ignores all armor)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 second (+0)
Casting Time: 1 second (-0)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): A small hourglass (uncommon)
Gestures (-2): Hold an hourglass before the intended target
and shake the sand inside it (fairly simple)

Incantations (-2): “The future beckons, come and embrace
the pain. You now shall suffer, tis victory I gain!” (sentence)
The successful casting of a chronobolt allows the temporal
manipulator to create an aura that causes a portion of the
intended target to move slightly forward in time. (This also
means that no armor protects against the bolt.) The chronal
disturbance does 5D in damage to the victim from a range
of up to 10 meters from the caster. She must make a marksmanship/firearms or apportation roll to hit the target. The bolt
must be fired in the same round that the spell is cast. After
spell effects have been resolved, the target suffers no further
ill effects from the temporal disturbance.
The caster cannot choose which portion of the victim is
moved further in time. Such things are totally random, and
in some cases, may be portions of the target’s molecular
structure instead of a limb or section of the body.

Detect Resonance
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: time
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 9 (Extra Sense: Chronal Energy (R3), +3D to search
and investigation for chronal energy)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+21): Divination sphere with radius of 25
meters
Components (-12): An astrolabe with quartz lenses
(uncommon); 18 grams of diamond dust (uncommon,
destroyed)
Gestures (-4): Toss the diamond dust in the air and views
the area with the astrolabe (complex; investigation difficulty of 11)
Incantations (-2): “Though the temporal winds run wild
and free, through its shadowy wake, I now clearly see!”
(sentence)
When successfully cast, the arcane aid can provide a mage
with one of the following pieces of information, which the
mage chooses at casting.
1. He could discover the existence of things that are out
of sync with the time stream in a given area, such as time
travelers or extradimensional creatures that exist out the
normal range of vision.

2. He could reveal the existence of active chronal enchantments that are bedeviling a tortured soul.
3. He could decide to employ this magic to discover hidden chronal gates and gain entrance to other times. Such
ventures have their own risk however, as those who travel
through such devices to other times without taking proper
precautions could unwittingly release time-lost horrors.
The difficulty to find the chronal energy is 11, with higher
results indication more information. The range and area of
effect of the spell indicate the maximum effectiveness of the
newly acquired sense.

Devolution
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: animal, folk, time
Difficulty: 23
Effect: 12 (Reduced Attribute: Knowledge/Intellect (R4), -1D
to the attribute)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-6): 60 grams of brain matter, which may
come any recently deceased creature as long as the matter
retains at least its cranial fluid (common, destroyed)
Focused (+3): On target
Gestures (-2): Crush brain matter and fling at the target
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-2): “Time rolls back to reveal the shame of
your lowly ancestors!” (sentence)
Variable Efffect (+27): Up to an additional nine ranks of
Reduced Attribute: Knowledge/Intellect (which means
up to an additional -3D to the attribute)
Devolution digs deep into the ancestral memories of the
intended victim in order to flood her mind with horrific
images of what her primordial ancestors once were. The oft
barbaric visions can deliver a devastating blow to the victim’s
psyche and rattle her resolve.
When casting this spell, the mage crushes the brain matter
in his hand and flings the remains at the target. If the target
cannot beat the caster’s spell skill total with a willpower/
mettle roll, the victim loses up to 4D of Knowledge/Intellect
(minimum adjust attribute value of 1D) for five rounds while
her mind reels as it psychically regresses.

Diminish
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: magic, time
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 14 (reduces the duration of a chosen spell by 10
minutes)
Range: 15 meters (+6)
Speed: Instantaneous (+6)
Duration: 1 second (+0)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)

Other Aspects:
Components (-1): 1-decimeter square cloth (ordinary)
Gestures (-2): Mime wiping away something with the cloth
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): “Arcane blight, begone!” (phrase)
Other Conditions (-1): Must specify at casting a single
spell to target
The successful casting of diminish reduces the duration
of the targeted spell by up to 10 minutes. When a caster
attempts to affect a given spell, compare the skill total used
to cast diminish to the skill total used to create the offending spell. If the diminish spell total is equal or higher than
the targeted spell’s skill total, the spell duration is reduced.
Spells with 10 minutes or less of duration left on them cease
to function. Only one diminish spell can reduce the duration
of any particular spell.

Erosion
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: death, time
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 18 (6D physical damage)
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)
Duration: 1 second (+0)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+5): Sphere with radius of 1 meter
Components (-2): A gram of sand (ordinary, destroyed)
Gestures (-1): Fling sand at the target area while the
incantation is uttered (simple)
Incantations (-2): “Time the healer, time the stealer, once
thought by all to forever last, now it is most assuredly
past.” (sentence)
Other Conditions (-1): Affects nonliving matter only
Erosion allows the chronomancer to rapidly accelerate the
breakdown of nonliving matter. Upon the successful casting
of this spell, a mage may cause a small sphere’s worth of
material to crumble to dust as it succumbs to the onslaught
of time. Any living matter in the affected area is unharmed
by the spell, although any structural effects caused by the

magic may still be dangerous. Erosion can be utilized topple
large structures and cause general chaos for the unwary.
The availability of erosion’s material component makes the
magic popular for mages who find themselves imprisoned.
Thus, it is not uncommon for jailers who have experience in
confining wizards to bind and sometimes keep their charges
blindfolded for the duration of their incarceration.

Loophole
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: magic, time
Difficulty: 29
Effect: 45 (+6D to one Magic skill and affecting one spell,
specified at spell casting, that the target wishes to cast
quickly)
Range: 3.5 meters (+3)
Speed: Instantaneous (+3)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): A 30 cubic centimeter vial of ink (very
common, destroyed)
Feedback (-1): -1 to damage resistance total
Focused (+10): On target
Gestures (-1): Fling the ink at target while uttering the
incantation (simple)
Incantations (-1): “Quickly cast quiet creations.”
(phrase)
Other Conditions (-1): Not usable on spells with incantations, gestures, or concentration requirements
Every once in a while, one just does not have enough time
to deal with the current situation and needs a little help from
a friend. Loophole serves just this purpose as it causes time
around the intended target to “blink.” This effect hastens
the recipient forward in time, which allows the person to
shorten the casting time of one spell by 75% (round up, with
a maximum reduced casting time ofone minute). The spell
difficulty increases by +20, but the target’s skill increases
by 6D to compensate for this. The recipient of this spell
can perform no other action outside of the casting of the
intended spell.
The ink disappears once the target casts the spell.

Lotus Dreams
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: dreams, time
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 21 (Accelerated Healing (R7), +7D bonus to natural
healing attempts)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:

Components (-8): 3 grams of incense made from crushed
lotus petals (uncommon, destroyed)
Countenance (-1): Skin turns an unhealthy pale tone for
the duration of the spell
Focused (+9): On target
Gestures (-3):Gently closes the eyes of the recipient and
traces the lines of the bony plates that compose the skull
of the intended recipient as the incantation is uttered
(complex; sleight of hand roll with difficulty of 11)
Incantations (-2): “Though your mortal form has been
rent asunder, embrace life and drink deeply from the
draught of endless slumber.” (sentence)
Other Alterants (+4): Target cannot be awakened
When this magic is successfully cast upon a willing recipient, the target falls into a deep, coma-like slumber that lasts
for a full 24 hours. After the recipient awakens from his liferenewing respite, the spell’s effect grants him a +7D modifier
to natural healing roll for the day.
During the spell’s duration it is impossible for the recipient
to waken or be awakened normally. Those with telepathic or
similar powers can contact them mentally but the answers
given come sluggishly and are typically one or two words.
This is in addition to aging from the normal passage of
time. Although uncommon, it is not unheard of for those
who emerge from the lotus dreams induced sleep to complain
of experiencing a vertigo effect during the spell. Some are
hesitant to receive the benefits of the spell a second time
unless they are near death.

Perceptive Flux
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: time
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 15 (Hindrance: Initiative (R5), -10 to all initiative
totals)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): A gram of sandstone (very common,
destroyed)
Countenance (-1): Skin turns a sickly gray color for the
duration of the spell
Gestures (-2): Crush sandstone and drop it to the floor
(fairly simple)
Multiple Targets (+15): Up to 5 targets
Perceptive flux is an extremely useful spell for covert operations as it can give strike teams a definite tactical advantage.
Although it takes some time to prepare the magic, the spell’s
lack of verbal aspects can make it well worth casting.
At the end of a successful casting, the opponents think it’s
a different time than it actually is, causing several seconds
of disorientation.
The minimum initiative total an opponent can generate is
zero, which means that he goes last in the round.

Push
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: time
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 14 (sends a small object up to 10 minutes into the
future)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-2): Wave one hand across the object to be pushed
and then touch it (fairly simple)
Incantations (-2): “Where did it go?” (sentence)
Even the most subtle of things can sometimes make all the
difference in the world. Push takes an object of a kilogram or
less in weight and transports it up to 10 minutes forward in
time. The spell is popular with charlatans, con artists, stage
magicians, and pranksters. Once the spell runs its course,
the pushed object appears exactly where it was before the
spell was cast. It is affected by any environmental changes
upon its return.
(((illo s1-3)))

Seize the Day!
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: inanimate forces
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 9 (Fast Reactions (R1), +1D to initiative roll and one
additional free action)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 second (-0)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): A pinch of gunpowder (very common,
destroyed)
Gestures (-2): Swallow gunpowder while looking at target
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-2):”Go!” (phrase, loud)
This spell allows someone of the caster’s choosing to gain an
extra action and a +1D bonus to initiatve for one round. This
boon occurs even if the target has already acted in the given
round. To cast the spell, the mage swallows the gunpowder,
looks at the target, and shouts the incantation.

Sequester
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: dimension, time
Difficulty: 26
Effect: 11 (moves up to 150 kilograms)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 week (+29)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:

Components (-10): A platinum ankh (very rare,
destroyed)
Concentration (-3): 25 seconds with a willpower/mettle
difficulty of 9
Countenance (-2): Skin takes on a bluish shade for the
duration of the spell and the subconscious is haunted
by psychic images
Gestures (-3): Make a circling motion above head with one
hand, then quickly casts the ankh away after pushing
it against her forehead (complex; acrobatics roll with a
difficulty of 11)
Feedback (-4): -4 to damage resistance total
Focused (+8): On caster
Incantations (-2): “Safe from all harm but as close as
a whisper, untouchable now for I am sequestered.”
(sentence)
Variable Duration (+8): On/off switch
Other Alterants (+29): Moves caster out of space and
time
When things look their bleakest, it is good to have an ace
up one’s sleeve. Sequester allows a mage to gain protection by
sliding between the present and future. The successful casting of the spell removes her from the flow of time for up to
one week and deposits her in an alternate dimension where
time stands still. During this period in the alien realm, she
does not age, nor can she perform any actions. Her form is
undetectable by normal means, although a detect resonance
reveals her presence.
When the caster turns off the spell or the spell runs its
course, the mage is returned to the exact spot she started
from when she fled from her current time. The re-emergence
into the normal time stream could be quite perilous for the
temporal traveler, as she must survive any changes to her
current environment.
Some chronomancers fear the time spent in sequester
because their subconscious is tormented with horrible psychic
images as it attempts to adjust to it current state. In rare cases,
those who seek refuge through sequester develop emotional
quirks and in sometimes never fully regain their sanity.

Soulecho
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: death, time
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 9 (Bad Luck (R3))
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 25 minutes (+16)
Casting Time: 10 minutes (-14)
Other Aspects:
Components (-8): 100 grams of bone dust (uncommon,
destroyed)
Gestures (-3): After the incantation is uttered, the bone
dust is used to mark the area of effect. The caster then

spends the rest of the casting time touching the area
of effect and slowly acting as if pulling malevolent
energy from the ground. (complex; acrobatics roll with
a difficulty of 11)
Feedback (-4): -4 to damage resistance total
Focused (+6): On targets
Incantations (-4): “The sins of the past shall surely last.
Sorrow forever surrounds us all. Ne’er let one forget how
the die was cast. Come ye forth, oh misery; heed my call!”
(litany; persuasion roll with difficulty of 15)
Multiple Targets (+24): Up to 8 targets
Although time often heals wounds, it seldom ever forgets
the misery it has been forced to endure in ages past. The pain
of horrible events left buried by the sands of time seethes
and festers as it cries out for vengeance. This volatile, terrible power is the chronomancer’s to wield. Such wizards can
gather the twisted fragments of tortured chronal resonances
and vent the destructive force upon the object of their wrath.
Power such as this is not unleashed lightly, though, and usually done quite covertly. Wise temporal magicians choose to
tread carefully because many people would prefer to forget
the sorrows of the past and leave the undisturbed misery of
ages long gone buried by the dust of the passing years. Those
who disregard the potential danger of daring to manipulate
sorrows of other times run the risk of angering the local
populace. Fools of this nature are not often long lived and
have found themselves burnt at the stake or worse as they
pay the ultimate price for their haughtiness.
The successful casting of a soulecho creates a field of eldritch
energy that feeds upon the pain of the past and forces it
upon the affected area. Those who are unfortunate enough
the pass through the temporal blighted area (upt to eight
victims) attract the Bad Luck (R3) Disadvantage (for the
duration of the spell).
(((illo s1-4)))

Suppress
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: magic, time
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 18 (-4D to physical damage rolls; only affects attack
spells)
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Three dried leaves of any variety (ordinary, destroyed)
Feedback (-2): -2 to damage resistance total
Gestures (-2): Crush the leaves and flick them at the target
(fairly simple)
Other Conditions (-1): Must specify one school to be
affected by casting
This powerful mystic manipulation allows the chronomancer to deftly manipulate the temporal fields around a

given target, much like a skilled surgeon is able to separate
and extract malignant tissue without harming the patient.
When suppress is successfully cast, the victim is moved slightly
out of sync with the normal time stream, which temporarily
weakens the ability to cause harm to others with magic.
When this spell is cast, the wizard chooses a specific school
of magic to affect. For the duration of the spell, any spells
that cause physical damage from the chosen school and cast
by the victim have the damage roll reduced by 4D (with a
minimum total of zero).

Temporal Shackles
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: magic, time
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 23 (damage resistance total of the shackles)
Range: 15 meters (+6)
Speed: Instantaneous (+6)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-8): A 3-centimeter-long piece of quartz
(uncommon, destroyed)
Focused (+6): On target
Gestures (-2): Simulate a whirlpool motion with hands
while uttering the incantation and then appear to toss
the spell toward the target (fairly simple)
Incantations (-2): “A past full of suffering, echoes of futures
bleak, though you vainly strain ’gainst my power, your
will grows weak!” (sentence)
Unreal Effect (-6): Disbelief difficulty of 13
Those who are not familiar with the intricacies of time
can often fall prey to the machinations of those who have
mastered it. Temporal shackles holds a victim fast with bands
of chronal energy that alternate between past and future
waves of power. If a mage’s marksmanship/firearms or apportation total is greater than the target’s combat difficulty, his
quarry is trapped.
The effect’s value plus the result point bonus serve as
the damage resistance total of the shackles. The target can
disbelieve and thus free herself with a Perception/Acumen or
investigation total of 13.

Time Out of Mind
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: magic, time
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 37 (compare to the skill total of the spell countering)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): 2 candles (very common, destroyed)

Concentration (-4): 1 minute with a willpower/mettle difficulty of 10
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Incantations (-3): “Time unyielding, destinies past. Forever onward, the die has been cast. Through fate’s dire
portal, great powers await. Fear thee not, mere mortal:
it is not yet too late!” (complex; persuasion roll with
difficulty of 15)
Gestures (-3): Once the incantation is complete, stretch
arms out over the center of the target, then spread
arms out wide while holding the candles and tracing the
surface of the afflicted. Finally, quickly reach upward
and then make a slashing movement as the arms are
quickly dropped. (complex; acrobatics roll with difficulty
of 11)
Time out of mind allows the mage to reach out mentally
and feel the chronal waves that surround the spell’s intended
beneficiary. Through this temporal gift, the caster can free a
bedeviled soul from a malicious spell or enchantment that
has been cast upon her. If the mage’s efforts are successful,
the subject is released from the harmful magic by temporarily having her chronal essence backwards in time to a point
where it was free of the baneful magic. Once the spells target
is loosed from arcane tribulation and the spell is broken, the
essence rises forward in time and returns to the proper place
in the time stream.

Time Sink
Skill: Chronomancy
Arcane Knowledge: time
Difficulty: 25
Effect: 15 (1 metric ton of material stopped)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+15): Sphere with a radius of 3 meters
Components (-2): A snail shell (ordinary, destroyed)
Gestures (-1): Spreads arms wide in a circle, mimicking
the sphere to be created (simple)
Incantations (-1): “Apart from time!” (phrase)
Other Alterants (+9): Time stopped in area of effect
Sometimes to save the day, one must seize the moment —
literally — and bring everything to a sudden halt. Time sink
was designed just for this purpose. The successful casting this
spell temporarily stops the effects of time in a limited area.
The spell affects both living and nonlinving targets, up to
1,000 kilograms total, including rain, flying projectiles, and
collapsing structures. The caster is also subject to the spell’s
effect if he includes himself in the area of effect.
Additionally, anything entering the area of effect stops
— bullets or shrapnel hitting the edge halt as they enter
the area, people pause as soon as they’re completely inside,
and so on.

Once the duration of the spell wears off, the snail shell fractures and crumbles to dust. When this occurs, all temporally
suspended objects and effects resume their prior course and
motion: Bullets and shrapnel continue toward their intended
targets, people finish their actions, and the like.

Withering Sand
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: death, folk, time
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 6 (Age: Old (R2), +1 to difficulties of physical actions
and +3 to interaction difficulties when attempting to deal
with much younger people)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-6): 60 grams of refined white sand (common, destroyed)
Gestures (-2): Toss sand at intended target and then run
fingers of the same hand across the mage’s scalp from
front to back (fairly simple)
Focused (+4): On target
Incantations (-3): “Youth’s sweet flower soon fades and
grows sour. Life is often lived in vane, for in the end
all must wane. Your essence I draw hither. Before your
sight, watch it wither!” (complex; persuasion roll with
difficulty of 11)
Angered chronomancers are often wicked, vindictive creatures, and one crosses them at his own peril. Withering sand
is but a sample of the serving of pain the temporal titans can
dish out to those who draw their ire. The successful casting
of this spell temporarily afflicts the target with the Age: Old
(R2) Disadvantage. This spell only affects living creatures
and bestows a +1 penalty to the difficulty of physical actions
and +3 to any attempts to interact with those who would
be prejudiced against elderly people. Those who are already
affected by the Age: Old (R2) Disadvantage have all related
modifiers doubled.

The Book of Long Years
The time-tossed, tattered tome that is collectively
known as the Book of Long Years is thought to have
been penned first upon scrolls carved from the backs
of willing sacrifices in ancient Egypt by Ahmut Sadon,
a diabolically brilliant sorcerer. Little is known of the
arcane master save for his orchestrating the month-long
ceremony to prepare his victims; both the wizard and
the newly scribed works disappeared shortly after the
incantations were finished. The mage would never be
heard from again. His work, however, took on a life of
its own. What eventually became the Book of Long Years
would not see the light of day for centuries.

As time passed, Sadon’s work slipped through the
greedy hands of several petty wizards who sought to
exploit his writings to increase their power. Most were
megalomaniacal fools who squandered the chance they
were given. Every so often, though, the sorcerer’s scrolls
wound up in the hands of someone who was perceptive
enough to realize their true potential.
One such mistress of magical might was a Grecian
sage by the name of Helana Orlasis. She spent several
years of her life chasing rumors before finally bartering
for the scrolls near ancient Athens. With her prize in
hand, she fled to self-imposed exile so that she could
decipher them. Unfortunately, before she could profit
from her findings, an assassin’s knife cut her life short.
The scrolls, along with critical portions Helana’s notations, vanished. They were presumed to have been
spirited away by her murderer.
It would take the far-flung legions of a caesar to
unearth the lost knowledge. Agents loyal to their
emperor, brought the efforts of Ahmut and Helana,
to Rome where it was bound and locked away from
prying eyes for years. On occasion, DiCarthi Medecian, a seemingly minor scribe, would steal away from
his appointed tasks and delved into the lost writings.
Though it took the budding chronomancer some long
sessions to decipher the cryptic verse, the effort was
well worth the time. Once he had absorbed the arcane
knowledge, DiCarthi began to rise to his full potential
and soon wielded impressive might. He translated
both the Egyptian and Grecian writings into his native
tongue and later added theories based on what he had
discovered. DiCarthi named the collective work the Book
of Long Years. As with Ahmut, Medecian would vanish
along with his prize. Rome had fulfilled its usefulness,
and destiny called.
As the years passed, the book became much sought
after, and several renowned wizards have claimed to
possess it. Some added spells of their own design, and
the tome’s legend grew. Although many of its owners
met with untimely deaths, the tome survived.
The Book of Long Years resides within battered,
plain, russet, leather covers. Its corners and spine are
adorned with modest brass fittings, and the tome’s sole
decoration is a small silver rune that depicts Ahmut’s
mark. The pages are ichor stained, and their edges are
feathered from ages of wear and abuse.
Contents: Within the pages of the Book of Long Years
lies a wealth of information and the collected works of
Sadon, Althala, Medician, and others who have added
to the legacy. It’s an attractive prize for those who delve
into the chronomantic arts. The original versions of
several chronomancy spells lurk therein also, including
ancestral curse (devolution), folkmoot (earth muse), mind
reel (perceptive flux), subjugate (suppress) and the curse
of Anubis (withering sand).
Protections: The book is not considered to be cursed
or otherwise protected.

Language: Most of the spells are writen in Latin
(even ones added later), but there are also notes in
other languages and some of the original spells from
Helana and Ahumut.
Portions of the book have been copied into lesser
(though nonetheless prices) volumes. Many chronomancers, sages, and collectors would give their eye
teeth for them. The ultimate prize, the legendary
scrolls of Ahumut, appears to have been forever lost
or at the very least hidden as only clever duplicates
have surfaced.
Reading Period/Difficulty: Delving into the pages
of the Book of Long Years is no small endeavor due to the
many transcriptions that the text has gone through. It
typically takes the average reader six months to fully
understand the tome’s contents and a successful Very
Difficult languages/reading/writing roll. One could sift
through its contents and to pick out specific spells by
making a Heroic languages/reading/writing roll and
spending two weeks poring through the tome. Once this
has been completed, individual spells can be learned at
a rate of one spell for every additional month spent in
study and another Very Difficulty languages/reading/
writing roll.

Necromancy
Animate Dead
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Enchanted
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 6 (Skill Bonus: Mindless (R1), +3 to willpower/mettle
totals; Skill Bonus: Painless Wounds (R1), +3 to stamina total;
attributes based on result points)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Complete skeleton or body (uncommon)
Focused (+4): On target
Incantations (-1): “Animate!” (phrase)
Any type of corporeal dead creature can be used for this
ritual. Whether it has been recently killed or dead for years
makes no difference, so long as it is physically intact. Upon
completing the spell, the dead creature is animated but not
living.
The result points of the spell determine the attributes,
Body Points, and Wound levels of the animated dead. The
attributes equal in dice the points above the difficulty. Body
Points equal the result points plus 10. Wound levels equal
the half of the result points (round up). Movement equals
the result points in meters.

Generally rather stupid, the caster can attempt to control
them through simple commands. Left to their own devices,
they attack anything near them.

Animate Superior Undead
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Enchanted
Difficulty: 25
Effect: 33 (+2D to Physique/Strength; +1D to Acumen/Perception; +1D to attribute for brawling/fighting and melee combat;
Skill Bonus: Mindless (R1), +3 to willpower/mettle totals; Skill
Bonus: Painless Wounds (R1), +3 to stamina total; attributes
and movement based on result points)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): Recently dead, complete corpse (very
rare)
Concentration (-5): 15 minutes with willpower/mettle
difficulty of 11
Focus (+11): On target
Gestures (-2): Repeatedly raise hands above target, as if
encouraging it to get up (fairly simple)
Incantations (-3) “Come to life and fight for me, my undead
minion!” (sentence, loud)
The body needed for the ritual must be completely intact,
and dead no longer than 24 hours. After an hour of preparation, the corpse takes on a pseudo-life. The result points of
the spell determine the attributes, Body Points, and Wound
levels of the skeletons. The attributes equal in dice the points
above the difficulty. Body Points equal the result points plus
10. Wound levels equal the half of the result points (round up).
Movement equals the result points in meters. The Physique/
Strength attribute also gets +2D to it, the Acumen/Perception
score goes up by 1D, and brawling/fighting and melee combat
each equal +1D above the related attribute score.
Superior undead have minds of their own. Though they
can understand more than rudimentary commands, this also
means that they are as likely to turn on their creator should
she fail command them properly as they are to continue on
their designated course of action.

Call Tomb Fiend
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: Entity
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 39 (compare to planar distance)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): Dried flesh (common)
Incantations (-3): “Awaken from the immortal shadow!”
(sentence, loud)

Other Conditions (-3): In a tomb or near a burial ground
When summoned, the tomb fiend comes to the aid of the
mage. The creature is not very sizable, and it does not make
an ideal combatant. But, for the purpose of being a servant,
it works wonderfully. Although this stubby and stooped
creature has talons, they are for climbing, not fighting. Furthermore, comprehending the caster’s universe is a difficult
task, making commanding the fiend a challenge.
Commands must be given in simple noun-verb sentences.
The tomb fiend can’t understand anything more complex.

Capture Life force
Skill: Alternation
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 17
Effect: 10 (1 human-sized being held in stasis)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+4)
Duration: 1 month (+32)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Box mad of bone (rare)
Concentration (-2): Must concentrate for 30 minutes
Focused (+8): Bone box
This spell allows a magic user to capture the soul of a living
creature, and lock it away for the spell’s duration. During this
period, the target’s body is not dead; it is in stasis. When cast,
the only visible effect is that the target’s body becomes relaxed
if the spell is successful. At this point, bone box contains the
soul of the person. Time does not pass for those affected by
this spell. Dreams and thought are not possible, life simple
stops and only starts when the spell is ended. The caster can
choose to end the spell early if she chooses.
If the target’s body is destroyed during the spell’s period,
the soul cannot be returned to the living world. Instead,
at the end of the spell, the soul is lost to the neither world.
This spell is not only used to make prisoners of enemies, but
often used to prolong the life of a dying friend. If it is cast
before death, the body can be carried to someone capable
of healing the character. However, the lifeforce must be
returned to the body before it can be healed. Other uses for
this spell are to prevent aging during travel, or the exhaustion of traveling — allowing someone else to carry the bone
box and transporting the body in a casket.

Cold Flesh

Conqueror Worm

Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 18 (+4D to disguise [con: disguise in D6 Space] against
undead or machines)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): iron filings (uncommon)
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-1): Sprinkle filings on target (simple)
This spell disguises a living being from detection by the nonliving by masking the target’s body ambient temperature.
Undead creatures or heat sensing device cannot sense the
target. The effects of this spell last until either the duration
expires or the target attacks or threatens any non-living
entity or machine that is being deceived. If the player character is trained in disguise, then the modifier from the spell
is added to the skill.

Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 30
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 3 weeks (+31)
Casting Time: 2 days (-27)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): Earthworm (common)
Focused (+12): On target
Incantations (-3): Repeated incantations of un-life; an
willpower/mettle roll with a difficulty 11 must be made
during each day of casting (complex)
Other Condition (-2): After the spell is cast, the magic user
must find a way to get a victim to swallow the foul creation.
Often the worm can be hidden in food or drink — alcohol
cannot kill it. If it is not consumed within 24 hours after the
spell’s casting, the worm dies and is useless. An Acumen or
Perception roll with a 10 difficulty must be performed by the
intended victim to detect the presence of the worm.
This spell prepares the component for the spell Monstrous
Creation By transforming the positive living energy of a
simple earthworm, the magic user creates an evil seed that is
usually unwittingly consumed by an intended victim. Often,
the victim is one of the caster’s own henchmen, as once the
worm is ingested, it becomes a parasite, waiting for the proper
magic to transform it a fell creature that devours its host. By
using a henchman, the spell is ready to be activated at will.
Certainly there is a cost in acolytes and followers, but those
can easily be replaced.

Consuming Sphere
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 30
Effect: 30 (6D+2, ignores nonmagical armor)
Range: 15 meters (+6)
Speed: Instantaneous (+6)
Duration: 3 rounds (+6)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+15): 3-meter sphere
Feedback (-2): -2 to damage resistance total
Gestures (-1): Rolling motion with hands (simple)
Incantations (-2): “Consume them!” (sentence)
Variable Movement (+3): Movement of 12.5 meters per
round
This spell produces a 3-meter sphere of pulsating dark energy
that rolls across the ground, doing damage to all living matter
it encounters. The trajectory of the sphere cannot be changed
once the spell is cast. However, as it is not instantaneous,
there is a possibility potential targets can avoid encountering
this deadly conjuration, providing it is seen. During daylight
hours, a search of Easy is required; during night, or in darkness, a search of Very Difficult is required. Also, avoidance
requires that the character has time to dive clear.
The sphere consumes life energy. This means that nonmagical armor offers no protection against it. None of this energy
increases the damage of the sphere, nor is it conveyed to the
magic user. Victims who die as a result, quickly whither, leaving only bones and dust behind. Non-living material such as
armor weapons and so on are not affected.

Corpse Fog *
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Air
Difficulty:32
Effect: 27 (+D6 to hide)
Range: 60 meters (+9)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)0 (+9)
Duration: 2 minutes (+10)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+20): 10-meter radius
Components (-4): Earth from a graveyard (rare)
Gestures (-2): Fanning of hands (simple)
Variable Movement (+1): Movement of 5 meters per
round
Other Conditions: (-4) While this spell does not require
the caster to be standing in a graveyard, it must be a location
where the living have fallen and are now beneath the surface.
Such areas can be ancient cities, battlefields, potters fields,
disaster sites, etc.
When commencing this spell, the caster must toss the earth
from a graveyard into the air, followed by the prescribed
hand motions. For this spell to work properly, the caster

must be on ground where dead are buried. It is the decaying
foulness of the dead that the caster pulls from the earth
to obscure the surrounding area, creating a dense fog that
hangs in the air.

Dead Man’s Gaze
Cantrip
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 3
Effect: 4 (5 seconds)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): 2 copper coins (very common)
Gestures (-1): Place coins on eyes of the deceased (simple)
Incantations (-2): “What do I see with your eyes?” (sentence)
If the last moments of a dead man’s life are frozen on his
retinas, then this spell can reveal them. Once the coins are in
place and the spell successfully completed,the caster can try
to gain information. First the coins are removed, and then
the deceased’s eyes gazed upon. The gamemaster determines
the result points needed from casting the spell, basing it
upon how traumatic the final moments were. For example,
if a character was brutally murdered, then it could require
up to four points to see the killer’s face, but probably nine
to 12to discern background details. The reason for this is
due to the fact that the victim likely spent his last moments
of existence fixed upon the murder’s countenance. The spell
reveals nothing other than the last few seconds of life.

Dead Sight *
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 6 (search skill of 2D)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 5 minutes (+12)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): 2 eyes of a recently killed creature — of
the type the spells is targeted on (very rare)
Concentration (-2): Others can be present when the caster
is viewing with this spell, but there is a chance that
interacting with the caster will cause a failure; willpower/
mettle roll at 8 once for each interaction to disrupt is
required — use.
Focused (+3): On target
Incantations (-2): “And the dead shall see.” (sentence)
The caster gains the sight of the undead target. While the
target’s movement cannot be controlled without another
magic, the eyes of the target become the eyes of the caster,

replacing the all-normal vision until the spell is ended or
disrupted. During the spells operation, the caster relies upon
the 2D search of the undead target, and dark and alien world.
Untested casters must take a mettle test the first few times
this spell is used. Once practiced enough, the morbid nature
of the “dead vision” no longer disturbs the viewer. How many
times this takes is dependent upon the nature of what is
being seen, and left to the gamemaster’s discretion. Until the
caster has become accustomed to this level of morbidity, a
willpower/mettle roll should be made after a successful casting
of the spell. Failure results in the immediately halting the
magic, and a visibly shaken mage for several minutes. The
spell can be ended at any time.

Deadspeak
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 28
Effect: 48 (4D languages/speaking, 4D intimidation, 4D
investigation)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 24 hours (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-8): Dried flesh, writing device, human blood
(uncommon)
Focused (+13): On target
Gestures (-2): Write incantation upon the dried flesh
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): Arcane phrase (phrase)
Other Conditions (-2): Requires a dead body that at least
has the skull intact — flesh is not required.
Once the components of this spell have been used, they are
useless for future casting of the spell. New materials must
be acquired. But casting this spell grants many benefits. The
dead have much to say, particularly those who have been
recently murdered. As in life, there is an art to interrogating the unliving; sometimes guile must be used, other times
force is required. The approach needed is determined by the
gamemaster and the situation. The target of the spell gains
4D in the language of the dead, as well as the skill necessary
to investigate and intimidate an pulse-less subject. All difficulty
levels, whether they are opposed rolls or predetermined are
set by the gamemaster.

Dead Things
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 25
Effect: 23 (5D)
Range: 5 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 1minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:

Components (-4): various body parts and extremities
(very rare)
Feedback (-2): -2 to damage resistance total
Focused (+6): On each extremity
Incantations (-2): “Live! I give you life!” (sentence)
Multi-Target (+3): 1 extremity (cumulative +3 to the Difficulty Number for each additional extremity)
The mage can give life to various severed extremities in a
10 meter radius by sacrificing a part of her life energy. Once
cast, any once living extremity in the area of effect comes
to life, crawling, wiggling, scampering or rolling toward any
living enemy the caster indicates. Typically this spell is used
upon hands, legs, fingers, heads, anything that can cause
damage. The amount of damage from a claw, bite or scratch
is determined by the number of points assigned to it.
To determine how man dead things come to life, the caster
assigns up to a total of 5D points to each by rolling. 1 point
is required for an extremity to move and attack. Likewise, it
can suffer only 1 point of damage before being destroyed. This
means if the caster rolls 12, then 2 points can be assigned
to all potential targets within the spell’s area of effect. In
this case, 6 various body parts begin to move and engage in
combat. The points can be divided unequally. Regardless of
how high the dice rolls, an entire body cannot be animated
— only extremities. The dead things can be merely bone or
have flesh and muscle, it makes no difference. It is the life
energy of the caster that gives them life.

Death’s Hand
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 17
Effect: 30 (10D damage)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): skeletal hand (rare)
Focused (+6): On Target
Gestures (-1): point skeletal hand at target (simple)
Incantations (-2): “Grasp the heart of my enemy.” (sentence)
This spell is of the darkest arts, calling upon the evil powers
to consume the vital energy of a target’s heart, halting its
beating, bringing death. The proper component is needed for
the type of a target. To use this spell on a human requires a
skeletal human hand; to target a specific monster requires
the hand (or claw) of the type of targeted monster.

Drain Essence
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Enchanted
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 9 (-2D from Physique attribute)
Range: 3 meters (+4)

Speed: Instantaneous (+3 (+4)
Duration: 5 rounds (+6)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+3): On target
Gestures (-1): Point (simple)
Incantations (-1): “Wither.” (phrase)
When the caster utters the incantation, dark arcs of energy
flash around the target, reducing Physique by -2D. Normal
armor doesn’t protect against this spell, as the target’s essence
is pulled from the body through the material. Magical protection does hinder the spell, reducing damage as normal. The
victim remains in this state for the duration of this spell,
and the caster does not gain the extracted energy. After the
spell is disrupted or ends, the target’s Physique returns to
normal.

Duncan’s Malicious Contagion
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 32
Effect: 45 (10D disease)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 1 year (+38)
Casting Time: 1 month (-32)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): rotting rodent or other vermin (common)
Focused (+16): On Target
Gestures (-1): Prick thumb with despoiled vermin blood
(simple)
Incantations (-2): “By the pricking of my thumb, a malicious contagion this way comes.” (sentence)
Other Alternants (+3): While the caster is immune to the
contagion she has created, she is a vector. All who come in
contact must roll Physique at Easy, otherwise they become
infected with the illness.
Few know this diabolical spell, as those who have learned of
its existence either promptly destroyed, or used it and were
discovered and in turn were killed by a rampaging populous
sick with a magical plague. The gamemaster should make
learning or finding this spell very difficult and the ramifications well known to the caster. It is reasoned that the spell
was developed in time of war, a weapon of siege. Others
ventured that the spell served the revenge of its namesake.
The truth may never be known. Nonetheless, its effects can
be devastating.
Once successfully cast, the mage is immune to the contagion. Still, she is free to roam around a populated area, and
all who come into physical contact must make a Physique roll
of Easy. Failure means the person suffers 1D bleeding sores
within 24 hours. Each day these sores spread, increasing by
another +1D, eventually covering the entire body in suppurating wounds to a maximum of 10D wounds; if a character
survives this, then she has survived the sickness. Likewise,
any person who comes into contact with this infected person

must make a Physique/Strength roll at Easy, otherwise suffer the same fate. Attempts to use medicine/healing produce
contact. If the infected are not promptly segregated, then all
who around them run the risk of contracting the contagion.
This magical malady can only be conveyed by living beings,
human or animal. After 1 year from the day of the casting,
the spell halts, regardless of the number of ill. The disease
stops spreading and promptly heats at a normal rate, vanishing almost as quickly as it appeared.

Enthrall Undead
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Enchanted
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 26 (charm undead skill bonus at +5D+2)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Raw flesh (rare)
Focused (+8): On target
Gestures (-2): Snap fingers while tossing the component
on the ground before the target (fairly simple)
Unreal Effect (-6): Disbelief difficulty of 13
Often it is simpler for a magic user practiced in Necromancy
to befriend undead, rather than destroy them. This spell
permits one or more undead to be enthralled, falling under
the control of the caster. During this period, the targets
follow all instructions given — they naturally understand
the character who cast the spell. Mindless creatures such as
skeletons and zombies can be ordered to destroy themselves
or each other. But undead with limited cognitive capabilities
such as mummies and vampires are allowed a Very Difficult
willpower/mettle roll. A failure results in unquestioning obedience. A success causes them to ignore the command.

Fleshy Armor
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 14 (4D+2 armor)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1(+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): The flesh of a dead creature (very
rare)
Concentration (-2): Because of the power of the incantation used, the caster must be alone and uninterrupted
for the duration of the casting. No living being, other
than the caster, can be within 5 meters.
Incantations (-2): A phrase that animates dead flesh, known
only to those who study Death (sentence)
Focused (+7): On self

No armor can be worn for this spell to function properly.
As the casting commences, the dead flesh appears to meld
together, and crawl across the caster’s body, becoming a second layer of skin. As this flesh is dead, it provides protection
from physical attacks. When the spell reaches the end of its
duration, the dead flesh becomes rank. By the last 30 minutes
of the spell, the dead flesh is putrid, suppurating nauseating
fluid. This atrocious odor acts as a warning for the wearer,
allowing her to know the spell is about to end. It also hinders
the protected person’s sense of smell (-1D Perception).

Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-7): Claws of a ghoul (extremely rare)
Focused (+6): On Target
Incantations (-2): “Ghoul’s touch” (sentence)
A successful casting of this spell imbues the mage with the
Advantage Paralyzing Touch (4) as described in the “Character
Options” chapter. Before the victim of an attack can become
paralyzed, the mage must make find an unprotected location
that reveals flesh. The gamemaster might require a Perception
or a search roll at an appropriate difficulty to find such a spot
if one is readily evident.

Tome Title: Immortal Phenomena
Description/History: This treatise on Necromancy is a lofty
800 handwritten pages, bound in what appears to be human
skin (a Perception roll of 15 is required to determine this, or
a medicine/healing roll of 5). There is only one such book in
existence, and it is highly coveted by those whom practice the
necromantic arts. Likewise, it is despised by many others from
various schools of magic deemed to reveal too much of the
hidden workings of Death This is apparent from the tattered
and burned edges. Many times has this grimoire been pulled
from a heap of burning books. The only inscription within
the book indicating the author is found in the title.
Contents: Besides containing a list of spells, the book has
many expositions and essays upon the black arts. After careful
study, the reader can improve her knowledge of Necromancy
by 1D. The spells included are: Animate Dead, Animate Superior Dead, Call Tomb Fiend, Corpse Fog, Death’s Hand, Drain
Essence, Fleshy Armor, Unliving Weapon.
Protections : none

Language: The tome is written in a common language of the
gamemaster’s choosing. However, it does require the reader
be skilled in magic, and a successful Magic roll of Difficult
to decipher the script, symbols and arcane terminology.
Without prolonged study, such a success allows the reader
to understand the nature of the text.
Reading Period: 6 months to read and comprehend. Each
month a Magic roll of Difficult is required. Only after 6 successful months or reader has the contents been fully comprehended. At this time, Magic can be increased by +1D or 3
pips can be divided across alteration and conjuration.

Gestures (-2): Turn a complete circle with tooth extended
in hand (fairly simple)
This ritual prohibits entry of undead within the Area Effect
prescribed. They may amble about, circling the protected
ground, but they are unable to pass across the faint white
barrier the magic user erects. While all those within the spell’s
zone of safety can cast spells and fire missiles at any nearby
undead without voiding the spells, non-living creatures
outside the area are unable to do the same.

Ghost Passage

Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Entity
Difficulty: 33
Effect: 36
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+100 (+10)
Duration: 3 rounds (+15)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Victim who has consumed a Conqueror
Worm (rare)
Focused (+10): On target
Gestures (-1): Point at target (simple)
Incantations (-2): “There is something dangerous in you,
that wisdom should fear!” (sentence)
Other Conditions: (-5) This spell requires that the target
consume a worm transformed by the spell Conqueror Worm.
Only if this preparation has been performed, then is it possible for the spell to function properly. (elaborate)
With the gesture and the utterance of the commanding phrase,
the Conqueror Worm begins to consume its host at an alarming rate. In 3 rounds, a human size body can be consumed
and transformed into a wretched creature that resembles
the host only in gross form. As this process kills the host,
it is a painful process, usually resulting in the writhing and
screaming of the victim. If the character is killed before the
transformation is complete, the spell is halted.
If the process is completed, then the abomination that
exists is a fleshless, clawed creature (+2D+1 damage) that
follows the magic user’s every command. Its basic attributes
are identical to those of its host, but it can only use its claws to
attack — it is mindless. However, its Body Points are replaced
with a roll of 6D (or it starts with no wounds). Once the foul
monstrosity dies, it cannot be brought back to life without
repeated the entire process. As a result, magic users often
have a few Conqueror Worms nestled inside companions,
just for emergencies.

Skill: Apportation

Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused: On target (+5)
Gestures (-1): Touch target upon forehead (simple)
Unreal Effect (-3): Disbelief difficulty of 13
After this spell is invoked, the target becomes ethereal, as does
her belongings. This allows her to move without a sound, at
normal movement. However, the movement is otherworldly
in that she appears to glide. Those who do not know she is
under the effect of a spell are likely to mistake her for a ghost
or spirit. Such characters need to make a Charisma/Presence
roll, or a willpower/mettle roll with a Difficulty of 13. The
unfortunates who mistake the target as an unearthly entity
flee until they no longer see the apparent apparition.
Additionally, this spell allows a hero to pass through physical
barriers up to 0.5 meters thick. For the duration of the spell,
the target is unable to talk or physically interact with the
environment, as she no longer possesses a corporeal from.
This limitation extends to hearing, as well. Unless the recipient of the spell is contacted through magical, telepathic or
supernatural means, the only form of communication allows
is through gestures.

Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (+2)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Crushed pearl and bone dust (rare)
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Focused (+3): On target
Gestures (-1): Point at target (simple)
A sudden burst of white energy streaks from the caster’s finger
toward the undead target, resulting is a brilliant flash of light.
Upon contact the ball of energy radiates outward, extending
toward the earth and any other nearby objects, discharging
the negative energy that maintains the un-life of the living
dead target. All undead, not demons or other types of extradimensional creatures, suffer 6D damage from the attack. As
casting this spell requires the magic user to use her own life
force, she receives a -3 to her damage resistance total.

Necromantic Sigil
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 13
Effect: 23 (+5D to alteration skill)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 5 minutes (+10)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-7): 1 round of meditation; willpower/
mettle roll at 13
Focused (+6): On target
Gestures (-1): Mark necromantic sigil in air before target
(simple)
Incantations (-2): “Be protected from the magic of Death.”
(sentence)
Any target bearing this necromantic sigil is protected
against all magic of necromancy. Unlike countermagic or a
Ward, this spell is in operation once successfully cast and
has a duration. From that point, any other Necromancy spells
must have a skill total equal to or greater than the target’s
roll with the bonus modifier gained from this spell. If the
attacking spell total is lower, then it is negated. This defense
continues until the duration of the spell is satisfied.

Necrosis
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 9 (3D)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 24 hours (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+5): On target
Incantations (-1): “Death” (phrase)
With a simple touch, the caster can cause 3D damage to a
target. The target’s passive defense is used if the attack is

unsuspected. If it is anticipated, normal combat rules are
used.
By becoming a pathway for negative life energy, the magic
user is able to send negative life energy into the victim. The
touched area first becomes pale, as though drained of blood,
then it turns blue, eventually becoming black as though
gangrenous. The effect isn’t permanent; it heals naturally.
Additionally, the caster gains no bonuses from using the
spell. It is an offensive magic known by many who study the
school of Necromancy.

Passing of Years
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 42
Effect: 114 (Age 3 years)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1.5 seconds (+1)
Casting Time: 3 rounds (-6)
Other Aspects:
Components (-14): 1 gram of dust from the remains of a living being that has decayed naturally (extremely rare)
Concentration (-3): Requires 2 rounds of concentration;
willpower/mettle roll of 9.
Gestures (-3): Sifting the dust between fingers (complex)
Incantations (-7) Repeated litany of archaic language
learned with the spell; requires artist difficulty 19.
Loudly (sentence)
Other Conditions: (-1): Only works on living targets
When casting this wretched spell, the mage is able to drain
away the life of a target. The spell requires the caster to obtain
the naturally decayed remains of a once living creature. Then,
while uttering the incantation, 1 gram of dust is ground
between the fingers, letting it fall freely. As this happens, a
black sphere is formed before the mage. This process takes 2
rounds. On the third round, the sphere can be grasped by the
one who cast the spell, and thrown at the target. A successful
marksmanship/firearms or apportation roll is required. If successful, then 3 years of life is drained from the victim’s body.
The living energy is not transferred to the mage, it is merely
siphoned away, aging the hapless enemy of the caster. With
each casting the dust that forms the deadly black sphere is
consumed in the process.

Plague Wind
Skill: Conjuration*
Arcane Knowledge: Air
Difficulty: 38
Effect: 9 (3D in damage from inhaling)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+100 meters (+10)
Duration: 3 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-6)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+50): 10-meter sphere

Components (-4): Ash from a human corpse (rare)
Gestures (-2): Blow ash from hand (complex)
Incantations (-2): “Let dire winds blow.” (sentence)
Variable Movement (+1): Movement of 5 meters per
round
A skilled caster can send this poisonous breeze directly toward
an enemy. For those who are not otherwise engaged, it is
possible to see a gray pall of dust moving in the direction
the caster desires. If seen, and far enough away, an attempt
to dodge the dangerous pall can be made. All who inhale its
fetid air suffer 3D damage.

Possess the Unliving
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death, enchanted
Difficulty: 30
Effect: 30 (Possession: Full (R1))
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Components (-6): Personal possession or a part of the body
of target (uncommon); charcoal (very common)
Focused (+11): Mage’s mind stays with target
Gestures (-3): Draw circles and sigils of possession (complex; artist roll with difficulty of 11)
Incantations (-2): “Enter the husk and become its mind.”
(sentence)
Other Conditions (-1): Target must be unburied
By casting this spell, the mage can possess an unliving
corpse. She retains her mental attributes, but she takes on
the physical attributes of that the corpse formerly possessed
(possibly reduced, depending on the freshness of the corpse).
As there is no mind, she gains no knowledge about the corpse,
though she’s in complete control of the body.
Of course there is always a risk if a mage animates an
corpse. Any who see such a thing naturally mistake it for a
zombie and are likely to attack.

Preternaturality
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Enchanted
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 36 (+8D to various non-Extranormal attributes)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1(+ 0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Fresh blood from a sacrifice (rare)
Focused (+9): On Target
Gestures (-3): Mark each part of the body to be enhanced
with blood (complex)
Incantations (-2): “Be anointed with the life’s energy of
another.” (sentence)

By using the fresh blood of a similar sacrifice, the target
gains a bonus to each attribute the caster chooses. The
caster must rub the blood on the part of the body to gain
the attribute increase. No single attribute can be increased
by more than +3D.

Putrescence
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 13
Effect: 12 (4D)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): venom from a poisonous creature
(rare)
Feedback (-1): -1 to damage resistance total
Focused (+6): On target
Incantations (-2): “Imbue with the foulness of Death”
(sentence)
In an instant this spell can transforms liquids or consumable solids of any sort into poison that causes 4D damage
each round for the duration of the spell if the victim is not
treated by natural or magical means. The damage commences
immediately after ingesting the altered item. A Difficult
stamina roll is required to naturally overcome the effect. All
that needs to be done is for the caster to touch the drink or
food for it to be tainted. A Perception roll of Very Difficult is
required to detect the toxin through smell or taste.

Regeneration
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 17
Effect: 18 (medicine/healing of 6D)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Fresh blood from the specific creature
on which the spell is to be cast (uncommon)
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-3): Mark sigil on forehead with blood (comoplex;
artist roll with difficulty of 11)
A mage can fend off the approaching death of a hero by successfully casting this spell. But with healing comes pain. In
order for the spell to work, fresh blood must be drawn from
the intended target. This requires a medicine/healing roll at
Moderate difficulty. This also causes 1D damage if the roll
was a success. A failure results in 2D damage. A 1 on the Wild
Die can produce catastrophic bleeding if the gamemaster
desires — meddling in dark magics has a price.
Once the blood is extracted and the spell is successfully cast,
then the target regenerates damage automatically at a with a

6D medicine/healing skill level. This requires no action on the
characters part. It occurs once every minute for the duration
of the spell. And its effects are visible noticeable to those take
the time to look for them. Another telltale sign is the bloodly
sigil that must remain in place on the target’s forehead. As
it is magical in nature, sweat or splashed water or rain will
not remove it. However, it can be rubbed away if the target
does so intentionally. Doing this ends the spell.

Sanguineous Attack
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 25 (+3D+1 damage, 3D+1 intimidation)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 3 rounds (+6)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Drop of blood (ordinary)
Focused (+4): On weapon
Gestures (-2): Flick drop of blood toward living target
(fairly simple)
By simply pricking her thumb, the caster can cause any
weapon to gain +3D+1 damage. Such items can be swords,
knifes, bullets, clubs, anything physical that makes physical
contact with a living creature. If the spell is cast on an item that
successfully causes damage to a target, the effect manifests
itself as unusually heavy bleeding. Excessive bleeding can be
alarming, often causing panic. Characters suffering a wound
from this spell must also suffer a 3D+1 intimidation roll.

Sense Death
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 14 (3D Perception of Would Level)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10 (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Bloodied cloth (ordinary)
Focused (+4): On target
Gestures (-1): Close eyes (simple)
Other Condition (-1): Must make a search roll to see the
target; all normal modifiers apply.
Casting this spell attunes the magic use with the life force of
the target, providing 3D Perception roll to determine a target’s
Wound Level. There are no other effects imbued, other than
determining the amount of life remaining in a character.

Sense Spirit
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Entity
Difficulty: 24

Effect: 24 (8D search when attempting to locate spirits or
ghosts)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0) (+0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+20): 10 meters radius
Focused (+6): On caster
Incantations (-2): Reveal yourself (sentence)
Once this spell is cast, the mage can see all undead spirits
and ghosts within a 10-meter radius. Likewise, the attention of any such incorporeal being is drawn to the character
who uttered the incantation, as the spell forces the entities
to reveal themselves to the caster, and only the caster. The
search roll is needed as the spirits are being commanded to
reveal themselves.

Unliving Weapon
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Enchanted
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 11 (+2D+1)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+1 (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): Weapon of good quality (common)
Feedback (-1): -1 to damage resistance total
Focused (+5): On weapon
Gestures (-2): Run fingers across weapon (simple)
A weapon upon which this spell is cast is imbued with a negative field of energy. A deep red hue radiates from the weapon
so long as the spell endures. All attacks against living beings
gain a +2D+1 bonus to the weapon’s normal damage. With
each successful strike, the aura radiating from the weapon
spreads across the opponent’s form as life force is drained
away. No additional damage is conveyed when combating
undead entities.

Wake the Dead
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 27
Effect: 30 (10D Body Points)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+100 (+10)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+20): 10-meter radius
Components (-4): Skull (uncommon)
Concentration (-10): 1 round of focused thought upon the
dead; willpower/mettle roll at 16
Gestures (-1): Lifting hand upward (simple)

Incantations (-2): “Awaken and walk!” loudly (sentence)
Other Condition (-3): The spell can only be cast in an area
where dead exist beneath the earth, such as a graveyard,
battlefield, or some other such place.
By calling upon the arcane knowledge of Death and Necromancy, the mage is able to wake the dead in a 10-meter radius
within 100 meters. Bones form into skeletons, and recently
buried corpse become zombies. The total number of dead is
determined by the rolling of the 10D Body Points dice. Each
creature is awarded 1 Wound Level or 6 Body Points This means
if a total of 24 was roll on the dice, then only 4 undead are
called from the earth. The number is rounded down, making
the maximum always 6 undead. This spell only brings forth
skeletons and zombies, no other type of undead creatures.
They are likely to have the attributes of the average living
creature for the location, as well as possess any clothing or
weapons that might normally be buried with them.
Even though the mage is the one who has summoned
the dead from their repose, there is no kinship felt toward
her. Rather, all undead called from their graves attack any
living creature within the 10-meter radius the spell’s effect,
including the mage and any associates. Returning from death
is unpleasant and instills hatred and jealous of the living.
These awakened creatures show no mercy when disposing
of those who live.

Withering Blast
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 18 (3D6 damage)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10 (+5)
Duration: 3.5 seconds (+3)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-1): Makes a thrusting motion with hand
(simple)
Incantations (-1): “Devour!” loudly (phrase)
By calling upon negative energy of life, the mage is able
to hurl a blast of withering power that consumes the life
of a target. During the round the spell is cast, a successful
marksmanship/firearms or apportation roll is required to hit
the target. Nonmagical armor offers no protection from this
death magic. Any character Mortally Wounded by the spell
loses ages 1 year from the effect. This stolen year, or any
number of years taken by this spell, can only be returned
by magical means.

Sominomancy
Cleansing Sleep
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Death, folk
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 27 (medicine/healing of 9D)

Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 10 hours (+23)
Casting Time: 25 minutes (-16)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Large amount of water (ordinary)
Gestures (-2): Washing with and drinking water (fairly
simple)
Other Conditions (-11): Effect may be used once per
hour; spell is broken if caster is awakened during the
duration
The mage casts this spell, spending 25 minutes washing
herself thoroughly with water and drinking plenty of fluids,
then she goes to sleep. While she sleeps, her body rids itself
of toxins and diseases. This spell courses through her veins
and organs, destroying harmful bacteria, viruses, and natural
and synthetic toxins, rendering her healthy and fit once again.
Each hour, the caster can attempt to eliminate a single poison
or illness within her body by making a medicine/healing roll
as if she had 9D in the skill. The gamemaster determines the
difficulty to eliminate a specific poison or disease; 15 to 20
is generally a good range.
The caster may apply her result point bonus to the first
medicine/healing roll she makes with this spell.

Concentration Lapse
Cantrip (Advanced)
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 8
Effect: 5 (difficult to attack target is at -5)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 second (0)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-1): Waves hand in a hypnotic pattern (simple)
The mage waves her hand in a sinuous motion or wiggles
her fingers slowly. The target must make a willpower/mettle
roll with a difficulty of 10. If he fails, his eyelids droop briefly,
and he experiences a momentary lapse of concentration,
of the sort he might have if he were very tired. This lapse
makes him fumble his defenses: He is too slow on the parry
or notices the incoming punch half a second too late; the
difficulty to hit him is decreased by until the caster’s turn
in the next round.
The caster may apply her result point bonus to the difficulty
of the target’s willpower/mettle roll to avoid the effect.

Detect Slumber
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 5 (value to determine state of slumber)
Range: Self (+0)

Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 second (0)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect: (+15): Divination sphere sphere with radius
of 10 meters
Other Conditions (-1): Only works on sleeping creatures
The caster’s vision takes on an added quality, providing her
with additional information about certain creatures within
the area of effect. Simply by looking at a creature within
the area of effect, she instantly knows whether or not it is
asleep. If it is not asleep, the caster has no additional means
of discerning if it is resting, about to fall asleep, feigning
sleep, dead, or in any other state; this spell simply reveals
that the creature is sleeping or that it is not. Generally, the
caster can determine the sleeping condition of all the creatures within the area of effect unless they are hidden from
view or there are a great many of them (and thus some are
concealing others).

Dream Travel
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 11 (moves up to 150 kilograms)
Range: 1 kilometer (+15)
Speed: Instantaneous (+15)
Duration: 40 seconds (+8)
Casting Time: 25 seconds (-7)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-3): 25 seconds with willpower/mettle
difficulty of 9
Other Conditions (-2): Pass only between dreamers
The caster uses this spell to transport herself great distances
via the dreams of other creatures. She moves from dream to
dream in the time it takes to blink, seeing strange landscapes
and briefly passing by the hopes and fears of myriad creatures
before arriving at her destination.
When she casts this spell, the caster targets a sleeping
creature within one kilometer; she must see or otherwise
be aware of the sleeper’s location (perhaps by sleep sense, for
instance) and it must be the size of a cat or larger. Over the
course of 30 seconds, her physical form fades into translucence
and disappears entirely as she enters the sleeping creature’s
dreams. During these 30 seconds, the caster cannot influence
events around her, nor can she move from her position; her
mind and body are becoming part of the creature’s dreams.
Though she enters the sleeping creature’s dreams, the
dreamer does not detect her and she cannot deliver messages or otherwise influence his dreams, as she could with
step into sleep; she is merely along for the ride, using the
creature’s sleeping consciousness as a vehicle for her unique
brand of magic.
Once at the new host, the caster’s physical form slowly
manifests, fading into translucence and then becoming solid
in the latest dreamer’s presence. As she was when she first

entered the dreams, she is not physically present in the area
until her form solidifies over the course of 30 seconds.
Note that the caster has no knowledge of the surroundings
of her destination dreamer, and she could appear in the midst
of enemies or in an inhospitable environment — though
as people do not usually sleep in these sorts of conditions,
the odds are slim. The caster usually ends up in a bedroom
somewhere and tiptoes out.
Note that though the process of the caster’s physical self
discorporating takes time, the dream travel itself is virtually
instantaneous.

Dream Visions
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 22
Effect: 12 (search of 4D)
Range: 2.5 kilometers (+17)
Speed: Instantaneous (+17)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 5 hours (-22)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+12): Divination sphere with radius of 5
meters
Components (-4): Photographs or paintings of exotic
locales (uncommon)
Concentration (-6): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 12
This spell allows the caster to view distant places in her
dreams, though those places are not exactly as they appear
in the real world.
The caster spends one hour in preparation, gazing at the
photographs or paintings and envisioning the place she
would like to see (which does not have to be the place of
the paintings). Then, she goes to sleep. Four hours into her
sleep (which are part of the casting time), her dreams take
on more meaningful forms. She can observe any one area
within 2.5 kilometers as if she were there herself, using a
search skill of 4D. She can view an area with which she is
familiar or she can specify a direction and distance, such
as “southwest, 1.22 kilometers,” and view the area at that
distance. If the specified location is within the ground, a
wall, or other obstruction, she sees nothing but darkness.
Her point of view can appear close to the ground, viewing
it as she would if she were standing there, or it can appear
floating in the air, at ground level, and so on.
The caster does not see the areas exactly as normal, for
she is within the dreamscape. Areas and people within the
dreamscape appear as they do in the real world, but the
lighting is indistinct and gray mists hover at the edges of
vision. Forms are muted and blurred. Most importantly, the
subconscious images that people associate with individuals,
places, and things walk the dreamscape. Though these images
may have no physical existence in the real world, they are the
things people dream about when they visit these areas and
creatures in their sleep. For example, a graveyard dreamscape

may be haunted by ghosts and the cries of the dead, because
these fears lurk in humanity’s subconscious and when people
dream of graveyards, these images often appear. A sports star
in the dreamscape may have trophies, women, and dollar bills
floating around him, as these are the ideas that other people
associate with such a celebrity.
The ancillary images in the dreamscape can serve both
to enhance and obscure the caster’s understanding and are
tools for the gamemaster to use.

Dreams in Hand
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 0 (creates 1 kilogram of inanimate material)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 40 minutes (+17)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Component (-1): A few grains of sand (ordinary)
Concentration (-6): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 12
Focused (+3): On sand
Other Alterant (+25): Item can be of any complexity or
value, but the greater the complexity or value, the greater
the secondary skill roll required
This spell allows the caster to enter her dreams, envision
an item, and return to the waking world with that item in
her possession.
For one hour, the caster meditates on the spell and the
item she wishes to create with her dreams. She can imagine
anything she likes, though complicated or artistic objects
require skill rolls as determined by the gamemaster. (Failure
on the secondary skill roll indicates that some obvious flaw
exists in the item; success has no effect beyond the item’s
satisfactory creation.)
Aftershe awakes from the meditation, the object is in
her hand, a physical reality. It remains substantial for 40
minutes; after this time, it grows translucent before it disappears entirely.
The caster can use this spell to create items of great intrinsic
worth, like currency, precious metals, or jewelry, but they
vanish when the duration expires, which is bound to anger
shopkeepers.
The caster can add her result point bonus to the spell’s
duration value and refigure the measure in seconds.

Dreamtime
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 43
Effect: 50 (up to 1 year in the past or future — specified at
spell casting; search of 4D)
Range: 20 kilometers (+19)
Speed: Instantaneous (+19)
Duration: 25 minutes (+16)

Casting Time: 5 hours (-22)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+12): Divination sphere with radius of 5
meters
Components (-4): A 4-hour hourglass (uncommon)
Concentration (-6): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 12
Other Alterant (+2): May select time period viewed
This spell allows the caster to use her dreams to view places
as they appeared in the past or will appear in the future.
The caster spends one hour in preparation, meditating and
focusing, at the end of which she turns the hourglass and
goes to sleep. Four hours later (which are part of the casting
time), as the sand in the hourglass trickles out, the caster’s
dreams take on meaning.
In addition to the ability to view a distant location (up to
20 kilometers away), the caster can also look up to a year
into the past or the future. She makes the decision as to the
area and the time when she casts the spell. (For example,
“The playground at Washington Heights Elementary School,
January 2, 3:31 p.m.”)
If the caster looks into the past, she sees the area as it
appeared back then. The dreamscape images, however, are
those that modern-day people feel for the area. For example,
if a terrible murder was committed in a certain house last
week, and the caster observes the house as it was one month
ago, before the murder, the dreamscape still shows her shadowy images of death and fear, for that is what people in the
current time associate with the house.
If the caster looks into the future, she sees the area as it is
most likely to appear. The future is uncertain and many factors
can change it, but she sees the area as it will most probably
appear — assuming that no one does anything significant
to alter it. Like looking into the past, the dreamscape reveals
images that modern-day people associate with the area. For
example, the caster may view a coastline as it will appear five
months from now and see the remains of a terrorist attack
— broken piers, dead bodies, ravaged beaches. Even though
five months from now people will associate the coastline with
horror and violence, currently they see it as a simple beach,
and the dreamscape images are people in swimsuits, beach
balls, and the like (and maybe the odd shark, as a nod to the
neurotic mothers of the world).

Groggy
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 22
Effect: 24 (-1D to two mental and two physical attributes)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-1): The caster yawns widely (simple)
The caster yawns hugely and, as all know, yawning is
contagious. The target follows suit. This spell magnifies the

target’s feeling of sleepiness, making him momentarily groggy
and unable to think straight, as if badly in need of rest. His
reflexes are slowed, his hand-eye coordination decreased,
and his mind easily distracted. He suffers a -1D penalty on
two mental and two physical attributes (such as Reflexes,
Knowledge, Coordination, and Perception in D6 Adventure)
for 12 rounds.

Insomnia
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 9 (Achilles’ Heel (R3), insomnia — -1 pip to all
mental and physical attributes, increasing by -1 pip for each
sleepless night)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1 week (+29)
Casting Time: 1 day (-25)
Other Aspects:
Charges (+5): 1 improved charge
Components (-8): A miniature sheep doll (common); 6
pins silver pins (common, destroyed)
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-2): The caster pushes a pin through the sheep
doll's head and pushes an additional pin into the doll
after every 24 hours (fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): “Sleep no more.” (phrase)
This spell makes it challenging for the target to sleep. His
sleeplessness is maddening and dulls his mind and body.
Each night following the end of the casting time, the target
must make a willpower/mettle roll versus a roll of the caster’s
willpower/mettle or be stricken with insomnia. He is unable
to sleep for one full night. In addition to being frustrating,
the next morning, the victim is mentally drained and physically fatigued. He suffers -1 pip to all mental and physical
attributes. This reduction accumulates for each night the
character cannot get sleep (by failing to make the roll). Napping during the day provides no relief.
No attribute can drop below 1D because of this spell.
The caster can add her result point bonus to the difficulty of
the willpower/mettle checks needed to shake off the spell.

Little Jackie’s Bedtime Stories

Description/History: Little Jackie’s Bedtime Stories
is a children’s book — on the surface. A fanciful color
painting on the front page depicts a boy (Little Jackie,
presumably) sleeping in a bed, moonlight spilling across
him, as a kindly woman watches him from a nearby
stool with a book resting closed on her lap. The narrative explains that Little Jackie is afraid of “ghosts
and ghoulies that come in the night,” and his mother
reads him a selection of bedtime stories that lull him
to sleep and argue against the existence of ghosts and

ghoulies. The bulk of the work consists of the stories
she tells him. They are written as rhyming poems and
accompanied by beautiful illustrations.
Yet the poems and pictures are more than they
seem.
If one looks closely at the illustrations in the book,
one may find a shadow or pair of glinting eyes where
none should be — hiding in the corner, or outside a
window, or peeking from a closet. Also, the careful
reader is left with a feeling of unease. Though the
poems are superficially lighthearted and explain that
monsters don’t exist, each poem has a line or stanza
or hidden meaning that seems to disprove the fact,
making the entire book an irony.
The stories also hide spells within them. They are
secreted in words, pictures, phrases, and deciphering
them is no easy task.
The book itself was, according to the date on the
cover, printed in 1756 in Belgium. It’s covered in
leather and its 48 pages are wrinkled and yellow. Still,
the glue seems to be holding, and most of the books
are in excellent condition. The inside front cover
states that the book had a limited print run: only one
hundred were ever produced. Each book also includes
a collector’s number, which tells which number out of
the hundred it is. The author is listed as Johan Kaplan,
though history records no one by this name who might
have written the book.
Contents: Though discovering them is difficult,
Little Jackie’s Bedtime Stories includes the following
spells: dream travel, insomnia, kiss of the sandman,
night terrors, nightmare, sleep eternal, sleep sense, and
step into sleep.
Protections: The book’s primary protection is its
code.
Language: Dutch.
Reading Period/Difficulty: Reading the book isn’t
hard (a languages/reading/writing check with a difficulty
of 7 accomplishes it), and takes 30 minutes.
Deciphering the hidden spells is harder. Each is
spread across multiple pages and included in text and
pictures. Each spell requires a scholar check with a
difficulty of 16. Characters with the dream, magic, or
equivalent Arcane Knowledge gain its bonus on this
check. Attempting to decipher a spell (successful or
not) takes five hours.

Kiss of the Sandman
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 21
Effect: 15 (difficulty for target to resist falling asleep)
Range: 2.5 meters (+2)
Speed: Instantaneous (+2)
Duration: 5 minutes (+13)
Casting Time: 3.5 seconds (-3)

Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+10): Cone with height and base radius
of 3 meters
Components (-2): Sand (ordinary, destroyed)
Focused (+5): On targets
Gestures (-1): Grab a handful of sand and blow it at the
targets (simple)
This spell drives the targets into a magic sleep. The caster
scoops up a handful of sand and blows upon it, whereupon it
billows out to create a cone with a tip that begins 2.5 meters
from the caster. The cone is three meters long and six meters
wide at its end. The first target hit by the spell must make
willpower/mettle roll with a difficulty of 15 or fall asleep. Those
up to one meter behind the first target have difficulty of 14,
those between one and two meters have a difficulty of 13,
and those between two and three meters have a difficulty of
12. Creatures in combat or some other high-energy situation
receive a +4 bonus on their willpower/mettle rolls.
Sleeping creatures remain magically asleep and do not
awaken normally, though other beings can shake them,
slap them, dump water on their heads, and perform other
actions in attempts wake them; doing so allows the sleeping
creature another chance to awake, again with a willpower/
mettle roll at the same difficulty that put him to sleep. (The
gamemaster may allow bonuses on this roll depending on
the vigor with which the characters attempt to awaken the
victim.) The awakening attempt may be tried once per round
at most; if one type of action fails, those trying to rose the
sleeper must find another way.
After the spell’s duration expires, the sleeping creatures
enter normal sleep and awaken normally (from loud noises,
being physically jostled, and so on).
The caster can add her result point bonus to the difficulty
of the willpower/mettle rolls to avoid the spell when other
people attempt to awaken the victims.
Somniomancers often use this spell as a precursor to other
spells, such as dream travel, step into sleep, or nightmare.

the duration ends. See kiss of the Sandman for restrictions

The caster may add her result point bonus to the difficulty

damage done each round (not both and chosen once for the
spell).

Effect: 41 (difficulty of 18 to resist falling asleep; 5D physical
damage, ignores nonmagical armor)
Range: 60 meters (+9)
Speed: Instantaneous (+9)
Duration: 1 minute/12 rounds (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-10): Amber dust (very rare, destroyed)
Multiple Targets (+15): Up to 5 targets
This spell puts up to five targets to sleep and then ravages
their minds with lethal nightmares. The targets must each
make a willpower/mettle roll with a difficulty of 18 or fall
asleep. This spell then burrows into the sleepers’ subconscious,
drawing forth their greatest fears and forming them into
horrific nightmares. They toss and thrash violently, obviously

Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 23
Effect: 12 (persuasion of 4D)
Range: 2.5 kilometers (+17)
Speed: Instantaneous (+17)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Other Conditions (-1): Touch or name single specific target,
who must be asleep
This spell allows the caster to deliver messages to sleeping creatures. The caster names a specific individual and
formulates an image or series of images, which can be up to
a minute in length, that appears in the named individual’s
dream. If the individual is not asleep, the spell fails. The
images can be anything the caster imagines that’s relatively
nonfrightening; the caster cannot give the target a nightmare,
though she may deliver threats and ultimatums. The caster
can use this dream to persuade the target as if she had 4D
in the persuasion skill.
The caster chooses whether or not the target remembers
the dream when he awakes. If the target does not remember
the dream, the dream may still influence him subconsciously,
at the gamemaster’s discretion.
In lieu of naming a specific individual, the caster may
make physical contact with the target (in which case, the
range is irrelevant).

Effect: 60 (10D physical damage, ignores all armor)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 second (-0)
Other Aspects:
Other Conditions (-1): Target must be asleep
The caster touches the creature and uses this spell to dredge
up his most feared images from his subconscious, using these
to create a horrific nightmare. The target thrashes, moans,
and sweats. He must make a willpower/mettle roll against a
roll of the caster’s willpower/mettle; if he fails, he dies of fear
(and cardiac arrest).
If the target is not asleep, this spell fails.

Nightshield

Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: magic
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 12 (Accelerated Healing (R1), +1D bonus to natural
healing attempts, and Arcane Knowledge: Dreams (R1)), +2
to casting of related Magic spells)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 10 hours (+23)
Casting Time: 10 minutes (-14)
Other Aspects:
Charges (+15): 3 improved charges
Components (-3): A really comfortable pillow (uncommon)
Other Conditions (-2): Target must want to fall asleep; spell
is broken if target is awakened during duration
The caster touches a pillow, imbuing it with an enchantment
that functions up to three times. Whenever a creature rests
on the pillow, whether intending to sleep or merely take a
short rest, over the course of one minute, the spell puts the
creature to sleep. The user sleeps deeply and well, untroubled
by nightmares or anxieties, for 10 hours and awakens feeling
refreshed and invigorated, providing a +1D bonus to natural healing attempts. This sleep is not magical, as it is with
kiss of the Sandman or night terrors; it’s simply a dreamless,
refreshing sleep. Loud noises, physical movement, and the
like awaken the sleeper normally.
The pillow can also aid in the casting of somniomancy
spells that involve the mage being asleep in order to work.
Using a really comfy pillow grants the caster a +2 bonus on
her appropriate Magic skill checks when she casts spells that
require her to meditate or sleep.

Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 30 (compare to spell total of spell attempting to
influence caster)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 10 hours (+23)
Casting Time: 1.5 hours (-19)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): A small shield of beaten silver (rare)
Other Conditions (-1): Awakening disrupts the spell
The mage places a small silver shield on her chest just
before she retires for the night, casting a spell that protects
her dreams from outside influence (such as the machinations
of another somniomancer). She adds her result point bonus
to the spell’s effect value. If a another mage casts a spell that
attempts to access her dreams or detecting whether she’s
sleeping, the second caster’s skill roll for that spell must
equal or exceed nightshield’s value (30 plus the caster’s result
point bonus) to affect her.
Example: Shannon casts nightshield before she goes to
sleep because she suspects her somniomantic rival, Bruce,
is on the prowl. She makes a conjuration roll to cast the spell
and rolls a total of 19. This roll generates a result point bonus
of 2, which she adds to nightshield’s effect value of 30, for a
total of 32. If Bruce shows up and attempts to cast nightmare
on Shannon, his alteration roll must equal or exceed 32 to
affect her.

Sleep Eternal
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 41
Effect: 20 (difficulty to resist falling asleep)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 10 years (+43)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+12): On target
Variable Duration (+4): Off only
Other Alterant (+1): Puts target in type of sleep the caster
chooses
This spell causes the target to enter an endless sleep, effectively killing him — or at least, killing him until the caster
chooses to release the curse.
The target, which must already be asleep, falls even deeper
into his sleep, so deep that he never awakens. When the caster

casts this spell, the target can make a willpower/mettle roll
with a difficulty of 20 to resist its effects; if he succeeds, he
awakens. If this roll fails, he doesn’t wake up for 10 years.
However, friends may attempt to bestir him; see kiss of the
Sandman for details on reviving a magically slumbering
character. The sleeper must have his nutrition intravenously
injected if he is to survive.
The caster can choose the nature of the target’s sleep. She
has three options:
• The target’s sleep is full of pleasant dreams. He sleeps
gently, with a smile upon his lips.
• The target’s sleep is dreamless. He appears to be in a
coma.
• The target’s sleep is uneasy, filled with vague nightmares.
He moans and twitches, obviously distressed.
The caster can end this spell at any time. The only other
way to awaken the target is to design a spell with the express
purpose of doing so.
The caster may add her result point bonus to the difficulty
of the target’s willpower/mettle rolls to resist the spell’s
effects.

Sleep of Champions
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 25
Effect: 36 (+1D to all mental and physical attributes)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 15 hours (+24)
Casting Time: 10 hours (-23)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+12): On caster
The caster spends two hours in preparation, then goes
to sleep. When she awakens, she feels refreshed. Her mind
is keen, her muscles flushed with energy, and her reflexes
at their peak. She receives a +1D bonus on all mental and
physical attributes for the next 15 hours.

Sleep Sense
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 28
Effect: 24 (search of 8D to locate sleeping creatures)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 15 hours (+24)
Casting Time: 15 minutes (-15)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+21): Divination sphere with radius of 25
meters
Components (-10): Small letter Zs made of gold (very
rare, destroyed)
Focused (+9): On caster
Gestures (-1): Toss the Zs into the air (simple)

Incantations (-2): “I see you when you’re sleeping.” (complete sentence)
Variable Movement (+5): Bending/unseen target
This spell allows the caster to detect sleeping creatures
without actively attempting to do so.
Over a 15-minute period, the caster tosses some small gold
Zs into the air while repeating the incantation. For the spell’s
duration, the caster always knows the exact locations of all
sleeping creatures within the area of effect that are the size
of a cat or larger. Walls and other obstructions do not inhibit
this spell, though sleep sense does not convey the knowledge
of how to access the sleepers, merely their locations.
Most somniomancers cast this spell at the beginning of
the day because it helps them find targets for some of their
other spells, like step into sleep, nightmare, and dream travel.

Sleeping Puppet
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 24 (Possession: Limited (R1))
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+8): On caster
Other Conditions (-2): Target must be sleeping; target
must be sentient
It is possible for the caster to enter into the dimension
of dreams and gain control over another sleep character’s
mind. The target must be capable of cognitive thought and
be of similar mind to the caster.
If the spell is successfully cast, then the magic user gets the
Possession: Limited (R1) Special Ability and must convince
or command the target to obey The sleeping target cannot
use willpower/mettle, as she is unaware that her mind is being
influenced; rather, she can use Presence. If the caster succeeds,
then the sleeper obeys, providing the command does not go
against the personal morals of the target. Walking, talking
and all normal actions can be executed so long as the mage is
successful. If a failure occurs, the target awakens from what
is thought to be a dream or nightmare — possibly far from
where she fell asleep.

Step Into Sleep
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 39 (Possessioin: Limited (R1) and investigation of
5D)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:

Components (-4): An item important to the target (uncommon)
Incantations (-1): “Open your dream to me.” (phrase)
Other Conditions (-1): Target must be asleep
This spell allows the caster to become part of the target’s
dream, delivering messages, showing her power, and performing many other actions that lesser spells do not allow.
If the target is not asleep, the spell fails. If he is asleep, the
caster enters the target’s dream. While in the target’s dreams,
the caster’s body is rigid and vulnerable, similar to a character
using the Possession: Limited Special Ability.
While within the dream, the caster can speak, cast spells,
use skills, and so on, but she cannot affect her surroundings in
any way. The sleeper continues to dream, and his subconscious
incorporates the caster into his dreams. The caster cannot
directly harm the target, but she can deliver messages, disrupt
his dreams, and so on. Similarly, the target’s dreams pose no
danger to the caster, though they may be frightening.
Additionally, the mage can observe the dreams, which
might tell the caster something about the target. Using
the “Posession Knowledge” chart and the investigation skill
granted by the spell, the somniomancer can gain information about the target, although it may be couched in dream
terms.
The caster can add her result point bonus to the investigation total.

Timeslip
Skill: Chronomancy
Arcane Knowledge: Dimension, Entity
Difficulty: 22
Effect: 13 (timeslip up to 400 kilograms, caster’s weight plus
their alternate self’s weight)
Range: 150 meters (+11)
Speed: instantaneous (+1)1
Duration: 1.5 rounds (+1)
Casting Time: 1 second (-0)
Other Aspects:
Components (-8): An ounce of quicksilver (uncommon,
destroyed)
Continence (-1): Caster sweats profusely and foams
at the mouth (noticeable)
Gestures (-3): The mage points off into the distance and
then pulls the visualized target toward them as she leaps
forward. (complex, action difficulty 11)
Incantations (-2): “See ya, wouldn’t want to be ya!” (sentence)
In desperate situations, some people are forced into
taking drastic actions to save their own skin. By invoking
the power of the timeslip, the caster changes place with a
counterpart from an alternate reality who returns to their
proper time when their spell runs its course. When the
hijacked future relative returns, the caster may choose to
reappear anywhere up to 150 meters from her previous location. The destination spot must be visible to the caster or at
the very least known to them (inner sanctum, the home of
a close friend etc.) when the timeslip is cast. Of course, the

abducted visitor not think very highly of being so rudely
abducted and could possibly have the power to revisit their
alternate self in order to avenge themselves. The payback
could be brutally painful.

Casting Time: 10 minutes (-14)
Other Aspects:
Other Conditions (-2): Target must be sleeping; awakening
target during the duration disrupts the spell
The target, which must be willing and about to go to sleep,
enters a particularly restful slumber that enhances his natural healing process. When the target makes natural healing
roll, he gets +2D on the roll. If the target needs seveal days
of rest before attempting the natural healing roll, the spell
should be cast on the last day of rest, as the effect lasts only
10 hours.

Somniomancy Tome

Description/History: The tome has never had a
title; scholars who know of its existence refer to it as
The Elven Book of Dreams.
Long ago, an unknown elven mage experimented
with somniomancy for the first time in her culture.
She was fascinated with the meaning behind dreams
and the ways magic might alter and divine them, and
her curiosity developed into somniomancy. She kept
a notebook of her reasoning, thoughts, theories, and,
most importantly, spells. When she died, the book
came into her apprentice’s hands, who added his own
musings and the spells he discovered. The Elven Book
of Dreams passed in this way through a dozen generations of elven somniomancers and has become a vast
and valuable receptacle of somniomantic lore. The
tome is currently in the possession of the elven wizard
Rallius Windslip, but as somniomancy is not his field
he does not add to the book’s pages. He allows visiting

scholars and mages to peruse the book, but he does
not let them borrow it; he is waiting, he says, for the
next elven somniomancer who is truly worthy to add
to the book’s knowledge.
Contents: The Elven Book of Dreams includes the
following spells: dream travel, dream visions, dreams in
hand, dreamtime, night terrors, nightmare, sleep eternal,
and true rest.
In addition, the book contains generations of writing and
musing about the nature of dreams and of somniomancy.
A character who spends 80 hours (total) reading the book
gains one rank in Arcane Knowledge: Dreams. When she
has the book on hand to use as reference, she gains an additional temporary rank. (The book is a good in-game excuse
to improve or gain Arcane Knowledge: Dreams.)
Protections: The book’s authors did not place
any protections upon it, but Rallius Windslip has. A
character who opens the book without his permission
is subject to a Bad Luck Curse (see the D6 Adventure
Rulebook, page 100).
Language: Elvish.
Reading Period/Difficulty: The Elven Book of
Dreams was written over many elven generations, and
during that time the elvish language evolved. Only a
true student of the language can manage to puzzle
through the book’s various dialects; doing so requires a
language: elvish check with a difficulty of 23. Succeeding
on this check and spending 80 hours studying the book
provides the reader with the benefits listed above.
Deciphering an individual spell is easier. Doing so
takes 30 minutes and a languages/reading/writing:
elvish check, the difficulty of which depends on the
spell. Those added to the book early in its history are
written in older dialects and thus are more difficult to
decipher. The difficulties are as follows:
• 19: dream visions, dreams in hand, sleep eternal,
true rest
• 15: dreamtime, nightmare
• 11: dream travel, night terrors

Waking Nightmare
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Dreams
Difficulty: 22
Effect: 24 (Fear (R12), +12 to initimidation totals and -12 to
combat difficulties against those affected by the fear)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+10): Circle with radius of 5 meters
Concentration (-2): 2 rounds with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+6): On target (nightmare only)

Unreal Effect (-7): Disbelief difficulty of 13
A knowledgeable mage can send her mind into the plane of
dreams and conjure a waking nightmare that can terrifying
anyone who believes it. If the spell’s conditions are satisfied,
and it is successfully cast, the mage inspires fear in a solitary
target or a group of creatures that occupy the radius of the
spell. This fear manifests itself as a walking nightmore to
those within the spell’s radius . The dread sight always stays
within the spell’s proximity of those affected by the spell
— though, if there’s a reason for them to do so, each target
may attempt to disbelieve the manifestation (instead of the
resistance difficulty listed with the Special Ability).

Other Aspects:
Concentration (-6): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 12
This spell allows the caster’s dreaming consciousness to
leave her body, roaming the world while she sleeps. The caster
spends one hour in preparation, meditating and otherwise
preparing her mind for its journey, then goes to sleep. Four
hours into her sleep (which counts as part of the casting
time), her dreaming consciousness leaves her body for one
hour, traveling as if the caster has 5D+2 in the Psionics: astral
projection skill.

Vitomancy
Animal Loyalty
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Animal
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 18 (+2D to caster’s animal handling or persuasion:
animals [D6 Space only]; +2D to target’s willpower/mettle)
Range: Self or touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+8): On caster and target
Gestures (-2): Gently stroke the target animal (fairly
simple)
Incantations (-1): Make soothing sounds (phrase)

Other Conditions (-2): Limited to animals that are friendly
to the caster; target and caster must remain within 10
meters of each other to get bonuses
To inspire unnatural loyalty in a pet, animal companion,
or mount, the caster simply strokes the creature and makes
reassuring, soothing sounds. For a full day thereafter, the
animal will be especially loyal to the caster, which translates
into an animal handling (or persuasion: animals in D6 Space)
bonus of +2D for the caster toward the target creature. In
addition, because the animal is so trusting of the caster,
whenever it’s within 10 meters of the caster, it gains a willpower/mettle bonus of +2D to resist attempts, magical or
otherwise, by others to alter its behavior.

Animal Savior
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Animal
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 18 (+2D to lifting/lift to recover fallen comrades;
+2D to willpower/mettle to resist attempts to dissuade
recovery)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Something from the type of animal targeted (very common); something from the individual to
be protected by the target animal (very common)
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-2): Draw a line on the ground (fairly simple)
Other Conditions (-1): Limited to animals
To cast this spell, the mage places on the ground something
from that type of animal to be targeted (strands of dog’s fur
or locks of horse’s hair, for example) and something from the
individual the animal is intended to watch over. She then
draws a line from these items toward the animal, and then
toward the individual to be protected.
For a period of one hour, the targeted animal keeps a watchful eye over its ward. Should the ward ever fall (rendered
unconscious, incapacitated, paralyzed, dead, or otherwise
unmoving), the animal will quickly descend upon the body
and pull it to a location out of harm’s way. This spell grants
the animal a +2D lifting/lift bonus for this purpose, allowing
even a small dog the ability to pull a human to safety, and
a +2D willpower/mettle bonus to resist efforts to dissuade
intervention.
While there is no range limitation on how far the animal
will theoretically pull the character, the location to which
the immobilized character is moved is always the nearest
“safe” place. This might mean dragging the body out of a
room, behind a tree, into a defile, or any other such sheltered
locale. In an environment where there is no readily available protection, such as barren and flat desert or plains, the
animal pulls the body far enough away to be removed from
the melee and out of range of whatever missile weapons the
enemy possesses (if any).

Asp Arrow
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Animal
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 18 (4D damage, ignores nonmagical armor)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Component (-4): A live asp or other poisonous snake
(uncommon)
Focused (+5): On target
Gestures (-2): Crouch as if coiled like a snake, shape hand
into a fist with two fingers extended like asp fangs,
then spring and throw the gathered energy at target
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): Make a snake-like sound (phrase)
To cast this spell, the mage must have a live asp or other
poisonous snake on his person. Usually, mages keep them in
small earthenware pots or reed baskets. By coiling himself as
a snake would, not only is he drawing upon energy to propel
the mystical arrow but is also tapping into the essence of the
snake itself. Once the mystical energy is released, an arrow
appears and flies toward the intended target, to a range of
10 meters. The mage must make a marksmanship/firearms or
apportation roll to hit the target. If the arrow flies true and
hits, it immediately transforms into a large asp and delivers
a poisonous bite., which causes 4D of damage each round
for one minute. The asp arrow must be fired in the round
after the mage casts the spell. The mage may add the result
point bonus of the spell to either the targeting total or the
first damage total.

To cast the spell, the mage must first put on a pair of black
leather gloves. The mage then lets out a roar as mighty as he
can muster and punches each of his fists into an open hand,

all the while feeling himself become overwhelmed with a
sense of pent-up rage. This violent urge must be released
within the next five rounds or it dissipates, and can only be
released in unarmed combat. The spell provides the Natural
Hand-to-Hand Weapons: Fists Special Ability, which gives the
attacker +2D to his unarmed Strength Damage. In addition
to damage inflicted, each blow landed by the mage pushes
his foe. This causes the victim to stumble, reducing all Agility/Reflexes or related totals by 3 until the mage’s turn in
the next round.

Beast Warden
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Animal
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 18 (+4D to intimidation)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+15): Sphere with radius of 3 meters
Components (-8) Rowan berries (uncommon,
destroyed)
Countenance (-2): Animal appears menancing
Gestures (-2): Point from target to those to be guarded,
bear teeth and snarl (fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): “Guard.” (phrase)
Unreal Effect (-8): Disbelief difficulty of 13
Other Alterants (+10): Animal will fight to the death to
keep captives in area of effect
Other Conditions (-2): May only be used on animals who
are friendly to the caster
To cast this spell, the mage must have a small supply berries harvested from a rowan tree. The mage points at the
animal he wishes to target, then at a creature or creature he
wishes the animal to guard, snarling and bearing his teeth
to get the point across. After uttering a simple command
word, the spell is cast. The target animal devotedly keeps
the specified beings in a confined area measuring three
meters in diameter by circling. In the eyes of its captives, the
animal’s countenance changes completely, become far more
frightening and imposing. As a result, the animal gains an
intimidation skill bonus of +4D.
Most captives are too frightened to attempt escape, save
for those who make a willpower/mettle roll of 13 to disbelieve
the spell’s effect. Captives attempting to escape find themselves harrassed immediately upon trying to leave the area
of effect. The animal attacks until either it or the prisoner
is dead or subdued.
While predators are most often targeted, this spell is by
no means limited to them. Herbivores, such as boars, deer,
and bulls, can be equally effective.

Blades of Flesh
Cantrip
Skill: Conjuration

Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 3
Effect: 6 (Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon: Blades of Flesh
(R1), +1D damage)
Range: Self or target within 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): Any bladed weapon (common)
Focused (+2): On target
Gestures (-2): Draw weapon across hand (fairly simple)
This spell gives the target a bonus of +1D to Strength
Damage for 25 seconds, or five rounds. With the simple slash
of a blade, the spell transforms the target’s hands, elbows,
and feet into lethal blades of flesh that can slash or pierce
as well as bludgeon.

Club Feet
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Animal, Folk
Difficulty: 31
Effect: 36 (Hindrance: Club Feet (R12): +4 to the difficulty
of any foot-related skill use and -4 to initiative rolls)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+10): On target
Gestures (-3): Mime tripping and falling, eyes focused on
target (complex; acrobatics roll with difficulty of 11)
Incantations (-2): “I’m such a clumsy oaf.” (sentence)
While willingly causing himself to trip and fall (acrobatics
roll of 11 or fail the spell due to ineptitude), and casually
excusing himself for his clumsiness, the mage casts this
potent spell and curses a target not more than 10 meters
away. The curse twists the victim’s feet until they are horribly misshapen, rendering his legs so uncoordinated that
he can literally trip over himself. This is reflected by a +4
to the difficulties of various foot-related tasks and a -4 to
initiative totals. When the spell wears off 10 minutes later,
the character is restored immediately to normal.

Cobra Strike
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk, Animal
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 18 (3D damage, ignores all armor)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Charges (+11): 2 improved charges released only with
successful attack

Components (-6): Cobra skin gloves (very rare); flute (very
common)
Focused (+5): On target
Gestures (-3): Play tune on a flute (complex; artist roll
with difficulty of 11)
This spell requires the caster to wear cobra skin gloves
and have a flute. The mage casts the spell by playing a short
tune on her flute, the kind that snake-charmers use to lure
cobras from their wicker pots. On the next round, as the mage
attemtps to land an open-handed strike, her hand spreads out
like a hood, and the head of a cobra momentarily appears in
the palm to strike the target. On a successful attack, the blow
inflicts normal unarmed damage and for five rounds (starting
with the one in which the blow landed), the victim is poisoned
and takes 3D damge per round until duration ends.

Courage
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 23
Effect: 30 (+6D+2 to willpower/mettle)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10
Duration: 2.5 minutes (+11)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+25): Sphere with radius of 5 meters
Components (-4): Braided lion’s mane rope (very rare)
Concentration (-1): 3 seconds with willpower/mettle difficulty of 7
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance totals
Gestures (-3): Hold the lion’s mane rope above the head
and shake it while turning in a circle (complex; acrobatics
roll with difficulty of 11)
Incantations (-3): “Fight by me, my friends, and together
we’ll taste victory or achieve immortality” (sentence,
loud)
Other Conditions (-2): Limited to sentient beings and
those who are neutral or trusting of the mage
Casting this spell requires the mage to have a rope braided
from lion’s mane. He holds the rope aloft as a symbol of courage and shakes it mightily as he turns in a complete circle,
demonstrating its importance to all around him.
For a period of more than two minutes thereafter, his mere
presence steadies his allies when terror would otherwise fill
their hearts and shake their resolve. All allies with a 5-meter
radius gain a willpower/mettle skill bonus of +6D+2 for resisting fear, intimidation, or even pain and torture.
Under the influence of this spell, only the most weak
hearted of characters will break rather than present a stoic
face to their enemies. If a character affected by fear is rallied by her companions, she may roll again to shake off the
effect. This spell can only be used on sentient beings, and it
only affects individuals who are neutral toward or trusting
of the mage.

Eagle-Eye
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Folk, Avian
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 18 (+4D to search)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 5 rounds (-7)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+15): Divination sphere with radius of 10
meters
Component (-8): Eye of an eagle (uncommon,
destroyed)
Concentration (-3): 25 seconds with a willpower/mettle
difficulty of 9
Focused (+5): On caster
Gestures (-1): Ingest the eagle’s eye (simple)
Variable Duration (+8): On/off switch
Other Conditions (-6): -6 to Agility/Reflexes and related
totals while spell is active
The caster ingests an eye of an eagle, closes his eyes, and
concentrates. When he opens his eyes after 25 seconds, the
mage perceives a bird’s eye view of his surrounding area, as
though he was looking down from the vantage point of a
soaring eagle. The mage gains awareness of all objects within
10 meters of his person that are large enough to normally
be seen with his eye. However, the mage cannot see under
or through solid objects.
The area of effect moves with the caster until the spell
dissolves after one minute.
Creatures may attempt to hide from the mage, but he gains
a search bonus of +4D to see them because of his vantage
point. This may have the unintended and happy side effect
of preventing surprise — assuming the mage notices his
attackers before they strike.
The mage may target spells at anything he sees through
this spell as if he had line of sight. However, he must still
account for cover. For example, a character hiding behind
an overturned table still enjoys such cover as it provides,
even though he is clearly seen through the mage’s bird’s eye
view; remember, the spell still originates from the mage’s
physical form.
The unusual perspective can be disorienting for the mage,
and during the spell’s duration, he suffers -6 to all Agility/
Reflexes and related totals while spell is active.

Envy
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 9 (Quirk (R3), envy requiring a Very Difficult willpower/mettle roll to overcome Disadvantage)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 4 hours (+21)

Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance totals
Focused (+6): On target
While casting this spell is moderately painful to the mage,
it might well be the death of the target. The caster curses a
humanoid target that she can see with four hours of extreme
envy. Envy is the desire to possess what others have. Those
afflicted with envy covet what others have —personality
traits, personal good fortune, and material goods. The need
to prove themselves, to obtain a perceived glory or possess
a valuable item, often places the individuals in potentially
dangerous situations — they might rush to disarm a trap,
push other characters aside to be the first to fight a foe, or race
to secure a treasure headless of potential risks. A character
targeted by this spell must make a Very Difficult willpower/
mettle roll to overcome his envious impulses.

Gang Fight
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 27
Effect: 27 (+2D to brawling/fighting and melee combat; +2D
to intimidation)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+6): On targets
Gestures (-3): Frown menacingly and point with authority at allies (complex; intimidation roll with difficulty
of 11)
Incantations (-3): “Rip ’em apart, boys” (sentence, loud)
Multiple Targets (+18): Up to 6 targets
Other Conditions (-2): Targets must be allies of the caster
and either outnumber the oppoents or have them at a
decisive disadvantage
When the mage attempts to cast this spell, he must present a commanding and frightful image by succeeding an
intimidation roll with a difficulty of 11. If she fails this, she
simply doesn’t present herself with enough menacing authority and the spell doesn’t work. If successful, however, mage
makes up to six allies fight with ruthless vigor, employing all
manner of dirty tricks and providing them a bonus to their
close combat skills of +2D. It also lends them a menacing air,
resulting in an intimidation bonus of 2D.
The targets must outnumber their opponents or have a
marked disadvantage, because the thuglike tactics the caster
wishes her allies to employ depend to a large degree upon
intimidation and ganging-up on victims.

Gnawing Hunger
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Animal, Folk

Difficulty: 35
Effect: 36 (4D damage, ignores all armor; Achilles’ Heel (R4),
metabolic difference — must eat a meal every two hours or
all mental and physical attributes decrease by 1 pip, with
penalty increasing by 1 pip for each hour without food and
disappearing with consumption of food )
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Any food item that might be eaten by
the intended target (ordinary, destroyed)
Countenance (-2): The caster’s skin tightens around the
cheeks in a sickly fashion
Focused (+12): On target
Gestures (-3): Double over in direction of the target as if
suffering severe abdominal pain (fairly simiple)
Incantations (-3): “Hunger gnaws like a ravenous beast!”
(sentence, loud)
To cast this spell, the mage must have in an item of food
that the target might reasonably be expected to eat (meat for
a carnivore, plants for an herbivore). She holds this item in
her hand while pointing a finger at the target, and when she
doubles over mimicking stomach pains as the food crumbles
to dust. While performing these actions, she utters a simple
but malicious phrase, after which the target suffers 4D damage
from intense stomach pains. The target literally begins starving to death and at an accelerated pace. ll mental and physical
attributes decrease by 1 pip (with the penalty increasing by
1 pip for each hour without food) due to weakness. These
penalties are negated once the target has eaten.

Graceful Step
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Animal, Folk
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 18 (+1D+1 to acrobatics, dodge, and sneak/stealth)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+5): On target
Gestures (-2): Shake one leg, then the next (fairly
simple)
This spell makes the target graceful for a period of five
rounds, which affects her acrobatics, dodge, and sneak/stealth
attempts and increases them by 1D+1.

Pollen Cloud
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Plant
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 6 (2D of cover modifier)
Range: 3 meters (+3)

Speed: Instantaneous (+3)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+15): Sphere with radius of 3 meters
Components (-2): Fresh flower bloom (very common,
destroyed)
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Focused (+2): On target
Gestures (-1): Bring bloom to lips and gently blow
(simple)
Incantations (-1): “Belladonna’s breath.” (phrase)
Other Conditions (-1): Spell negated by strong winds
With some minor pain to herself, the mage creates a cloud
of pollen. To cast this spell, she must have a fresh flower,
which she brings to her lips and then blows in the intended
direction. After uttering a simple incantation, a dense cloud of
pollen emerges from the bloom and quickly fills a six-meterwide sphere. The pollen cloud is as thick as fog, providing
2D of cover modifier. Under normal conditions, the cloud
dissipates after five rounds. However, in moderately windy
conditions it blows away after two rounds, and heavy winds
prevent the spell from working entirely.

Quick Release
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 12 (Fast Reactions (R1), +1D to initiative roll and one
additional free action in each of 3 rounds, with Ability Loss
(R1), only useful with throwing; +2D to throwing)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 5 minutes (+13)
Casting Time: 3.5 seconds (-3)
Other Aspects:
Components (-6): Spearhead (common, destroyed)
Focused (+5): On caster
Gestures (-1): Squeeze palms together with spearhead
between (simple)
The caster places a spearhead in his hands and crushes
it between his palms, leaving his hands bloodied and the
spearhead mere dust. Until the blood dries (a period of about
10 minutes), the mage becomes extremely fast at releasing
thrown weapons. This results in +1D bonus to his initiative
roll when wielding thrown weapons. In addition, because
he can release weapons with such amazing speed, he can
make an additional throwing attack in up to three rounds.
This spell provides no benefit when using missile weapons
or firearms.

Reveal Disposition
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 24 (willpower/mettle of 8D)
Range: 1 meter (+0)

Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 10 seconds with willpower/mettle
difficulty of 8
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance totals
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-1): Make a gesture of friendship (simple)
Other Conditions (-3): Target must interact with the target; may only be used on a single sentient being who
understand the caster’s language
This spell is particularly useful by individuals involved in
delicate diplomacy. After meditating in silence for 10 seconds,
the mage warmly introduces herself to the individual that she
wants to influence. The person must be a sentient being who
understands her language. If the target doesn’t comprehend
her, the spell and her time are wasted. Interpreters aren’t
sufficient, as the spell relies upon personal interaction and
common ground.
When the spell is successfully cast, the mage rolls the willpower/mettle from the spell against the opponent’s willpower/
mettle. By beating this difficulty, the caster senses the target’s
disposition toward her by seeing a glowing aura around it.
The aura is visible only to the mage. A white light suggests
the target is friendly or trusting; a gray-shaded aura indicates
that he is neutral or ambivalent. A shadow falling over the
target indicates he is hostile or has superior standing.
Since this spell lasts for 10 minutes, the mage may track how
the target’s disposition changes over the course of negotiations, allowing her to know the effectiveness of her diplomacy
and attempts to change the target’s disposition. Because the
mage can sense the nature of the target’s intentions (positive,
ambivalent, or harmful), she enjoys a willpower/mettle of 8D
when resisting his interaction attempts.

Sense Ailment
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Animal, Folk
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 17 (medicine/healing of 5D+2)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (+5)
Other Aspects:
Component (-5): An egg (very common, destroyed); bowl
of water (ordinary)
Concentration (-2): 10 seconds with willpower/mettle
difficulty of 8
Gestures (-2): Run egg over patient and then crack it open
into the bowl (fairly simple)

This spell allows a mage to tell if a creature suffers from the
effects of poison, disease, or illness. Before casting this spell,
she enters a trance-like state while she runs an egg repeatedly over the body of the patient. She then cracks it open
into a bowl of water. Using the skill provided by the spell,
the mage can interpret the egg’s appearance to determine
presence and type of disease, toxin, or injury.
If the egg yoke floats to the surface, the patient is free of
ailments. If the yoke sinks, on the other hand, the creature
is ill and the mage may figure out the cause.
The difficulty to detect the presence of an ailment is 7.
With five to eight result points, the mage understands the
nature of the ailment. With nine to 16 result points, the
caster knows the cure. With 17 or more result points, the
healer figures out the cause.
This spell does not heal a patient of his ailment, nor does
it provide any bonus to healing wounds or injuries.

Stick to Snake
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Plant, Animal
Difficulty: 23
Effect: 40 (brawling/fighting of 5D; running of 2D; 5D physical
damage; movement equal to result points in meters round
with minimum of 1 meter per round)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 5 minutes (+13)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Component (-5): A long, thin dried stick (ordinary); rattlesnake tail rattle (uncommon)
Focused (+10): On stick
Gestures (-1): Shake rattlesnake rattle while holding stick
(simple)
Incantations (-2): “Wood to flesh and stick to snake.”
(sentence).
This spell turns a dead branch or other long pieces of thin,
dried wood (arrow shafts, broomsticks, and so on) into a
large and aggressive snake. To cast this spell, the mage must
have one hand on the wood while he shakes a rattlesnake tail
rattle. After reciting the incantation, he drops the stick and
watches as it comes to life as a flesh-and-blood snake.
If provoked, the snake attacks whomever or whatever is
near it. When killed or the spell expires, the snake reverts
back to its original form.

Sticky Fingers
Cantrip
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 5
Effect: 9 (+2D to sleight of hand)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Ball of wax (very common, destroyed)
Focused (+3): On caster
Gestures (-1): Rub fingers together (simple)
The caster places a small ball of wax in each hand and rubs
his fingers tips together, spreading the wax evenly over his
fingertips. His fingers then become sticky and more nimble,
allowing him to pick pockets, palm objects, and perform
similar actions that require deft motor control with unnatural
ease. As a result, the character gains a sleight of hand bonus
of +2D.
The sticky substance secreted by the character’s fingers is
not strong enough to have any direct application to climbing,
grappling, or any other related action that requires the use
of strength as opposed to mere deftness of hand.

Taken Alive
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Death, Folk
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 30 (+6D+2 to bluff/con)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 4 hours (+21)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-12): Garment made of valuable fabric
(uncommon, destroyed); fire, such as match or lit coal
(very common, destroyed)
Concentration (-3): 25 seconds with a willpower/mettle
difficulty of 9
Focused (+10): On target
Gestures (-1): Inhale smoke (simple)
Unreal Effect (-8): Disbelief difficulty of 13
Other Alterants (+2): Also works unconsciously
Other Conditions (-1): May only be used on those that
understand the concepts of wealth and ransom
While casting the spell, the mage sets on fire a garment
made of valuable fabric, such as a foreign cloth or silk. She

then inhales the smoke while concentrating for almost half
a minute.
Once the casting is complete, the mage (or her desired target) exudes an aura that makes her enemies believe she is less
valuable dead than she is alive as ransom. When surrendering, the caster gains a bluff/con bonus of +6D+2 to convince
opponents of her worth and to spare her life by taking her
prisoner, rather killing her. She also may bluff opponents
into believing her inflated worth even when unconscious or
otherwise incapacitated, as the enemy perceives noble standing or cultured bearing even in her motionless form.
Of course, the enemy will expect that a ransom is forthcoming, and after the spell’s duration expires the captive mage
loses her bluff/con skill bonus and is no longer necessarily
viewed as a valuable commodity.
This spell only affects those that understand the concepts
of wealth and ransom.

Taunt
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 18 (+4D to intimidation)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+5): On caster
Gestures (-2): Make a contemptous gesture at opponent
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-3): “Is that the best you got?”, followed by
piteous laughter (sentence, offensive)
Other Conditions (-2): May only be used attackers who
understand the caster’s language and can hear the
caster
This spell is cast with a smile that conveys contempt for
an opponent’s abilities, a taunting gesture that urges him to
attack the mage, and an insulting incantation that suggests
nothing but disdain. For a period of a minute thereafter, the
mage improves his initimidation skill by +5D when taunting his opponents in combat, goading them into anger and
careless action. He adds one-half of the difference between
the difficulty and the initimidation roll to any one attack or
defense attempt (not both) made at Point Blank or Short
range. This bonus works only if the opponent is actively
attacking the mage; the spell provides no bonus to a mage
fighting a creature that is purely defensive and doesn’t want
to fight. In addition, the spell only works against those who
can hear the mage speaking.

Voice Wrack
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 21 (Hindrance: Hoarse (R7), +3 to difficulties of
actions requiring a voice, such bargain, charm, con, command,
intimidation, languages/speaking, and persuasion)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+6): On target
Gestures (-2): Rub throat as if sore and then point at target
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): Cough and whisper “steal voice.”
(phrase)
Other Conditions (-2): Limited to those who can speak;
spell has no effect at 1 meter or less from target
The mage rubs his throat as if it’s irritated, then points at
a target and, coughing, whispers a simple incantation. The
spell mutes the subject’s words so that his voice projects as
a mere whisper. Those within a meter of the target can hear
his words as normal, but those beyond that range are hard
pressed to make out a sound. Interactions with those further
than one meter distant are challenging (+3 to related difficulties), because his voice carries no weight or inflection.

Wolfpack
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Animal
Difficulty: 17
Effect: 9 (+2D to brawling/fighting)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-10): Something from the type of animal
with which she wants to communicate (very common);
tuff of wolf fur (uncommon, destroyed)
Focused (+3): On targets
Gestures (-2): Toss wolf fur at target creatures while
holding the component of the animals to be affected
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-2): “Fight like the wolf!” followed by a wolflike howl (phrase, loudly)
Multiple targets (+24): 8 targets
Other Conditions (-1): Animals affected must outnumber
their opponents
To cast the spell, the caster must have something from the
type of animal to be affected (feathers from a bird, shed snake
skin, hairs from a horse’s mane), as well as a tuff of wolf fur.
Upon uttering the incantation, the wolf fur is released and
is instantly consumed by magical fire.

This spell can be used on any animal or monster, but
sentient beings are unaffected. The target creatures must
also outnumber their opponents, because the rabid wolflike tactics induced by this spell depend upon the ability
to outflank and overwhelm their enemies. For five rounds,
all affected creatures fight with a ferocity and cunning that
provides them a brawling/fighting bonus of +2D.

Wayward Practices of the Savage
Peoples of the Northwest Coast
Description/History: This 200-page book was
originally published back in the 1880s, though later
handwritten notes surround much of the text. The
book itself was a treatise on the rites of various Indian
tribes inhabiting the British Columbia and Alaska
coasts, written by one Jonathon Whitelock. It’s a rather
bland treatise. More interesting, for arcane scholars,
is the handwritten portions that detail specific rituals
and spells.
The handwritten portions were set down by a dabbler in the arcane who went by the name of “Klondike
Ike” (actually, Ichobad Cranston), but he never finished
his work: It was 1898. The gold stampede was on, and
Klondike Ike went to make his fortune. With his wealth,
he’d publish his book and reveal his knowledge to the
world. But he never returned. The legend is that he
perished in an avalanche, buried several meters deep
in ice and snow.
Contents: The book contains a myriad of spells, all
cloaked under the guise of Indian rituals and prayers.
The spells appearing in the D6 Fantasy or D6 Adventure
Rulebook are communicate with animals (“Commune
with Spirits of Our Forest Brothers”), meal or feast
(‘Nootka Blessing’), and scrying (“Asin’s Wisdom”).
Spells appearing in D6 Magic include animal loyalty
(“Friendship of Our Forest Brothers”), asp arrow (“Arrow
of Sisiutl”), gnawing hunger (“Crying Stomach”), sense
ailment (“Ritual of Chulyen”), and stick to snake (“Sisiutl
in Wood”). Gamemasters may include any other spells
they desire.
Protections: If the book is pried from the cold,
lifeless grip of Klondike Ike, the ominous rumblings of
an impending avalanche can be heard. Unless escape
is immediate and swift, Klondike Ike may have eternal
company in his frozen grave.
Languages: The book is written in sloppy English,
but much of the handwritten notes use Indian words
and references that Klondike Ike was presumably

familiar with but that most readers would find completely alien.
Reading Period/Difficulty: The difficulty to decipher each spell is a Moderate languages/reading/writing
roll and takes about 12 weeks.

is then consumed in a brilliant, momentary flash of fire. Now
the target creature is bathed in an aura of shimmering white
light that only the magic user can see. The aura is so bright
that it negates up to -4D of darkness modifier (including the
effects of fog, smoke, and mist), allowing the mage to see
and attack the creature without penalty in even the most
complete darkness.

Blur
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness, Folk
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 18 (Blur (R2) Special Ability).
Range: Self or 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+5): On target
Gestures (-1): Wipe palm over eyes (simple)
Unreal Effect (-5): Disbelief difficulty of 13
With a casual swipe of a hand over his eyes, the mage
(or his chosen target) becomes indistinct to the naked eye
by bending light over his form. For a period of one minute,
the mage adds 2 to his dodge, stealth/sneak, and hide totals,
as +2 to all default search, tracking, investigation, and attack
difficulties against the mage. As this is an illusory spell,

characters may disbelieve the effects with a mettle/willpower
roll of 13. Those who succeed are thereafter able to see the
mage distinctly.

undead targets within range and looking at the caster are
blinded by this light. All sight-based actions for the affected
increase by +5 for one minute.

Glowing Eyes

Light Chest

Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 6 (Infamy (R2), feared by most because of glowing
eyes)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 4 hours (+21)
Casting Time: 2 round (-5)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+5): On target
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
With a minimal amount of pain to himself, the caster curses
a target with glowing eyes, thereby giving the creature the
look of that which is demon possessed or otherwise infernal
in nature. This makes it extremely difficult for the afflicted
to interact successfully with other beings, as people become
ill at ease by his unnatural appearance. The target has no
means of knowing that he has been cursed except perhaps
by looking in a mirror or other reflective surface.
In some cases, the spell may actually incur a bonus. If
the mage wanted to pass himself off as a demon or use it
against extremely superstitous folk, for example, it might
provide some minor skill total bonuses (determined by the
gamemaster).

Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light, Dimension
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 18 (Armor Value of 6D, physical only)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 week (+29)
Casting Time: 3.5 minutes (-12)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+5): Cuboid with height of 1 meter and
sides of 2 meters
Components (-12): Crystal cube (very rare, destroyed);
small glass disc (very common)
Concentration (-2): 5 seconds with a willpower/mettle
difficulty of 8
Focused (+9): On glass disc
Gestures (-2): Hold crystal cube and disk in outstretched
hands to catch the light, then place it at feet (fairly
simple)
Incantations (-2): “Chest of light, secure what’s mine by
right.” (sentence)
Variable Duration (+8): On/off switch with password set
by mage
Other Alterants (+2): Can be carried; resistant to adverse
environmental conditions (dust, rain, heat, etc.)
Other Conditions (-1): A source of illumination is present
The magic user casts this spell on a glass disc and a finely
crafted cube of crystal, which is destroyed and replaced by a
chest of radiant light. The chest had no weight, but its walls
and lid are solid and it can be moved.
When the spell is cast, the mage selects a password, and the
chest cannot be opened by any creature, including the mage,
unless the password is first spoken. Efforts at lockpicking are
futile. Any item, or combination of items, measuring less than
four cubic meters can be stored within the magical chest.

Holy Light
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light
Difficulty: 35
Effect: 45 (Hindrance: Blindness (R15), +5 to difficulties of
all sight-dependent actions)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 3.5 seconds (-3)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-2): With head titled back and eyes closed as if
basking in the sun’s warmth, extend arms out to the
sides (fairly simple)
Incantations (-3): “The sun abhors darkness, and evil cowers
from the light that is goodness.” (sentence, loud)
Multiple Targets (+15): Up to 5 targets
Other Conditions (-2): Only affects evil or undead beings
who can see the caster
When cast, the magic user creates a bright flare of light
that seems to emanate from his being. Up to five evil or

The chest lasts for one week and then disappears, leaving
behind the glass disk and any items that had been stored
within.

Light Ram
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light, Inanimate Forces
Difficulty: 17
Effect: 33 (4D physical damage; Reduced Attribute: Agility/
Reflexes (R7), -2D to the attribute)
Range: 15 meters (+6)
Speed: Instantaneous (+6)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Components (-7): Horn or tusk of a charging animal (common); tuff of wool (very common, destroyed)
Countenance (-1): Mage appears drained and winded
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance totals
Gestures (-2): Tuff of wool is released into the air and the
horn violently shaken at the target (fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): “Unleash the might of light.” (phrase)
Other Alterant (+1): Effect appears as a powerful, charging animal
To cast this spell, the mage releases a tuff of wool into the
air (which is subsequently consumed by flame), shakes a ram’s
horn at an individual target, and utters a simple incantation.
Immediately thereafter, a shimmering mass of glowing light
appears, which vaguely discernible as a ram (or, in cultures
where more appropriate, a bull, bison, elephant, or other
powerful animal known for charging enemies). When this
unleashed force strikes a target within 15 meters, it deals
4D damage.
The force of the blow is overwhelming; targets hit by the
spell feel as if they have indeed been impacted by a raging
ram and are staggered, if not thrown back. As a result, a
character struck by the spell is also subject to a 2D penality
to Agility/Reflexes-related actions until the target’s turn in
the next round.
In addition to being used as a weapon, light ram can also
be used to batter down doors it strikes. This is particularly
handy during dungeon and building explorations.
The mage must succeed with a marksmanship/firearms or
apportation roll to hit the target.

Light Show
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Light
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 16 (lights with charm/persuasion of 5D+1)
Range: 60 meters (+9)
Speed: Instantaneous (+9)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:

Components (-8): Jar of fireflies or similar glowing insects
(uncommon, destroyed)
Gestures (-2): Point finger at target and release fireflies
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): “Watch and be amazed.” (phrase)
To cast this spell, the mage must have a jar of living fireflies
or similar insects. He simply says a few words of power, points
a finger at the target, and releases the fireflies (which die upon
the spell expiring). For a period of one minute, the fireflies
become flashing, dancing orbs of glowing light, many times
greater in intensity than normal and far more enthralling.
Should the target fail an opposed interaction roll against
the light’s charm/persuasion of 5D+1, the target of the spell
is compelled to do nothing but watch them.
If the entranced creature is harmed, it recovers its senses
and is no longer affected by the spell.

Mass Light Show
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light
Difficulty: 24
Effect: 15 (lights with charm/persuasion of 5D)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+20): 10-meter radius circle
Components (-8): Jar of fireflies or similar glowing insects
(uncommon, destroyed)
Gestures (-2): Point finger at target and release fireflies
(fairly simple)
Incantations (-2): “Watch and be amazed, one and all”
(sentence)
After saying a few words of power and pointing a finger at
the center of the intended 10-meter circle area of effect, she
releases the fireflies (which die upon the spell expiring). For
a period of one minute the fireflies become flashing, dancing
orbs of bright, enthralling light. All living creatures within
the area of effect must make an opposed interaction roll
against the spell’s charm/persuasion of 5D or be compelled to
do nothing but watch them. Harming any entranced creature
breaks the spell.

Night Vigilance
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 18 (+4D to search)
Range: Self or target within 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 4 hours (+21)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:

Components (-8): Owl’s eye (uncommon, destroyed)
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-2): Pass the owl eye over the eyes of the target
Incantations (-1): “See better.” (phrase)
Other Conditions (-1): Can only be cast at night
This spell uses an owl’s eye to increase the nighttime
vigilance and acuity of a single individual. The mage utters
a short phrase while passing the component over the eyes
of the intended target. When the spell is cast, the owl’s eye
turns to dust.
The subject of this spell becomes extremely attuned to the
night and unusually aware of his surroundings for a period
of four-hours. During this time, the character gains a search
bonus of +5D. However, this spell in no way reduces the need
for sleep or the negative effects resulting from lack of rest.
The target of the spell must still sleep 4+ hours or suffer the
effects of fatigue.

Nyctophobia
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness, Folk
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 9 (Quirk (R3), nyctophobia with Very Difficult willpower/mettle roll to overcome)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 2 round (-5)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+4): On target
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Other Conditions (-1): Limited to sentient beings
Though the caster of this spell endures some pain to herself, she curses a person with a severe case of nyctophobia
(fear of the dark or night) for 10 minutes. Characters that
are overcome by their fright dissolve into quivering wrecks.
They can take no actions until the darkness is eliminated or
they’re removed from the darkened environment (at which
point they may make another attempt to overcome the
fright using willpower/mettle or the default attribute). The
expiration of the spell’s duration immediately returns the
target to normal.
(((illo s5-3)))

Shadow Surface
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness
Difficulty: 27
Effect: 20 (difficulty to view hidden area or dispel darkness
shrouding it)
Range: 2.5 meters (+2)
Speed: Instantaneous (+2)
Duration: 1 year (+38)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)

Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+18): Sphere with 3-meter radius and shape
decided on at casting
Components (-4): Stick of charcoal (very common,
destroyed)
Countenance (-1): Caster develops dark rings under eyes
during casting time
Gestures (-2): Outline the area of effect with charcoal
(fairly simple)
Other Conditions (-2): Limited to areas continuously in
darkness or shadow
Shadow surface allows a mage to create illusionary walls,
floors, ceilings, or other surfaces out of darkness. To cast
it, the wizard outlines the illusionary surface’s dimensions
with a charcoal stick.
The surface appears absolutely real when viewed, but
physical objects may pass through it effortlessly. The spell
is often used to mask doors, pits, or traps within tombs,
fortresses, or other areas intended to be secure. Touch or
probing searches always reveal the true nature of the surface,
though they do not cause the illusion to disappear. The only
means by which the illusion might be removed, save for its
duration expiring, is by exposure to a light source strong
enough to negate it.

Shroud of Shade
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness, light, entity
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 12 (Armor Value of 4D, physical only)
Range: Self or target within 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 2.5 hours (+20)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-8): Fragment of a funeral shroud from an
occupied grave (uncommon, destroyed).
Gestures (-1): Hold shroud fragment over the target’s
head (simple)
Focused (+6): On target
Incantations (-2): “Dark force rising, protect thee from
the light.” (sentence)
Other Conditions (-3): Limited to those creatures physically harmed by exposure to sunlight or bright light;
only protects against light
Typically, this spell is used on vampires and demons. By
holding a fragment of a burial shroud over herself or another
being within a meter range, the caster creates an ethereal
shroud that protects the target from the damaging rays of
the sun. The shroud appears as a dark and filmy cape and
hood that covers the target’s entire body. As a result, the
target is nearly immune to the effects of normal sunlight
for a short time and might walk about unaffected, a valuable
boon for vampires.
At the time of casting, the mage can convert the result
points from the casting into a bonus to protection or duration. Convert the bonus points put into the effect into dice

and pips of Armor Value (three points per die; one point
per pip). Use the “Spell Measures” chart in the D6 Fantasy
or D6 Adventure rulebooks to determine the addition to the
duration in seconds.

Sight of Darkness
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light, darkness
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 9 (Infravision or Ultravision (R3), negates up to 6
points of modifiers for dim or dark conditions)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Flint and tinder (common)
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Focused (+6): On target
Incantations (-1): “See.” (phrase)
By the magic user sacrificing some of her life energy, she
grants a target with 24 hours of three ranks in Infravision
or Ultravision (which the caster chooses before casting the
spell). See the description of this Special Abilities in the
“Character Options” chapter for more details.

Sinister Pall
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 18 (+4D to intimidation)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-2): Scowl darkly and clench fists menacingly
(simple, offensive)
With a scowl and general menacing countenance, the
caster improves her intimidation skill for one minute. Her
features become shadowed and sinister, like the villain from
a horror movie. People are naturally unsettled by the casters appearance and therefore more prone to bending to the
force of his will.

Sniper Light Beam
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Light
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 18 (+4D to one targeting skill)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 3.5 seconds (-3)
Other Aspects:

Gestures (-2): Run trigger finger down the length of weapon
(fairly simple).
Other Conditions (-2): May only be used with a single
direct-fire, self-powered projectile weapon, such as a
crossbow or a gun
This spell creates a light beam that extends down the sights
of a projectile weapon, effectively serving as a sniper’s laser
sight. This improves the mage’s related ranged combat skill
when using that weapon for a period of one minute. This
bonus cannot be used with weapons that depend strength
for their power, such as bows or slings.

Stunt Plant
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness, Plant
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 5 (reduce movement difficulty modifiery by up to
-5)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 3.5 minutes (+12)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+10): 5-meter-radius circle
Countenance (-1): Caster takes on a gray pallor
Focused (+3): On caster
Gestures (-2): Spread hands in intended direction and lower
as if pressing down on something (fairly simple)
Incantations (-3): “Diminish, plants! Shrivel and die!”
(sentence, loud)
The caster literally presses back plant life before her,
diminishing or even killing them through the deprivation
of light. All plants require light to grow. The effect lasts for
three and a half minutes. Vegetation (grasses, briars, shrubs,
trees) within five meters of the caster shrink a quarter of its
normal size each round, becoming less bushy and entangling.
This allows for freer movement within the area of effect.
Assuming plants haven’t died completely, they begin to
slowly rejuvenate as soon as the spell is complete, growing
as per normal for the plant species in question. Trees may
take years or even decades to return to their previous state,
while grass may require only a few weeks.

Sun Scourge
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light, Fire
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 9 (Achilles’s Heel (R3), 5D damage and +20 to survival
and stamina difficulties in desert environments each day the
character is in the sun — values are not cumulative)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 week (+29)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components(-4): Ashes of creature desiccated by the sun
(uncommon)

Feedback (-2): -2 to damage resistance totals
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-2): Raise arms toward the sun and sprinkle the
ashes to the wind (fairly simple)
Incantations (-2): “Like a scythe, O mighty sun; cut down
thy enemies.” (sentence)
Other Conditions (-2) Can only be cast when the sun is
visible
The mage makes an offering of ashes to the sun and calls
upon its power, which she channels through her body. Then,
with a minimal amount of pain to herself and a simple
touch, the caster inflicts pain to an opponent as if he were
being burnt by the sun’s searing rays. It also makes him
unusually susceptible to the harsh effects of the sun. If the
victim opposes the touch —as most aware and able-bodied
beings would — the mage must make a successful brawling/
fighting attack.

Sun Cage
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light
Difficulty: 31
Effect: 37 (15 for resistance total of bars; negates up to 4D
of darkness modifier)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area of Effect (+15): Sphere with a radius of 3 meters
Gestures (-3): Mime escaping from a cell with eyes squinted
as if blinded by glaring light, then point at target (complex; acrobatics roll with difficulty of 11)
Unreal Effect (-10): Disbelief difficulty of 13
Light cage traps a target in a prison of magical sunlight.
After miming escaping from a cell and indicating the intended
target, the mage must make a marksmanship/firearms or apportation roll that beats the combat difficulty for the target.
If she succeeds, the target is trapped in a sphere with a radius
of three meters. (Creatures larger than that cannot be confined by this spell.) The cage glows radiantly, bright enough
to illuminate within one meter in all directions.
The result point bonus plus 15 serves as the damage resistance totals of the bars. The target can disbelieve and thus
free himself by generating a disbelief total of 13.

Turn to Shadow
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 33 (Intangibility (R1), +3D to damage resistance total
against physical attacks and movement is halved; Invisibility (R3), +3 to dodge, sneak/stealth, and hide: self totals and
+3 to search, tracking, investigation, and attack difficulties
against target)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)

Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 3.5 minutes (-12)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Dark clothes (very common)
Concentration (-1): 3 seconds with willpower/mettle difficulty of 7
Focused (+8): On target
Other Conditions (-1): Must be immersed in darkness or
shadow during casting time
To cast this spell, the mage must be wearing dark clothes
and devoid of any shiny objects that would catch and reflect
light. He must also be immersed in darkness or shadow at
the time of casting. The darkness need not be absolute; even
a shadowy corner of an inn’s common room is enough. When
the spell is cast, the mage transforms himself into a living
shadow. He has no mass and therefore makes no noise and
leaves no track of his passage, moves at half his normal rate,
may assume any general shape (though details are not possible), and may flow through tiny openings.
Because he is insubstantial, most physical attacks pass
right through the mage. However, he in turn cannot attack
in this form, nor can he speak or uses spells that require
biological conditions (incantations, for example, or handling
of material components).

Veil of Darkness
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk, Darkness
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 12 (+4D darkness modifier)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)
Other Aspects:
Countenance (-1): The mage looks drained, with dark
rings around eyes
Focused (+3): On target
Gestures (-2): Cover eyes with a hand, then a throwing
mostion at a target (fairly simple)
Incantations (-3): “You see NOTHING!” (sentence, loud)
The mage covers his eyes with a hand, drawing energy from
within himself, and then throws a ball of pure darkness at a
target. He must make a marksmanship/firearms or apportation roll to hit the target, and may throw the spell up to 10
meters distant. Hit targets find themselves blinded by a veil
of darkness that covers their eyes, imposing a +4D darkness
difficulty modifier on all relevant actions performed by this

creature for a period of 25 seconds. The bolt of darkness must
be fired in the same round that the mage casts the spell.

Vengeful Void
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Darkness, Water
Difficulty: 24
Effect: 45 (brawling/fighting of 4D; lifting/lift of 5D; 6D
physical damage)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 3 rounds (+6)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-1): Point at an intensely dark area (simple)
Incantations (-3): “Rise, darkness, and avenge me. I command it.” (sentence, loud)
Other Conditions (-3): A void of darkness in an otherwise
illuminated environment
To cast this spell, a void of darkness or dense shadow (such
as a deep pit, a nonilluminated dungeon room, or a shadowy
alley) must be present. The mage then shouts some words of
power and points toward the black spot. Through this spell,
the mage animates the darkness of the void into a tidal-wavelike mass that strikes down upon opponents with rage. The
darkness grabs an opponent within five meters brawling/fighting of 4D and inflicts 6D damage. Once captured, the target
is dragged back into the depths of the monster on the next
round, though the opponent may attempt to escape the void’s
lifting/lift of 5D. Those dragged into the void obviously must
contend with whatever dangers might lurk within (falling
damage from a pit, for example). Additionally, the darkness
inflicts its normal damage on the trapped creature. Creatures
trapped within the darkness feel as if they are drowning and
being crushed by the pressures of deep water.

Wall of Radiance
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Light
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 18 (negates up to -4D of darkness modifier; provides
+2D cover modifier)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 3.5 minutes (+12)

Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+6): Circle with radius of 3 meters
Components (-10): A handful of crystal shards (uncommon, destroyed); lit candle (very common)
Gestures (-2): Throw crystals into air and blow the flames
of a candle toward them (fairly simple)
The magic user throws a handful of crystal fragments in
the direction in which he wishes to create the wall of radiance. Then he blows the flames of a lit candle into the falling
shards. A shield-like wall of shimmering white light measuring
three meters in diameter appears at a distance of up to 10
meters from the caster.
The wall is immobile and remains in that position for three
and a half minutes. The light is so brilliant that it negates
up to 4D of darkness modifier within one meter. Its brightness provides a +2D cover modifier against anyone attacking
from the other side of the barrier. The wall does not offer
any physical barrier to attack or movement.

Do Not Disturb
A small, digest-sized book, this tome smells of mold
and the pages feel damp and cold. Anyone leafing
through the book finds the scent of decay transfers to
their fingers for the next 1D hours (resulting in a +1
difficulty modifier to relevant interactions rolls due to
the stench). Their fingers also feel numb with cold for
the same duration (+1 difficulty modifier for relevant
difficulties).
The book belonged to Theresa Silva, a Portuguese
nun who was seduced by the devil and subsequently
began delving into the dark arts. After she found this
tome, she locked herself in her quarters and secluded
herself. In her room, she died, still poring over this evil
tome. Some say she died of starvation; others avow it
was the book itself that killed her. In either event, it
was her obsession with the book and the secrets that
it contained that was Theresa’s undoing.
Contents: This flimsy spell book contains only a
few spells, all of which are have infernal names. These
include fear (“Song of Abigor”), scrying (“Vision of
Ahriman”), and sense past (“Balam’s Sign”) from the D6
Fantasy or D6 Adventure Rulebooks, as well as shroud of

darkness (“Vestments of the Order of the Fly”), shroud
of shade (“Shetan’s Shroud”), sinister pall (“Darkness
Embraced”), and Turn to Shadow (“Skin of Flauros, the
Black Leopard”).
Protection: Anyone who so much as reads a single
page of the book becomes obsessed with learning its
secrets. He’ll spend every available moment studying,
to the detriment of everything else in his life. At the
same time, he becomes extremely protective of it, sure
that everyone wants to take it from him or prevent him
from unlocking its mysteries. As a result, the reader
acquires paranoia and dependency (both rank 3 Quirks
— the character does not receive points for these).
Little does anyone know that, even in death, Theresa
remains jealously protective of the book. Her ghost is
tied to it, and she tries to feed the reader’s fears until
he destroys himself as she once did.
Reading Period/Difficulty: The spells recited in
the text are universally incorrect in minor but crucial
details. As a result, the reading period is extremely long
for such a small tome (13 weeks) and the languages/
reading/writing difficulty level is similarly high (15).

Difficulty: 13
Effect: 18 (+4D to willpower/mettle when bead used as planar
homing beacon)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:

Components (-2): Glass bead (very common)
Concentration (-6): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 12
Focused (+8): On glass bead
This spell serves little purpose on its own, but when used
in conjunction with the shift planes spell (or a similar spell),
it gives the caster +4D to her willpower/mettle roll when
attempting to return from another plane. The same magic
user must cast both spells, as the spells are attuned to her
senses.
So long as the glass bead remains in the originating
dimension, the bonus is granted to the caster. If the glass
bead is destroyed or shifted to another plane, then all trace
of it is lost.

determined, can be called upon with this spell. The effect’s
value plus the spell’s result point bonus is compared to a roll
of the target’s willpower/mettle (or the governing attribute) to
see if the spell successfully latches on. If it does, the beckoned
beast arrives instantly — and, if the caster can convince it,
to assist her in combat for the duration of the spell.

Bind Reality
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Dimension
Difficulty: 35
Effect: 27 (compare to spell total of dimension-hopping
spell)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 2.5 hours (-20)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+50): Sphere with radius of 10 meters

Concentration (-6): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 12
Gestures (-2): Make an encompassing gesture (fairly
simple)
Other Alterant (+1): Sphere glows when triggered
Other Conditions: (-5): Difficult scholar roll to recall information about the protected dimension
With this spell, a magic user can seal a 10-meter sphere,
preventing the opening or portals going to or coming from
other planes. Any caster or creature attempting to open a
gateway or shift into the affected area of this spell must
overcome the value of this spell’s effect. Any unsuccessful
attempt to get in or out warns the caster with a glow on the
sphere. This spell is useful when trying to prevent a prisoner
from escaping, or an unwanted entity from entering a given
location.

Blur Barriers
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Dimension
Difficulty: 33
Effect: 36 (+1D difficulty modifier to physical and mental
attributes)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 5 minutes (+13)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+20): Sphere with radius of 4 meters
Concentration (-3): 1 minute with willpower/mettle difficulty of 9
Gestures (-1): Wiggle fingers on one hand (simple)
For a short period of time, the magic user forms a nexus
of dimensions. If successful, the caster weakens the barriers,
resulting in nothing functioning as it normally does.The natural, physical laws of the occupied dimension become unstable.
Everyone within the area of effect is subject to an increase in
the difficultiles of all physical and mental actions.

Contact Entity
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: entity, dimension
Difficulty: 13
Effect: 61 (4D languages/speaking in the language of the
target entity; 49 compared to planar distance)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-3): 1 minute with willpower/mettle difficulty of 9
Other Conditions (-3): Must be knowledgeable of the entity
to be contacted, which requires a scholar roll of 11
Provided that the caster has some knowledge of the entity
or type of entity she wishes to contact, it’s possible to open a
channel to that being. If the spell is successful and the distance

to the entity’s location has a planar value of 49 or less, the
caster gains 4D languages in the language of the target. This
only lasts for the duration of the spell.
Contacting a creature from another plane does not guarantee that it is willing to communicate. Convincing it is left
to the caster.

Decrease Gravity
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: inanimate forces
Difficulty: 34
Effect: 30 (Hindrance: Low Gravity (R5), +5 to acrobatics,
brawling/fighting, and melee combat difficulties; Skill Bonus:
Low Gravity (R5), +5 to lifting/lift, running, and throwing
totals)
Range: 15 meters (+6)
Speed: Instantaneous (+6)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+25): Sphere with radius of 5 meters
Concentration (-2): 2 rounds of concentration with willpower/mettle difficulty of of 8
Gestures (-1): Clench fist and point (simple)
Incantations (-1): “Light.” (phrase)
At the indicated site, the caster decreases gravity for a
10-meter wide area. This causes certain physical actions to
receive modifiers to their difficulties or totals (see the “effect”
description for details).
As this is a magical adjustment in gravity, it does not affect
victims in exactly the same way as a normal loss of gravity.
Furthmore, anyone or anything leaving the area of effect
loses any modifiers given by the spell.

Dimensional Gap
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 41
Effect: 21 (7D physical damage)
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+50): Hemisphere with radius of 10 meters
Components (-1): Two rocks (ordinary)
Concentration (-3): 1 round with willpower/mettle at difficulty 9
Gestures (-2): Slam the components against each other
(fairly simple)
When the caster brings the components of the spell
together, the targeted location makes a dimensional gap in
the earth, creating a large hole in the ground. The shape is
spherical, thereby causing vehicle or creatures at the edge to
roll down the side into the center. Should the gap be created
directly beneath a creature, it drops straight down, suffering
7D damage. Damage to those who are not at ground zero

is reduced accordingly by the area effect rules discussed in
the “Magic” chapter of the D6 Adventure and D6 Fantasy
rulebooks.
When the hole disappears, anything that fell into the pit
is now in a heap on the mysteriously whole ground.

Dimensional Survival
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: dimension, folk
Difficulty: 26
Effect: 18 (Atmospheric Tolerance (R2); Environmental
Resistance (R2))
Range: Self or within 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+10): Circle with radius of 5 meters
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+8): On caster
Other Conditions (-4): Must be knowledgeable of the plane
in which the morphed characters are to travel, requiring
a scholar roll of 15
All who are affected by this spell are transformed physically so they can survive on a hostile dimension. Once the
spell is successfully cast, it operates upon all who are within
five meters of the mage, giving them half the ranks in the
Special Abilities as the caster. Anyone who leaves the circle
of influence loses the immunity and cannot regain it simply
by getting close the mage again.

Energy Barrier
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: inanimate forces
Difficulty: 30
Effect: 13 (Armor Value of 4D+1, physical only)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+40): Circle with radius of 20 meters
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 6
Gestures (-1): Point at the spot where the barrier is to be
formed (simple)
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
The mage can alter the forces that bind and form the
dimension in which she dwell, shifting them to her will.
By simply pointing and concentrating, the mage creates a
barrier providing 4D+1 protection from attacks. All beings
and objects behind the 20-meter area gain this advantage,
combining with existing armor. Of course, the limitation
to this spell is that the defense is 2 dimensional. Once cast,
barrier cannot be relocated or altered, allowing for opponents

to readily move around the side — providing they known
enough to do this.

Ethereal
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: dimensions
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 15 (Intangibility (R1), +3D to damage resistance total
against physical attacks and movement is halved)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 3 rounds (-6)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 6
Focused (+5): On target
When cast upon a character, the mage shifts the person
between dimensions, making them ethereal. The character
is visible, and still exists, but her being is spread among
many worlds. For the duration of this spell, she gains the
Intangibility (R1) Special Ability.

Erase Person
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 61
Effect: 88 (10D physical damage, ignore nonmagical armor;
up to 100 years in the past)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 100 years (+43)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-9): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 15
Focused (+26): On target
Other Conditions (-8): A roll of a 1 on the Wild Die in
the caster being erased, even if the difficulty number
was equaled or exceeded; may only be used once per
target
This deadly spell not only instantly kills the target, but also
obliterates her history from the universe. Upon contact with
the target, by means of a successful brawling/fighting roll, a
shroud of blackness envelops the victim, erasing her from
existence. As each person is linked through time and space,
the thread that formed her history is followed and destroyed.

This means that all memories, all written words, all history
is removed. It is as if the character had never existed. This
spell is not a charged spell. Only one opportunity to erase a
person is granted per casting of the spell, and that opportunity
occurs in the round after the spell’s completion.
As with powerful spells, there is the potential for disaster.
If the caster rolls a one on the Wild Die, it is the caster who
suffers the effect of the spell. Simply knowing this causes many
mages to shy away from attempting such powerful magic.

Far Walk
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 17
Effect: 26 (astral projection of 4D+1)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Feedback (-1): -1 to damage resistance total
Focused (+8): On caster
By sending her consciousness through the folds of interdimensional space, the caster can visit other locations by
leaving her body behind. This spell grants the caster 4D+1 in
the Psionics: astral projection skill (detailed in the “Psionics”
chapter of the D6 Adventure Rulebook).

Folded Space
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 15 (1,000 kilograms)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 week (+29)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Small chest or bag (very common)
Concentration (-3): Every 24 hours, spend 1 round in
concentration with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8 to
maintain the spell
Focused (+8): On container
A chest or bag with this spell cast upon it can hold up
to 1,000 kilograms of mass. The weight of the container is
not increased, as the objects drop into a fold within interdimensional space. However, it is not possible to sustain
living creatures within this area for more than a few minutes.
Nonetheless, it provides plenty of space for carrying items.
Note that any thing that is larger than the opening of the
container cannot be placed inside. This means an automobile
could not be shoved into a paper lunch bag, but 1,000 kilograms of marbles or appropriately sized items do fit.

Greater Telekinesis
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: inanimate forces
Difficulty: 27
Effect: 36 (telekinesis of 6D)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+10): On target
Successfully casting this spell imbues the target with the
Psionics skill telekinesis at 6D. The target is can move objects
with the power of her mind. All the rules for the skill use
apply as dictated in the D6 Adventure Rulebook chapter on
“Psionics.” The distance moved and weight of an object moved
is indicated on the “Telekinesis” table. The “Psionics Range”
table governs the range of the telekinesis skill.

Increase Gravity
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: inanimate forces
Difficulty: 34
Effect: 30 (Hindrance: High Gravity (R10), +5 to acrobatics, brawling/fighting, lifting/lift, melee combat, running, and
throwing difficulties)
Range: 15 meters (+6)
Speed: Instantaneous (+6)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+25): Sphere with radius of 5 meters
Concentration (-2): 2 rounds of concentration with willpower/mettle difficulty of of 8
Gestures (-1): Clench fist and point (simple)
Incantations (-1): “Heavy.” (phrase)
The caster increases gravity for a 10-meter wide area.
Because of this, certain physical actions get difficulty modifiers (see the “effect” description for details).
As this is a magical adjustment in gravity, it does not affect
victims in exactly the same way as a normal loss of gravity.
Furthmore, anyone or anything leaving the area of effect
loses any modifiers given by the spell.

Lesser Telekinesis
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: inanimate forces
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 18 (telekinesis of 3D)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 25 minutes (+16)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:

Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+6): On target
The target can move objects with the power her mind with
the successful casting of this spell. The “Psionics” chapter in
the D6 Adventure Rulebook describes the game mechanics of
this spell. The distance moved and weight of an object moved
is indicated on the “Telekinesis” table. The “Psionics Range”
table governs the range of the telekinesis skill.

Locate Person
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: dimension, folk
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 6 (search of 2D)
Range: 10 kilometers (+20)
Speed: Instantaneous (+20)
Duration: 1 minute (+4)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): Personal belonging from target (very
rare)
Concentration (-2): 3 rounds with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Gestures (-2): Form goggles with hands over eyes (fairly
simple)
Variable Movement (+5): Bending/unseen target
If all the conditions are satisfied, then it is possible for
the caster to locate a given person within a 10-kilometer
range. Compare the result points of the spell’s search versus
the target’s Agility/Reflexes or sneak/stealth to the following
table to find how much the mage knows.
Minimal (0 or less): general direction is determined
Solid (1–4): direction and an idea of distance are known
Good (5–8): direction, rough distance, and general features
of the location are discerned
Superior (9 or more): direction, exact distance, and the
exact location are garnered

Rend Reality
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 29
Effect: 30 (10D physical damage)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+15): Sphere with radius of 3 meters
Components (-2): 2 small magnets (very common)
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Gestures (-2): Tearing motion with hands while holding
magnets (fairly simple)

After casting this powerful spell, the fabric of reality is
torn asunder, leaving a gapping tear that is jet black. This is
the space between spaces, an utter void. All who are within
the area effect of this spell must make an opposed Physique/
Strength or lifting/lift roll against the spell skill total (no other
targeting roll is needed). Failure results in being pulled inside.
Those who lose all of their Body Points or Wounds from the
damage caused by the rift are lost forever; it is impossible to
pull an object or a person from this temporarily disrupted
section of the universe. Anyone surviving the devestation
is found after the spell wears off, battered, on the ground
where the tear once was.

Secret Passage
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 10
Effect: 16 (move up to 150 kilograms per round 10 meters
away)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-1): Outline circle in the air (simple)
Casting secret passage opens an interdimensional gateway
with an opening within one meter of the caster and an exit
10 meters away. The exit portal connects as though a straight
line were drawn from one point to another. This allows passage through 10 meters of any material, including air, water,
rock, and so on. All who enter vanish from sight and instantly
appear at the exit point.

Send Whisper
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 0
Range: 1 kilometer (+15)
Speed: Instantaneous (+15)
Duration: 2 rounds (+5)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Gestures (-1): Make a cone with hands around mouth
(simple)
Incantations (-2): Whisper target’s name along with the
desired message (complex; languages/speaking roll with
difficulty of 11)
Other Conditions (-2): Must have known the target for at
least 1 week; must speak target’s language
Only the target can hear the caster’s words if the spell
is successful. The communication is one-way, coming from
the caster. But because the message is traveling through
the barrier between planes, voices often become distorted,

making sending a message much more difficult than normal
conversation. For this reason, the magic user must make a
languages/speaking attempt in a language the caster speaks
and the target understands. The distortion creating by sending
a dimensional message creates a difficulty of 11. If the skill
roll succeeds, the message is automatically heard. If a one is
rolled on the Wild Die, but the difficulty number is equaled
or passed, then others within one-meter of the target can
hear the message as well.
The message is limited to what the caster can say in 10
seconds.

Transgressing Boundaries
While no one is particularly sure where this book
originated, it has been duplicated many times over.
Some of the copies have translation mistakes, while
others are completely erroneous. Being reproduced so
many times makes it unlikely that a player’s character
can encounter an original.
As the tome has survived over countless centuries,
and seen existence on countless planes, it is not surprising that once electronic editions came into being, the
title became well known, but the integrity decreased.
Nonetheless, discerning a fake requires a forgery roll
of 13. If a hero possesses a forged edition but believes
it to be authentic, then it likely that some of the spells
have been intentionally corrupted. The number of the
corrupted spells is left to the gamemaster to determine.
The possibility of owning a “fake” copy is not a secret to
those who have heard of the volume. Most are willing
to take the risk.
The gamemaster must decide upon the physical form
the text takes, based upon her game setting. It certainly
can range from handwritten to a digital edition.
Contents: Most every version of Transgressing
Boundaries has detailed information about the arcane
knowledge dimensions. If it is allowed, a player’s character can improve or gain knowledge in this area, provided
the proper reading period is dedicated to the volume.
(The player must also spend the requisite Character
Points for obtaining a Special Ability.)
Also contained in the text are the following spells:
secret passage, locate person, vanish, shift plane, beacon
and possibly others.
Protections: Some electronic editions contain a
virus that imparts a Hindrance on the user’s computer skills (Hindrance (R4), +3 to all computer-using
actions).
Language: Because the text has been translated
myriad times, by numerous species spanning multiple
planes, it is likely that the tome is available in nearly
any language.
Reading Period: The reader needs eight months to
fully study the material. While partial study provides

general information about the topic, a complete and
thorough reading is necessary to gain the Arcane
Knowledge Special Ability. Additionally, until the full
study period has passed, all attempts to cast a spell
from the text fail. For every two months of study, an
Easy investigation is required. Succeeding at the roll
indicates that the past two months were meaningful.
Failure means that the person must reread portions
and is delayed by two months.
After a total of eight successful month have been
acquired, the reader fully comprehends the text.

Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+25): Sphere with radius of 5 meters
Concentration (-5): 10 minutes with willpower/mettle

Gestures (-1): Touch the ground upon the completion of

Incantations (-1): “Shift.” (phrase)
Other Conditions (-6): Must be knowledgeable of the target
dimension, which requires a scholar roll of 20
Upt to 600 kilograms of targets within the spell’s radius
are transported to a given dimension. As this spell uses an
area effect, the caster may not choose the targets going
with him.

Synchronicity
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 13
Effect: 4 (5 kilograms)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 5 rounds (+6)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+2): On target
Gestures (-1): Grasp at air (simple)

Incantations (-2): Whisper, “I touch something from afar.”
(sentence)
Variable Movement (+5): Bending/unseen target
Other Conditions: (-2): Must make a scholar roll at 11, indicating she has sufficient understanding of dimensions
Many occultists and scholars of magic believe that there
is no such thing as coincidence. Instead, seemingly random
events are attributed to interference from other dimensions,
or an object coming out of a dimension and then re-entering
the same dimension at another location. That is to say, if the
top of a horseshoe where to be pushed through a sheet of
paper to the point that only the open ends were visible, those
unfamiliar with the shape of the horseshoe would see two,
separate items poking through the paper. But to those who
understand the shape of a horseshoe, it is known that both
visible parts are connected by an unseen bend. This is how
synchronicity works. It allows the caster to perform an action,
but that action is linked through a multi-dimensional conduit
that causes a similar action to occur at a distance.
After completing the spell, the magic user’s physical actions
are invisibly replicated at a spot of her choosing up to 100
meters away. Once the location is designated, it cannot be
altered. For instance, the mage may decide that when she
waves her hands, the glassware in a shop 50 meters away
would suddenly clatter to the floor, though it would not
break as this spell causes no damage.
The exact results are left to the gamemaster and the circumstances, but the caster should be allowed to be as creative as
possible. (However, this spell cannot cause injury — though
perhaps a little pain, such as a tug on the ear — and can
only affect up to five kilograms of matter.) Because of this
unique ability, this spell is often used to distract others for
a brief moment.

Unseen Bullet
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 0 (1 kilogram projectile)
Range: 150 meters (+11)
Speed: Instantaneous (+11)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): physical projectile of any sort, be it rock,
arrow, bullet, etc. (ordinary)
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+1): On projectile
Gestures (-1): Grasp projectile in hand (simple)
Variable Movement (+5): Bending with +4D (+12) to
targeting skill total
Without the ability to see or sense the target, such as
through other magic, this spell is not very useful. If a victim
can be located, then the projectile can be thrown or fired
with a +4D (+12) to the targeting skill total. The object hits

the target on a successful skill roll as though appearing from
no where. There is no possibility to dodge or take cover, as
projectile travels through a wormhole, unhindered by all
physical barriers. This means it is possible to shoot through
one or more windows without breaking the glass.

mental attacks against character; Natural Armor: In Other
Dimension (R3), +3D to damage resistance roll against physical and energy attacks)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Other Conditions (-2): Anything that affects other dimensional creatures affects the target
Any living or nonliving item up to 150 kilograms can be
folded into a small, temporary dimension created by the
caster. By all appearances, the object or person simply vanishes from sight. Time passes normally for the duration of
the spell; the target can do whatever she wishes, as long as
she does not move from the spot where she vanished. There
is always enough air to breath for at least one hour. The
atmosphere must be present at the location where the spell
is cast; it cannot be created by the magic user.

Void Shield
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: dimension
Difficulty: 29
Effect: 23 (5D physical damage, ignores nonmagical
armor)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Change Target (+25): up to 5 times (once per round or
when attacked)
Gestures (-2): draw circle in the air (simple)
Other Conditions (-5): Willpower/mettle roll of 14 is
required each time the spell is moved; target must be
alive
Casting void shield creates a one-meter radius circle of
negative energy that causes 5D damage to up to five targets
that come in contact with it. Its name is misleading in that
it doesn’t improve Armor Value; rather, it is a weapon. While

the spell is active, the “shield” thrums, as the caster directs it
from target to target. It is only capable of causing damage to
those who possess positive energy, who are alive. It can pass
through a character, causing damage, moving to the next to
continue with another attack.
Striking at the void shield is the as being attack. The attacking weapon and the attacker suffer 5D of damage, split
between them (but only one of the change targets is used
up). Nonmagical armor does not protect against the damage
caused by this spell.

Vortex
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: dimensions
Difficulty: 34
Effect: 29 (6D+1 physical damage, ignores nonmagical
armor)
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)
Duration: 3 rounds (+6)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+25): Sphere with radius of 5 meters
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Variable Movement (+1): Movement of 5 meters per
round
By knowledge of the planes and will, a mage can focus
her mental energy upon a location visible to her and open
a swirling vortex. This is an interdimensional juncture that
creates havoc in nearly any plane it is created. The opening
of the shimmering vortex is announced by a deep rumbling
sound not unlike thunder. By the time the spell is completed,
all within several meters can hear and feel the roar and quake
of this unnatural creation. Any object that comes into contact
with it suffers 6D+1 damage, with no damage being absorbed
by nonmagical armor. Additionally, the caster can move the
vortex five meter per round.
Should two vortices come into contact, they cancel each
other, immediately ending the spell.

Arcane Knowledge: inanimate forces, enchanted, metal
Difficulty: 15/17

minimum of 1 meter per round)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:

Components (-6/-3): Robot/automaton without power
source (extremely rare/common)
Focused (+10): On target
Gestures (-6): Program instructions into robot (challenging, devices/tech/robot interface/repair difficulty of 23)
Incantations (-2): “Activate!” loudly (phrase)
The game setting determines the components modifier.
In fantasy or pre-computer eras, robots are likely to be
extremely rare, while post-computer or science fiction settings often have an abundance of robots. In any case, this
spell does not give life to a machine. Rather, it imbues 3D to
both Agility/Reflexes and Physique/Strength. This means that
the mechanical device is capable of ambulation (at a rate of
and physical acts such as lifting or attacking. However, to
control the device requires programming with the devices/
tech/robot interface/repair skill. Instructions cannot be called
out, as the automaton or robot has not been given the ability
to understand speech. Automatons make useful guards and
servants, and are occasionally handy in combat.

Difficulty: 21
Effect: 12 (Hindrance: Altered Firearm (R4), +12 to marksmanship/firearms difficulties)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): Small, misshapen lead ball (common)
Focused (+5): On weapon
Gestures (-1): Make spiral motion with hand (simple)
Other Conditions (-1): The target must be a ranged weapon
that is manufactured of metal or has a metal component
as part of its firing mechanism
With the twist of a hand, the magic user can cause a ranged
weapon to alter the interior shape of its barrel, bore, rifling and
so on. Although the imperfection created is minor, requiring
a Moderate search to detect, it is sufficient to create a +12
difficulty modifier to marksmanship/firearms.

Armor
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Metal
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 6 (Armor Value of 2D, physical only)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Any type of coin-sized metal: bronze,
iron, and so on (very common)
Focused (+4): On coin

Incantations (-1): “Make armor!.” (phrase)
This spell allows the caster to produce the equivalent of a
breastplate and grieves from a coin-sized fragment of metal.
This not only works wonderfully when passing through
metal detectors, but just as well when entering a monarch’s
sanctuary. Regardless of the type of metal used, the armor
is similar to bronze armor in quality and protection. Once
it is conjured on a target, it cannot be removed unless the
spell duration ends or the magic user halts it. The armor is
seamless, and fits any form perfectly.

Attract Metal
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 18 (Hindrance: Metal Attracts (R), -6 to damage
resistance total)
Range: 10 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Small magnet or loadstone (ordinary)
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Coutenance (-1): Target surrounded by faint red glow
Focused (+5): On target
Gestures (-1): Wave hand, welcoming something (simple)
Other Conditions (-1): Hindrance only applies to attacks
made by metal weapons or spells using metal
If the mage successfully casts this spell, then the victim
attracts metal weapons, increasing their damage by pulling
them toward the character. The spell is not capable of automatically causing damage; rather, it decreases the protection
offered against any melee or magical or projectile weapons
used against the target. For the duration of the spell, the
figure is surrounded by a faint red glow. The effect of this
spell is not limited to ferrous metals.

Awaken Machine
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Inanimate Forces
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 18 (one combat skill of 3D; +2D physical damage)
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): A mechanical device that has a weapon
(very rare)
Concentration (-2): 1 hour with willpower/mettle difficulty
of 12
Incantations (-1): “Tick! (phrase)
Other Alterants (+3): Will attack anything that moves
within 3 meters of it

The spell only activates any weapon mounted upon the
machine, conveying 3D in one combat skill (chosen at casting with +2D to its weapon’s damage. The weapon used
determines the amount of damage.
Even though the device may have legs, tracks or another
form of locomotion, the spell does not cause it to move.
The contraption is incapable of thought. But, through magic
and mechanical gimmickry, once awakened, it fights with
the skill of a moderately trained warrior. Often such devices
are place in corridors for protection, or hidden beneath false
floors as a trap.

Construct Small Automaton
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Inanimate Forces
Difficulty: 36
Effect: 52 (8D in device skill, 6D in craft skill, and 10 materials)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 year (+38)
Casting Time: 1 week (-29)
Other Aspects:
Components (-7): A variety of materials are needed, ranging
from the mundane to a flawless gem or some other such rare
item to energize the automaton (uncommon to rare)
Focused (+18): On target
Incantations (-1): “Understand.” whispered (phrase)
The game setting determines the components needed. The
automaton is usually a mechanical contraption of limited
capability. Typically such machines do not possess the faculty of cognitive thought. Instead, they are controlled by
spells such as Activate Automaton, which allow for limited
function. However, the first step is constructing the device.
A successful casting of this spell allows for the construction
of a human sized creation. The gamemaster should have the
player’s characters follow the rules for the skill device, and
possibly make some of the require components very difficult
to acquire — having a world populated by automatons can
be interested and dangerous.

The first step is developing the blue prints This is done
by achieving using the table for Complexity of Device in
“Example Skill Difficulties” chapter. The gamemaster must
decide upon the technological level of the culture. In most
cases, an automaton is as prototype (+10) and is from a much
higher culture (+10), resulting in a minimum +20 modifier.
With research, this modifier might be altered. Each roll takes
one month. The base difficulty for drawing up the blueprints
is Very Difficult. However, the gamemaster should count
previous failures as bonus modifiers, as the hero learns from
her mistakes.
After the blueprints have been created, the construction
commences. Now the crafting skill is used to construct the
automaton. Again, the related table from the “Example
Skill Difficulties” chapter should be used. The number of
components that have been gathered, their quality and the
clarity of the blueprints determine the modifiers used for
constructing an automaton. The base difficulty is Very Difficult. Each attempt to construct the device takes 2 months.
The gamemaster should consider previous failures as bonus
modifiers for future attempts.
At the end of the spell’s duration, the skills are lost, but the
knowledge is not. If the attempt to build an automaton was
not successful, then the gamemaster should apply bonuses
for the next attempt for gained experience.

Speed: instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 2 year (+39)
Casting Time: 1 week (-29)
Other Aspects:
Components (-7): A variety of materials are needed, ranging
from the mundane to a flawless gem or some other such rare
item to energize the automaton (uncommon to rare)
Focused (+20): On target
Incantations (-1): “Understand.” whispered (phrase)
Other Conditions (-6): Large quantities and cumbersome
materials, tools and devices are needed, as well as funding; additionally, a large location is needed to construct
monstrous creation
This spell work identically to Construct Small Automaton See
that spell for specifics. Note the differences are in size, casting
difficulty and duration. Blueprint design and construction
times are doubled. Otherwise, all other aspects apply.
Other Conditions: (-1) Must be a metal, edged, nonmagical weapon
This spell dulls a weapons edge. When successfully cast,
the weapon has a -2D damage modifier, with a minimum

adjusted damage value for the weapon of +1D. Any blade that
is blunted to +1D becomes something akin to a metal stick.
Magic weapons are not affected by this spell.

Effect: 18 (Skill Bonus (R6), +18 to devices/tech/robot (or
computer) interface/repair totals)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 4 rounds (-6)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Wire or similar piece of metal (ordinary)
Focused (+7): On target
Other Conditions (-1): The target must be able to touch
the device or connect to it electronically
If the caster uses this spell in a setting without the electronic networks, then the machine must be within reach of
the target. A successful casting provides the target with a +18
to her devices/tech/robot (or computer) interface/repair totals.
The setting and the devices that the caster intends the target
to affect dictate the skill that gets the bonus.

Corrosive Cloud
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Metal
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 15 (5D physical damage to metal, while living creatures lose one action if fail resistance roll)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+5): Sphere with radius of 1 meter
Components (-2): Small vile of acidic liquid, such as juice
from a lemon or lime (very common)
Gestures (-1): Point in direction of cloud location (simple)
Incantations (-2): Repeated phrase for duration of spell
(sentence)
Casting this spell creates as green haze. All metal within it
suffers 5D of corrosive damage unless magically protected.
The cloud is so dense as to require any living creatures inside
to make a Moderate Physique/Strength or stamina roll. Failure
results in choking (and the targets lose their next action).
Each round the cloud remains over a metal target, it suffers
an additional 5D of damage until it is destroyed
For the duration of the spell, the caster must continue the
litany that invokes the mystical cloud.

Discern Alloy
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Metal
Difficulty: 12
Effect: 24 (Skill Bonus (R8), +24 to investigation totals for
purposes of determining metal)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-1): Move hands across the object (simple)
Even if the caster has no knowledge of various metals and
alloys, this spell allows her to perceive what was used to make
a given object. This is useful when encountering strange alien
objects or when attempting to see how strong a weapon, door,
or similar item is. Upon successfully casting discern alloy, the
magic user gains a +24 bonus to her investigation totals in
order to figure out the type of metal used. The difficulty is
determined by the gamemaster.

Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+25): Sphere with 5 meter radius
Components (-1): Small magnet or loadstone (ordinary)
Incantations (-2): “Pulse!” (phrase, loud)
Other conditions (-2): Only affects electrical devices
Any electronic equipment in the area effect of this spell
suffers 10D damage from an electro-magnetic pulse. As this
effect is caused by altering the inanimate forces of nature,
instead of exploding a bomb, there is no damage done to most
living beings or to devices that do not have electronics.

Incantations (-1): “Flawless.” (phrase)
Other Conditions (-1): Must possess some experience in
the affected skill
To gain the bonus from a successful casting of this spell,
the target must have some training in crafting/repair/personal
equipment repair; otherwise, the magical knowledge is lost.
In order for a perfect weapon to be properly crafted, not
only are the raw materials, forge, and ancillary equipment
needed, but a crafting/repair/personal equipment repair roll
with a difficulty of Heroic is required to forge the item. The
gamemaster may use the result points from the forging skill
roll to give bonuses to the superior pieces of equipment.

Other Aspects:
Components (-3): Whetstone (common)
Countenance (-1): Weapon gains faint blue shine
Focused (+6): On weapon
Gestures (-2): Move whetstone as though sharpening a
weapon (fairly simple)
Incantations (-3): “I whet your blunt purpose!” (sentence,
loud)
Other Conditions (-1): Only works on a nonmagical, metal,
edged weapon
This spell places a magically keen edge upon a weapon,
increasing its damage by +2D+2. Any weapon with this spell
cast upon it gains a faint blue shine to its surface, as the
magic reshapes the metal to the molecular level, honing the
blade’s edge to that of a single atom. For the duration of this
spell, there is no material that cannot be cut or damaged by
the magical edge, even though normal or magical protection
might hinder damage.

Locate Metal
Skill: Divination

Difficulty: 18
Effect: 12 (search of 4D to detect a single type of metal)
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:

Area Effect (+9): Divination sphere with radius of 3.5
meters
Component (-1): Forked stick (ordinary)
Concentration (-4): 1 minute with willpower/mettle of
10
Incantations (-1): Name of the metal (phrase)
Variable Movement (+5): Bending/unseen target
Once the metal is named, the spell is complete. Immediately,
the mage can roll search at 4D to locate the prescribed metal
inside an item, the earth, or a living being. Sometimes this
spell is used to locate trace amounts of a particular metal,
such as mercury or uranium. If there is anything of interest
in the indicated area, a luminous yellow glow surrounds the
location of the metal for up to one minute. The brilliance is
determined by the quantity or density of the metal in searched
for. The higher the search total is above the difficulty, the more
information the caster gleans from her attempt, including
location, depth, quantity, etc. The gamemaster decides on the
difficulty, which depends on how well hidden the material is
and how much is there.

Machine Terror

machine capable of stimulating terror in anyone within sight
of the device. Anyone who fails an opposed interaction roll
against the machine’s intimdation loses her next action. The
machine terrorizes once per round for the duration of the
spell. This is a way of making a trap, automaton, robot, and
so on appear far more frightening than it may actually be.

The caster transforms a coin into a floating platter capable
of carrying 100 kilograms of weight. To direct it, all that needs
to be done is to point. If the magic user indicates herself, then
the tray follows her. Otherwise, she must guide it. Providing
a character is 100 kilograms or less, it is possible for her to
ride or be carried by the platter.

Incantations (-1): “Pull!.” (phrase, loud)
Other Alterants (+8): Metal objects move toward magnet
at rate of 1 meter per round; mechanical devices within
spell’s influence stop working for duration of spell
Once cast, this spell is not very discerning: All ferrous
objects within its radius are pulled toward the loadstone. The
magic user throws the stone in a direction that works best
against any enemy, making sure to stay clear herself. Anyone
wearing metal must make a Physique/Strength or lifting/lift
against the effect’s difficulty. Failure means the affected object
is yanked free and pulled toward the loadstone at a speed of
one meter per round. If ferrous armor is being worn, then the
character wearing the armor moves as well. (Non-character
objects automatically move toward the stone.)
Another effect this spell has is to cause all mechanical
devices with metals influenced by magnetism to stop functioning, as well as being pulled toward the loadstone.

De Magnete
Written by Silas Copi, a philosopher of natural and
unnatural laws, De Magnete spans 400 pages. It is a collection of folklore and histories as much as an original
work. Much of its contents are likely to have existed
throughout human history in many forms. Copi himself
discusses one source, Earthly Bodies, that served as the
basis of his fundamental research.

De Magnete was published in the 1600s, and Copi
gives no date for his primary sources. Copi’s edition of
De Magnete is often mistaken with a similar work by an
English author named William Gilbert. Some historians have speculated that there might be a connection
between the two works, and that Gilbert published a
second version of his text covertly to avoid royal censors and papal punishment.
Contents: In addition to numerous other spells hidden throughout the document, the basic spells include:
alter trajectory, awaken machine, blunt, malfunction,
metal storm, and molting metal.
Protections: None.
Language: The tome is written in a common language of the gamemasters’s choosing. However, it does
require the reader be skilled in the Extranormal art of
Magic. With prolonged study, such a success allows the
reader to understand the nature of the text.
Reading Period: It takes two months to read and
comprehend the book. Each month, a successful Difficult skill roll in any of the Magic skills is required to
decipher the script, symbols, and arcane terminology.
After studying the tome, it is possible to start learning
the spells at a rate of one per day.

Gestures (-2): Throw component in direction of target

Incantations (-2): “Stop!” loudly (phrase)
Other Conditions (-1): Only harms mechanical devices
Sometimes it is best to fight metal with metal. When cast,
this spell sends a searing bolt of energy at the target, doing
6D damage. This spell has only works against machines, as it
uses the same forces of physics (and sometimes magic) that
produced the construct to destroy it. No harm comes to a
living, undead, or any other creature that is not mechanical
in nature. Certainly robots are affected by this spell, as are
cyborgs. However, only the mechanical parts of a cyborg are
damaged; the living flesh is unharmed.

Gestures (-1): Point at target with statue (simple)
Incantations (-2): “Statue!.” (phrase, loud)
Other Alterant (+3): Target turns into a statue if she
dies
A mage who successfully casts this spell and makes the
necessary targeting roll causes 12D damage that nonmagical armor offers no protection against. The spell alters the
composition of the target, attempting to refigure her into
an iron statue. If the damage is sufficient to cause death,
then she becomes a statue. This is permanent damage. The
character cannot be resurrected, as there is no living material
to bring back to life. Instead, she has become an ornament
for someone’s garden or great hall.

Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Malleable clay (very common)
Concentration (-2): 2 rounds with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Gestures (-2): Shape the clay (fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): “Alter.” (phrase)
Other Conditions: (-1) The target must be nonmagical,
metal, and no more than 5 kilograms
Any targeted metal object that has a mass of five kilograms
or less can be permanently altered in shape. For instance, the
caster could transform a shield into a ball, thereby negating
its protection. Or, the length of a metal rod could be extended
to twice its length, although doing this makes it very thin.
Just as easily could the barrel of a gun be twisted closed.
Basically, whatever shape the magic user makes with the clay
component is paralleled with the target. (The player specifies the target and the shape, and the gamemaster compares
the effect’s value plus the casting’s result point bonus to the
object’s Toughness or damage resistance to determine whether
the object takes the new shape.) Magically imbued metal or
magically protected metal cannot be altered.

Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): Powdered bronze (uncommon,
destroyed)
Focused (+9): On target
Gestures (-1): Sprinkle powdered bronze over target
(simple)
Other Conditions (-2): Deteriorates when exposed to
moisture
Though bronze can be a fairly precious commodity, the
value of this spell is well worth the expense. After simply
sprinkling a handful of powdered bronze over a sentient
target, the mage coats that individual’s skin in a thin layer
of bronze that doesn’t hamper movement. It’s a strong as
the actual metal, offering an Armor Value of 2D against all
types of physical (not mental) attacks. In addition, because
of its rich, attractive coloration, the bronzed skin provides
a charm/persuasion skill bonus of +2D. The spell lasts for one
hour, expect in moist environments where a greenish patina
quickly forms and causes the spell to deteriorate rapidly.
In humid or damp environments (jungles or dungeons, for
example), the spell deteriorates at a rate of five minutes for
every one minute of exposure. In water, the rate is 10 minutes
per minute of exposure.

Incantations (-2): “Grow claws!.” (phrase, loud)
Other Conditions (-1): Target must hold coins in each
hand
Once cast, three metal blades extend from each hand of the
target. As these weapons are natural extensions of the character, she uses brawling to fight with them. Each confers +2D

Countenance (-2): Target appears metallic
Focused (+8): On target
Incantations (-2): “I give you flesh of metal.” (sentence)
Other Conditions (-1): Cannot be combined with any
other armor
This highly coveted spell transforms fleshy skin into a
nearly impenetrable metal husk. It protects against normal
and magical attacks. As the transmuted skin is as malleable
as human flesh, at least to the target, there are no penalties
from this spell. However, it is not easily disguised as any
character who has had metal flesh cast upon her is shiny and
rings if tapped with any solid object.
It cannot be combined with any other armor, and the
target cannot wear any form of metal armor when the spell

Other Conditions (-1): Affects ferrous metal only
The mage produces a 25-meter radius downpour of red
rain that rusts all ferrous metal. When cast, the mage simply
indicates the location of the deluge by pointing, and the area
is drenched with oxidizing water, causing 5Ddamage to all
ferrous metal in the affected area. It is possible to protect
items by wrapping them in cloth, skins, or plastic or locking
them in waterproof cases. Likewise, vehicles within the area
suffer immediate damage, starting from the outside and
working to the interior.

Gestures (-1): Swing hand in a downward motion (simple)
Other Conditions (-1): Can only be cast in an open portal
The mage stands within a meter of an opening and projects
the spell upward. After the spell is cast, over the course of a
round, an iron portcullis comes into existence. Its eventually
spans up to three meters high and a meter wide.
Because the magical barrier is slow moving, it is possible
to be captured beneath it as it slides to the ground. Any
unfortunate character in this situation suffers 5D damage
from the portcullis each round that she is trapped beneath its
unrelenting grip. Unless the character is killed, this prevents
the portal from being completely blocked.
Once closed, the gate has a damage resistance totoal of
30.

Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)

Rain of Rust

Repel Metal
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Inanimate Forces
Difficulty: 13
Effect: 10 (Armor Value of 3D+1, physical only)
Range: 10 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 1 hour (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Small magnet or loadstone (ordinary)
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Countenance (-1): Target surrounded by faint blue glow
Focused (+3): On target
Gestures (-1): Wave hand as though to push aside something (simple)
Other Conditions (-1): Only works against damage caused
by metal
All attacks made by weapons of metal are affected by this
spell. The mage casts it upon a target, providing a 3D+1
Armor Value against any attack that uses metal to damage.
For example, this spell offers protection against the spell
metal storm, as the projectiles are metallic. For the dura-

tion of the spell, the protected character is surrounded by
a faint blue glow. The effects of this spell are not limited to
ferrous metals.

Understand Inner Workings
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Inanimate forces
Difficulty: 22
Effect: 17 (5D+2 in appropriate skill, such as tech, devices,
etc.)
Range: Touch (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+8): On target
Gestures (-1): Touch machine and target (simple)
Incantations (-2): “Comprehend the secrets of this
machine.” (sentence)
Understanding of complex, alien, or arcane technologies
can be gained by casting this spell. (The gamemaster detemines
the difficulty of understanding the machine, with the result
points from the skill conferred by the spell used to determine
what information the character gains.) Unfortunately, this
knowledge lasts only as long as the spell endures. Once the
magic has elapsed, all comprehension of the technology
vanishes as well.

Understand Vehicle
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Inanimate forces
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 12 (4D in appropriate skill for operating a specified
vehicle)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-1): Touch machine and target (simple)
Incantations (-2): “Comprehend the secrets of this vehicle.”
(sentence)
A mage can grant the knowledge to pilot a vehicle at a 4D
ability with this spell. No protections or great insights are
provided, just the minimal knowledge necessary to operate
the vehicle. Should it malfunction or fail, the target does not
have the knowledge to repair the mechanical device, unless
that knowledge existed otherwise. This spell does not enhance
an existing skill; it confers a new skill.

Wizardry
Alter Shape
Skill: Conjuration

Arcane Knowledge: Enchanted
Difficulty: 47
Effect: 60 (Shapeshifting (R1), form of caster’s choosing,
with Restricted (R2), ability uncontrolled by target; plus up
to 19 points — not ranks — of related Special Abilities, with
additional ranks in a Special Ability equalling the point cost
of the first rank)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Charged (+5): 1 improved charge, memorized by caster
Components (-2): Clay and stone (very common)
Focused (+17): On target
Gestures (-2): Shape clay into rough version of desired
form (fairly simple)
This spell changes the physical form of the target. For all
intentions, the character becomes the creature. However,
he maintains his disposition to friends and enemies, and
has a vague sense of identity. Additionally, while he might
not be able to directly communicate, he can understand
basic instructions, and respond with sounds, gestures, or
movements.

Befriend Animal
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Enchanted
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 18 (animal handling of 6D; use persuasion: animals
in D6 Space)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Shiny trinket (ordinary)
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-1): Swing or move trinket back and forth
(simple)
Incantations (-1): Soothing sounds (phrase)
Sometimes a canny mage can turn a bad situation into a
good one. In this case, by using the 6D in animal handling
(persuasion: animals in D6 Space) granted by the spell, the
character could befriend creatures, hostile or otherwise.
The spell’s target makes an opposed difficulty roll against a
creature’s willpower/mettle (or the governing attribute) plus
5. If successful, an unfriendly creature can be converted into
an ally — one that fights for the caster. Any attack against
the creature by the caster or one of her allies immediately
ends the spell.

Blur
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 13

Effect: 9 (Blur (R1), +1 to dodge, sneak/stealth, and hide: self
totals, plus +1 to default search, tracking, investigation, and
attack difficulties against character)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Strip of cloth (ordinary); bit of glass
(ordinary
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Focused (+4): On target
Gestures (-2): Polish glass with cloth (fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): “Blur.” (phrase)
By sacrificing some of her life energy, the mage grants
a target 10 minutes of the bonus given by the Blur Special
Ability at rank 1. See the description of this Special Ability in
the “Character Options” chapter for additional details.

Change Material
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 4 (5 kilograms)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Feedback (-1): -1 to damage resistance total
Focused (+5): On target
Incantations (-2): “You will become...” followed by new
material’s name (sentence)
Other Alterants (+9): Transmute to new form
Other Conditions (-1): Simple, inanimate material only
This spell allows the caster to transform one simple, nonliving substance into another simple, nonliving substance.
Lead into gold is a popular transformation. The drawback is
that the change is not permanent, but for the duration, the
item possesses the attributes and qualities of the transformed
material. How well the item mimics its new state depends
on the material’s complexity; the gamemaster uses the result
points of the spell’s skill roll to determine how successful
the transformation was. When the spell ends, it reverts to
the original state.
Up to five kilograms of material can be altered by this
spell. It will pass most — if not all — tests appropriate for
its new state. However, if a spell that detects magic is performed, the new material reveals that unnatural forces are
acting upon it.
Changed matter can be used as spell components providing
they are used within the spell’s duration. Nontheless, there
is an increased risk of spell failure. When using transformed
material, a Critical Failure always indicates that something
went wrong wtih the spell.

Deadeye
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 14
Effect: 27 (Skill Bonus (R9), +27 to marksmanship/firearms
totals)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 2 rounds (+5)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Incantations (-1): “Aim.” (phrase)
If a caster successfully casts this spell, she can temporarily
increase a target’s marksmanship/firearms skill by +27. While
this has no direct effect on damage, it provides for highly
accurate ranged weapon attacks, and it can be combined
with other modifiers. The spell is ideally used for snipers or
assassination attempts but can serve on any occasion when
the need for a precise shot is required.

Deafen
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 36
Effect: 27 (Hindrance: Deafness (R9), +6 to difficulties of
all hearing-dependent actions)
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+20): Sphere with radius of 4 meters
Components (-3): Small chime or bell (common)
Focused (+7): On targets
Gestures (-1): Ring chime or bell (simple)
When the caster rings a small bell, a loud noise can be
heard, deafening all in the designated area of effect. This
is likely to hinder all actions, as the inability to hear is not
only startling but unsettling. All hearing-based actions are
performed with a +6 difficulty modifier. Nothing can be heard
while affected by the spell.

Detect Presence
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 26
Effect: 18 (search of 6D to locate living beings)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 2 round (-5)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+7): On caster
Incantations (-1): “See all.” (phrase)
Variable Movement (+5): Bending/unseen target

Other Alterant (+1): Reveal cyborgs
This spell can locate someone who is hiding. The spell
confers 6D search dedicated to finding living entities only.
The difficulty is determined by either the target’s (or targets’)
hide total or the gamemaster. A success causes the located
subject to glow in a faint blue light, only visible to the caster.
The mage can look in a different direction once per round.
Besides hunting down people secreted away in a dark
room, it is also possible to determine the difference between
a human and a cyborg. In situations where cyborgs appear
human, they glow, revealing their nonliving nature.

Distract
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 22
Effect: 18 (persuasion of 6D)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Shiny trinket (ordinary)
Focused (+8): On target
Gestures (-1): Display the trinket while saying incantation (simple)
Incantations (-2): Simple instruction (sentence)
Unreal Effect (-5): Disbelief difficulty of 13
This spell allows a magic user to distract a target, making
that character believe there are other more pressing matters
to attend to. By the display of a mesmerizing bauble and a
simple suggestion, the caster could cause an attacker to suddenly halt and depart, or to make an enemy go on a journey
for the duration of the spell. The distracted character follows
any single command, within reason. Possibilities include “go
home,” “climb a tree,” “run to the nearest town,” and so on.
A successful roll of the skill given by the spell against the
target’s willpower/mettle (or the governing attribute) indicates
that the suggestion took hold.

Fancy Riding
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 9 (Skill Bonus: Animal Insight (R3), +9 to riding
totals)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Hair or fur of a beast of burden (ordinary, destroyed)
Focused (+6): On target
Incantations (-2): “Convey!.” (phrase, loud)
A target with this spell cast upon her recieves a +9 bonus
to her riding totals. For the duration of the spell, the target

has an understanding of beasts of burdens and their natures,
knowing how to handle them and keep them under control
in nearly any condition.

Fate
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 9 (Luck: Great (R1), confers 1 additional Fate Point
only)
Range: 25 meters (+15)
Speed: Instantaneous (+15)
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Component (-2): Common die (very common)
Concentration (-1): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Incantations (-1): “Hero.” (phrase)
With this spell, the mage persuasdes the Fates to smile
upon the hero (by granting the player one Fate Point that
may be used on any one action in the round following the
casting of the spell).
Those who attempt to abuse this spell should note that
Fate suffers no challenges lightly, and playing such games
can result in the demise of a character.

Find Trap
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 23
Effect: 18 (search of 6D for finding traps)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+9): Divination sphere with radius of 3.5
meters
Focused (+7): On target
Incantations (-2): “Where’d I put that trap?” (sentence)
The magic of this spell is focused upon devilish devices.
When the caster intonesthe incantation, the spell is activated,
providing the target with 6D in search that is limited in focus
to traps of any sort within 3.5 meters of the user. If the skill
roll is a success, then the spell user sees the located trap glow
green. The finder can point out the trap to others, but it is not
similarly revealed to them. For example, if the trap is invisible,
then it remains invisible after detected. Furthermore, seeing
a trap does not convey the ability to disarm it.

The Book of Malachi
This unusual book appears to possess a heavy leather
cover, with thick pages of what might be sheepskin.
Seemingly scrawled by the pen of a monk are the precise

lines of and unknown language, as well as illuminative
page. An Easy Knowledge/Intellect or a scholar roll reveals
this is an uncommon book for a monk or a monastery
to produce, as it has a devilish flavor to it.
In fact, the book was created in the tenth century in a
French monastery, but not through normal means. One
of the members of the order had been found practicing
magic, but only after a demon has possessed his physical body. The order acted quickly, performing a binding
ritual that locked both the unfortunate monk’s soul,
and the demon’s energy in the prepared vessel — The
Book of Malachi
Contents: The secrets of this book can be released
simply by the use of the understand gibberish spell (or a
similar spell). Casting this spell to read the book releases
a demon (of the gamemaster’s creation).
Protections: The book requires a special spell to
read.
Language: To all who look at the book, its weird
geometries of sketches and illuminations and bizarre
letters appear to be structured and form a language.
However, no amount of skill can decipher this book as
it is not in any particular language.
Reading Period: Once understand gibberish has been
cast, and the user looks upon the first page of the book,
the rest is done: The book manifests a demonic form,
and it “reads” itself. Within one minute, a fearsome
entity stands before the empty pages of the tome.

Find Way

Difficulty: 18
Effect: 14 (+3D to navigation)

The recipient of this spell garners a +3D bonus to her

including at sea, in a city, or in a maze.

Insight to Weakness

Difficulty: 22
Effect: 36 (Skill Bonus: Weakness Detection (R12), +36 to
melee combat totals)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 2 rounds (+5)

Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+8): On target
Incantations (-1): “See.” (phrase)
This spell grants the target +36 to melee combat totals for
two rounds. The magical incantation makes clear an opponent’s weaknesse and allows them to be taken advantage
of. No additional damage is directly conferred by this spell,
although a clever character might use it to strike at a head or
heart and perform a killing blow on an unwary opponent.

Illiterate
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 21
Effect: 3 (Illiterate (R1) Disadvantage)
Range: 1 kilometer (+15)
Speed: Instantaneous (+15)
Duration: 1 month (+32)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Components (-7): pen or quill (common); sheet of parchment (uncommon)
Gestures (-3): Write incantation and then repeat the
writing in reverse, repeating until the parchment is
covered (complex; languages/reading/writing roll with
difficulty of 11)
Focused (+7): On target
Incantations (-2): “I will not remember how to read.”
(sentence)
Unreal Effect (-1): Disbelief difficulty of 13
This devious spell causes the target to forget how to read.
While to some this is not distressing, to mages and scholars
it is a nightmare. As the ability to read has not actually been
erased, but has only been implanted in the subconscious of
the target, it is possible to disbelieve by making a willpower/
mettle roll (or the governing attribute) at a difficulty of 13.
Nonetheless, the situation is distressing, and the gamemaster
might consider modifiers if the target had recently bumped
her head or suffered a trauma that might cause her to believe
that she had actually lost the ability to read.

Insight into the Future
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 18 (up to 1 hour in the future)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 2 round (-5)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+7): On target
Incantations (-2): “Reveal the future so that I may slip
truly into it.” (sentence)
After casting this spell, the target gains insight into the
future through flashes of images, sounds, and smells. A

character can possibly bring these insights into focuse by
asking a question (such as, “Who’s on the other side of the
door I’m about to open?) and making an investigation rolls.
(She may do this no more than once per round.) The gamemaster decides on the difficulty, which should never be less
than Moderation, even for a simple yes-or-no question or one
centering on the near future. The higher the investigation roll
is above the difficulty, the clearer the insight becomes.

Investigate
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 30
Effect: 24 (Skill Bonus: Investigation (R8), +24 to investigation totals)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: Instantaneous (+4)
Duration: 1 week (+29)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)

Incantations (-1): “Learn.” (phrase)
When research is needed, this spell helps find information. When cast upon a target, he gains a bonus of +24 to

While this spell doesn’t assist in comprehension, it reveals
the best clues to follow up. It is also likely that a Heroic success
provides great insight into the matter being delved into.

Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 15 (persuasion of 5D)
Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)

Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Pin (ordinary)
Focused (+5): On target
Gestures (-1): Use pin to point at target (simple)
Incantations (-1): State simply the desired emotion
(phrase)
Unreal Effect (-4): Disbelief difficulty of 13
With a successful casting, the target must make an opposed
interaction roll against the spell’s persuasion of 5D. Failure
means that she has succumbed to the emotion suggested in
the incantation. Some single word examples are angry, happy,
laughing, sad, crying, pouting, cold, shy, frightened, amazed,
inspired, smitten, and so on. If it occurs, the moody target
can attempt to disbelieve by using willpower/mettle (or the
governing attribute) at a difficulty number of 13. When the
spell ends or is disbelieved, the effect discontinues.

Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Frog legs (very common)
Countenance (-1): Target’s legs take on a froggish appearance
Focused (+6): On target
Incantations (-1): “Bound.” (phrase)
This spell grants a temporary bonus of +15 to a character’s
jumping/climb/jump totals skill. For the duration of the spell,
the legs of the target take on the muscled appearance of those
of a frog’s legs. Although the bone structure remains the same,
a Moderate investigation roll discerns that there is something
usual about the muscles of the targeted person’s legs.

Mistaken Identity
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic, folk
Difficulty: 28
Effect: 24 (Shapechanging (R1), one specific person; Skill
Bonus: In Disguise (R5), +15 to bluff/con totals related to
disguise)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 week (+29)
Casting Time: 25 minutes (-16)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+10): On target
Incantations (-1): Repeat name of new identity (phrase)
Other Conditions: (-1): Target must know person
To properly use this spell requires that the target remain
in place for 30 minutes and that she knows the identity
she is going to assume. If the spell is a success, there is not
only a physical transformation — there is also a mental
transformation.
Once magically convinced, the target takes on the mannerisms, attitudes, and physical actions of the desired persona.
Any necessary memories are manufactured, which might
end up being a trigger to those who know the real person.
Nonetheless, until the spell wears off, as far as the target
knows, she is that person, so lie detectors and other means
of detecting fibs are fruitless.

Perfect Touch

Difficulty: 22

Effect: 36 (Skill Bonus: Perfect Touch (R12), +36 to sleight

Duration: 2 rounds (+5)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+8): On target
Incantations (-1): “When.” (phrase)
A successful casting of this spell allows the target to perform
the sleight of hand skill with heroic ability, granting a temporary bonus of +36 to such totals. This not really an increase
in ability so much as it is a unique understanding of how to
increase finger deftness or when to pick a pocket.

Range: 40 meters (+8)
Speed: Instantaneous (+8)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+20): Circle with radius of 10 meters
Components (-2): Drop of oil (ordinary, destoryed)
Gestures (-1): Rub oil between fingers (simple)
Incantations (-1): “Slip.” (phrase)
Upon casting this spell, a oily surface covers the designated area. Everyone within the affected area suffers a +6
difficulty modifier to most physical actions that involve leg
and feet movement.

Possess the Living Mind

may only read target’s mind)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): Personal possession of target (uncommon); chalk (very common)
Focused (+9): Mage’s mind stays with target
Gestures (-3): Draw circles and sigils of possession with
chalk (complex; artist roll with difficulty of 11)
Incantations (-2): “Open your mind to my thoughts.”
(sentence)
The canny mage can use this spell to ride along with another
being for a day. The caster perceives the world through the
target’s senses and can possibly read the victim’s thoughts.
(The result points from casting this spell are used on the
“Possession Knowledge” chart to determine how much
information the mage gathers.)
When attempting to possess another, the mage must make
a check of willpower/mettle (or the governing attribute) against
the standard interaction difficulty. Exceeding the difficulty
means that the target is unaware of the hitchhiker. Meeting
the difficulty indicates that the target knows someone else is
sharing her mind, though she doesn’t know who it is. Failure
means that victim managed to kick out the caster before he
could get a foothold.
In no case does the caster have any influence on the person’s actions. Additonally, the caster is only dimly aware of
what is going on around his body.

Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Fashioned leather tongue (common)
Focused (+5): On target
Gestures (-1): Point (simple)
The recipient of this spell can speak in an unknown tongue
with a limited languages/speaking skil of 6D. Unless a spell
that permits understanding languages is also cast on the
same target, it is not possible to understand a reply in the
language. The gamemaster determines the difficulty for the
target to express ideas, based upon how common or alien
the language is.

Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+15): Sphere with radius of 3 meters
Components (-4): Diamond (very rare)
Gestures (-1): Drop diamond on ground (simple)
Incantations (-1): “Stop magic.” (phrase)
When the mage casts this spell and drops the diamond up to
a meter from her, a magically disruptive sphere forms around
it. All who are within the sphere are protected against spells.
The spell doesn’t prohibit ranged attacks or fighting of any
sort within the sphere. However, the skill totals of all spells
directed at occupants in the area of effect are compared to
the effect’s value plus the result point bonus of the spell. If

the defending spell’s total is higher than the intruding spell’s
skill total, then the opposing spell is completely repulsed.
As the spell is not actually focused on the diamond or
anyone else, friend or foe may enter or leave the area without
disrupting the spell.

Speed: Instantaneous (+15)
Duration: 1 second (+0)
Casting Time: 3.5 seconds (-3)
Other Aspects:
Incantations (-1): “Stun.” (phrase)
With the utterance of a simple word, a mage can stun an
opponent. The successful casting of this spell causes 4D stun
damage to the intended target. All that is required is that
mental focus be placed upon the intended victim (with a
successful Moderate willpower/mettle roll). The spell effects
cannot be protected against by nonmagical armor. However,
the damage is treated as stun damage as indicated in the
“Damage” chapter of the rulebook.

Telepathy
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Folk, magic
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 24 (telepathy of 4D)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)

Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-2): 1 round with willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Focused (+8): On caster
This spell grants the target 4D in the telepathy skill. It functions identically to the Psionics skill as described in the D6
Adventure Rulebook chapter on “Psionics.” Because the skill
links minds, it is possible for one person to read the thoughts
of another character and determine if a lie is being told or
detect fear. When using this skill, refer to the “Empathy and
Telepathy” table and the “Lie Detecting” table.

Understand Gibberish
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 12 (4D languages — speaking or reading/writing in
D6 Fantasy)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 day (+25)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-1): Wax (ordinary)
Focused (+7): On target
Gestures (-1): Point (simple)
Through the aid of magic, it is possible for a targeted
character to understand any language or code. Providing the
spell is successful, the selected character gains 4D languages
(speaking or reading/writing in D6 Fantasy) in the specific
language being heard or read at the moment of casting. This
includes a normally unknown or undecipherable language,
although the task is much more difficult. Understand gibberish
also works with codes.
The gamemaster determines the difficulty, based upon
how common or unusual it is.

Voices
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Magic
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 24 (Skill Bonus: Throw Voice (R8), +24 to bluff/con
totals)
Range: 60 meters (+9)
Speed: Instantaneous (+9)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+10): Sphere with radius of 2 meters
Components (-3): Leather cord (common)
Gestures (-2): Pull on cord (fairly simple)
Incantations (-1): Whisper distracting words (phrase)
Unreal Effect (-6): Disbelief difficulty of 13
By uttering a few words, a guard or group of guards can
be led astray. If successfully cast, this spell gives the magic

user a +24 bonus to the bluff/con total needed for this spell.
The results can affect anyone in a specified two-meter radius
up to 60 meters away.
An opposed interaction roll is made against the target or
targets. Anyone failing this roll heads toward the direction
the caster made the voices appear to come from. For the
duration of the spell, the incantation words are repeated
over and over.

Elemental

(((begin sidebar)))
Many of the spells in this section are template spells —
they’re the ones with “template” after the name. A template
spell provides an easy shorthand way to write up several
different but very similar spells. Elemental spells benefit in
particular from templates, because many spells can be used
with any of the four elements — air, earth, fire and water.
Each template spell must be learned and cast as a separate
spell, but other than the type of element used for the spell,
all four spells are identical.

Acidic Attack
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Water
Difficulty: 20
Effect: 23 (5D physical damage, ignores nonmagical
armor)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: Instantaneous (+7)
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Component (-4): Small vile of acid (uncommon)
Focused (+6): On target
Gestures (-1): Shaking the vile at the target (simple)
Incantations (-1): “Burn!.” (phrase)
When a mage casts acidic attack, the spell lasts for 5 rounds.
Each round, damage continues, but is reduced by 1D. This
represents the acid’s potency gradually decreasing. Nonmagical armor does not offer a defense against this spell, as the
mystical corrosive promptly burns through metal, leather,
clothing, and so on.
As the attack is magical, there is no way to extinguish the
acid except to dispel it.

Burrow
Skill: Apportation
Arcane Knowledge: Earth
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 18 (moves up to 150 kilograms)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)
Other Aspects:

Components (-3): A mole skull (common)
Focused (+7): On caster
Gestures (-2): Digging motions with hands (fairly
simple)
Incantations (-1): “Dig.” (phrase)
Variable Movement (+1): Movement of 5 meters per
round
The burrow spell allows the caster to move through all types
of soil at a rapid pace. When the spell is completed, the caster
sinks into the earth in a fountain of dirt and sand. As he
travels through the earth, the soil in front of him is pushed
behind, collapsing the tunnel he creates. The mage using the
spell will have a rudimentary idea of which way he is going,
but he may need to poke his head back above the surface from
time to time to make sure he is not going off track.
The spell does not allow the caster to move through stone
or any material harder than clay. He usually travels one meter
under the surface, but if he encounters stone that he cannot
penetrate, he may go up or down in the strata to avoid it.
There is a small pocket of air that travels with the user,
allowing him to breathe as he wriggles through the soil.
Several trips to the surface during the duration are necessary
to refresh this air pocket.

Cone of Wind
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Air
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 18 (brawling/fighting of 6D)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 second (0)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)
Other Aspects:
Area (+10): Cone 8 meters long and 4 meters at its wide
end
Gestures (-1): Both hands make a pushing motion in the
direction of the wind (simple)
Incantations (-3): “Mighty wind, drive my enemies before
me!” (sentence, loud)
This spell is a favorite of mages who want to knock down
opponents without doing any permanent injury. When the
spell is cast a cone of powerful wind blasts from the caster’s
hands out to a distance of eight meters. The cone is about
30 centimeters wide at the casters hands and spreads out to
four meters in diameter at its far end.
The caster rolls the brawling/fighting score that the spell
generates once; this total is used as a knockdown attempt
against the combat difficulty for each target within one meter
of the caster. (Those over one meter away get a +1 bonus to

their defense totals per full meter distant.) Anyone who fails
to withstand the blast fall to the ground and must spend an
action in the next round getting up.
This attack affects opponents with a Physique/Strength
die code of no more than the spell’s skill total divided by 3
(ignore any remainder).
This spell does not require a separate targeting roll.

Control Elemental (Template)
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Entity, any one element: air, earth,
fire, or water
Difficulty: 18
Effect: 18 (command: elemental of 6D)
Range: 2.5 meters (+3)
Speed: Instantaneous (+3)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): Small figurine of elemental type, made
of precious metals and jewels (very rare)
Focused (+7): On caster
Gestures (-2): Make a circle with both arms (fairly
simple)
Incantations (-2): “(Type of elemental), bow to my will!”
(sentence, loud)
This spell bends the mind and will of an elemental, forcing
it to do the caster’s bidding. An elemental under the effects
of this spell becomes a slave to the caster, doing anything
he compels it to.
When the spell is cast, the caster generates a command:
elemental skill total and compares it to the willpower/mettle
total generated by the elemental. If the caster’s total is higher,
the elemental is his to command for the duration of the spell.
The caster will be aware that this spell is about to end just
before the duration expires, giving him time to recast the
spell if he wishes.
If the elemental makes a higher total than the caster of the
spell, the elemental may have a bad reaction to the caster, or
it may flee the area, depending on its type, relative power,
and temperament. Fire and water elemental will be more
likely to attack, being more mercurial and hostile, while air
and earth elementals will be more prone to flight.

Control Local Weather
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Air, inanimate forces, water
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 0 (changes based on result points)
Range: Self (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+55): Sphere with radius of 11 meters

Components (-6): A rainmaker, a statuette or tube made
of wood and designed to sound like rain when shaken
(common, destroyed)
Concentration (-5): 10 minutes with willpower/mettle
difficulty of 11
Gestures (-2): Broad sweeping hand motions toward the
sky (fairly simple)
Incantations (-4): “Powers of nature, make the weather my
slave.” (litany; willpower/mettle diffiuclty of 15)
This spell gives the caster the ability to control the weather
to a limited extent. To cast the spell, the mage concentrates
for 10 minutes on what type of weather he wants, and then
chants the incantation continuously for the remainder of
an hour.
The spell manipulates the temperature, pressure, and
humidty within 11 meters of the caster. How successful
he is in making the change depends on the result points of
the spell, as detailed below. When the duration expires, the
weather gradually returns to its prespell conditions.
The gamemaster decides on the local weather conditions
using the charts herein. Each level of change from the current conditions requires one result point. Thus, if the day is
fair with warm temperatures and a light breeze, to make it
cold and foggy with a strong wind requires four result points.
(A skill total equalling the difficulty may make one level of
change in aspect of the weather.)
The caster can also change the radius of the effect at a cost
of three result points for each additional meter.
As this is a magical change, the weather may not behave
as it would under normal circumstances.
It must always be remembered that changing the weather
in one place may also change it in some way somewhere
else. This can prompt revenge attacks from other mages
or angry residents, so users of this spell must exercise the
utmost care.

Control Local Weather Effects
Round all fractions up. Modifiers are cumulative.

Percipitation Levels
• None (fair weather)
• Fog (all sight-based actions have a difficulty modifier
equal to the result points, with a minimum of +1)
• Rain (or snow*)
• Freezing rain* (all physical actions have a difficulty
modifier equal to one-quarter of the result points,
with a minimum of +1)
• Sleet* (all physical actions have a difficulty modifier equal to one-half of the result points, with a
minimum of +1)
• Small hail** (damage per round equals one-quarter of
the result points, with a minimum of 1 point)
• Large hail** (damage per round equals one-half of the
result points, with a minimum of 1 point)

* Temperature must also be freezing. **Hail can be in
combination with rain/snow or no percipitation, at the
caster’s choice.

Temperature Levels
• Freezing (damage per round equals the result points,
with a minimum of 1 point)
The caster can cause any combination of these changes,
as long as the total point cost does not exceed 2 times the
result points of the spell casting.
• Expand the area affected by 1 meter: 5 points
• Change the temperature: Look up the desired change
in degrees Celsius under the Measures column of the “Spell
Measures” table; the equivalent value is the number of points
this changes costs
• Change the pressure by 0.01 bars: 1 point
• Change humidity by
With a minimal success, the caster may only raise or lower
the temperature within 2 degrees Celsius. A slight breeze
could be created, and perhaps some wispy, clouds. Average
success allows the caster to raise or lower the temperature
by 5 degrees, conjure or dispel a moderate amount of cloud
cover, and a stiff breeze of less than 10 kph could also be created or canceled. Good success on the casting roll will allow
the mage to cause or cancel light rain or snow, change the
temperature by up to 10 degrees, and change the wind speed
by up to 20 kph. Truly powerful weather conditions can be
created or stopped with a superior success. the temperature
can be raised or lowered by 20 degrees, and wind speed can
be modified by up to 40 kph. A thunderstorm or snowstorm
can be conjured or canceled. Spectacular success allows the
temperature to be raised or lowered by 30 degrees, wind
changes of up to 80 kph, and the ability to create or cancel
powerful storms of rain or snow.
• Cold
• Warm
• Hot (all physical actions have a difficulty modifier
equal to one-quarter of the result points, with a
minimum of +1)
• Very hot (damage per round equals one-half of the
result points, with a minimum of 1 point)

Wind Levels
• None
• Light breeze
• Moderate winds
• Strong winds (all physical actions have a difficulty
modifier equal to one-quarter of the result points,
with a minimum of +1)
• Gale (all physical actions have a difficulty modifier
equal to one-half of the result points, with a minimum of +1)
• Storm (all physical actions have a difficulty modifier
equal to the result points, with a minimum of +1)

• Hurricane/tornado (all physical actions have a difficulty modifier equal to 1.25 times the result points,
with a minimum of +1; the gamemaster may also
decide that small items are whipped about, causing injury)

Create Element (Template)
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: any one element: air, earth, fire, or
water
Difficulty: 11
Effect: 10 (100 liters or 0.1 cubic meters)
Range: 3.5 meters (+3)
Speed: Instantaneous (+3)
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gestures (-2): Cup hands, whisper into them, then mime
throwing toward target spot (fairly simple)
Incantations (-3): “Elemental Powers, create (name of
element)!” (sentence, loud)
This is one of the first spells learned by many elemental
mages. By casting the spell, the mage conjures a small amount
of the element in its raw form. Water appears as a puddle if
there is no container to hold it; fire burns away merrily without
fuel; air disperses into the space around it; and earth appears
in a pile on the ground. None of these conjured elements can
be used as a weapon by creating them on or inside a person;
the effect of the spell makes the element only in a clear area
unoccupied by another person or object.
As this is magically crafted material, it doesn’t have all the
physical characteristics as natural elements. For example,
created water does not stay around long enough to be fully
digested by the body, but it can be used for cleansing. The
fire only can be used to shed illumination. Air might aid in
respiration. Earth could be used to design a small enclosure.
The specific game benefits of these are based on the result
points and determined by the gamemaster.

Create Elemental (Template)
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: any one element: air, earth, fire, or
water
Difficulty: 34
Effect: 68 (15 attribute dice, arranged as the caster likes; Body
Points/Wounds and movement based on result points)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 10 minutes (-14)
Other Aspects:
Components (-10): 1 carat gemstone, see below for type
(very rare, destroyed)
Concentration (-5): 10 minutes with willpower/mettle
difficulty of 11
Focused (+17): On created elemental

Gestures (-2): Circular hand motions with gemstone component (fairly simple)
Incantations (-4): Long speech explaining exact details
of the type of elemental desired (litany; persuasion roll
with difficulty of 15)
In many elemental mage circles, the ability to cast this
spell successfully is what differentiates the true masters of
the art from the pretenders. Performing the spell successfully
creates a powerful servant composed of the elemental type
specified by the spell. The caster dictates the attributes of the
final form that the elemental takes as part of the spell. Some
samples are given below of the different type of elementals
that can be created.
The type of gemstone needed for the spell varies with what
type of elemental the caster is creating: Air needs a diamond,
earth requires an emerald, fire specifies a ruby, and water
uses a blue sapphire.
The elemental created is not necessarily under the control
of the caster. A smart mage will be prepared to cast the control elemental spell immediately. Alternately, some casters
who have an intimate knowledge of elementals may try to
use gifts or promises of future favors to bribe the elemental
into serving them.
The 15 attribute dice may be allocated as the caster sees
fit, and with the gamemaster’s permission, she may use some
of the dice to buy Special Abilities to reflect the natural abilities of the elemental. The elemental will have a number of
Body Points equal to 10 plus the points by which the spell
beat the difficulty; Wound levels equal to the points above
the difficulty, divided by two, rounded up, minimum of one
Wound level. Movement equals the result points in meters
per round, with a minimum of one meter per round.

Sample Elementals
Here are some sample elementals that could be
created with this spell. Special Abilities are given for
point cost reference. The attribute names are from D6
Adventure; gamemasters and players using other genres
should convert the names.
Air Elemental: Reflexes 2D, Coordination 2D,
Physique 2D, Knowledge 1D, Perception 1D, Charisma
1D. Move: 1+. Strength Damage: 1D. Body Points: 10+/
Wound levels: 1+. Natural Abilities: Flight (R1, 6 points),
flying rate equals 2 times Move.
Earth Elemental: Reflexes 2D, Coordination 1D,
Physique 6D, Knowledge 1D, Perception 1D, Charisma
1D. Move: 1+. Strength Damage: 3D. Body Points: 10+/
Wound levels: 1+. Natural Abilities: Natural Armor (R1,
3 points) +1D to damage resistance totals.
Fire Elemental: Reflexes 4D, Coordination 3D,
Physique 3D, Knowledge 1D, Perception 1D, Charisma
1D. Move: 1+. Strength Damage: 2D. Body Points: 10+/
Wound levels: 1+. Natural Abilities: Natural Ranged
Weapon: Flame (R1, 3 points), 3D damage.

Water Elemental: Reflexes 3D, Coordination 3D,
Physique 4D, Knowledge 1D, Perception 1D, Charisma
1D. Move: 1+. Strength Damage: 2D. Body Points: 10+/
Wound levels: 1+. Natural Abilities: Natural Armor (R1,

Desiccate
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Water
Difficulty: 16
Effect: 18 (3D physical damage, ignores all armor)
Range: 5 meters (+5)
Speed: Instantaneous (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)
Other Aspects:
Component (-4): Small strip of dried rawhide (very common, destroyed)
Focused (+5): Target of the spell
Gestures (-1): Point at target (simple)
Incantations (-2): “Drought shall be your death!” (sentence)
Other Conditions (-1): Ineffective against those without
fluid in their bodies
This is a particularly nasty spell, used by sorcerers with
little regard for mercy. The spell is targeted with a marksmanship/firearms or apportation roll. If the attack is successful,
the target takes 3D of damage each round for the next 12
rounds. This damage is caused by the rapid desiccation, or
removal of fluid, from all of the target’s soft tissues. This is
an extremely painful and unpleasant process to say the least,
and if the spell does enough damage to kill the target, all that
is left is a dried, mummy-like husk.
Armor is ineffective against this damage, since the damage comes from inside the target’s body. Any creature that
does not have fluid inside of it, like a golem or other creature
made of stone, is unaffected.

Drown
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Water
Difficulty: 21
Effect: 36 (6D physical damage, ignores all armor)
Range: 2.5 meters (+2)
Speed: Instantaneous (+2)
Duration: 2 rounds (+5)
Casting Time: 3.5 seconds (-3)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): A mouthful of water (ordinary,
destroyed)
Focused (+5): On target
Gestures (-2): Spit mouthful of water at target (fairly
simple)
Incantations (-2): “A sailor’s death shall take you!” (sentence)

To cast this spell, the mage fills his mouth with water,
spits it at the target, and speaks the incantation. The spell
is aimed with a throwing (not apportation) roll. If it hits successfully, the target’s lungs fill with water and she begins to
drown, taking 6D of damage for the next two rounds. Armor
does not help absorb this damage, but the target can make
a stamina roll with a difficulty equal to the caster’s spell skill
total to expel the water from his lungs after the first round.
If successful, he takes no damage from the second round of
the spell effect.

Earth Muse
Skill: Divination
Arcane Knowledge: earth, time
Difficulty: 19
Effect: 34 (2.5 months in the past)
Range: 1 meter (+0)
Speed: Instantaneous (+0)
Duration: 5 minutes (+13)
Casting Time: 40 minutes (-17)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+21): Divination sphere with radius of 25
meters
Components (-5): A miniature sundial (uncommon); dirt
or stone (ordinary)
Concentration (-2): 1 round with a willpower/mettle difficulty of 8
Gestures (-2): As the incantation is spoken, place hands on
the stone or ground in the center of the area of effect;
slowly, draw in the arms and place the palms on closed
eyes. After pausing for several seconds, throw hands
out wide. (fairly simple)
Incantations (-4): Utter the following after meditation: “Oh
mighty spirits who have seen all, heed my plea and answer
my call. The time grows nigh to share your thoughts;
come to me now and show what time has wrought!”
(litany; persuasion roll with difficulty of 15)
Although there are many who may choose to think otherwise, there are beings that dwell just beyond the realm of
human perception. These spiritual elemental forces of nature
often live far longer than the mere mortals who sometimes
rudely intrude upon their realm. Theirs is the gift of knowledge, for these enigmatic souls have experienced much during their existence. The power of the earth muse spell allows
the mage to communicate with elemental forces that dwell
within the ground, untamed stone or stone structures. Such
creatures are able to speak of things that have occurred in
the spell’s area of effect. Persistent characters who repeatedly question the earthen sages about items or events that
are out of their range of caring (events that are more than
2.5 months old) or beyond the area of effect cause the spell
to abruptly end. The caster has worn out her welcome with
the beings that she’s trying to gather information from. If
this should happen, no spirits will answer the caster’s call
for 24 hours should she attempts to recast earth muse in
the same area. A Critical Failure along with a failed skill roll

when attempting to cast earth muse temporally blights the
intended area of effect and no earth muse spells will function
there for 24 hours.

Earthquake
Skill: Alteration
Arcane Knowledge: Earth
Difficulty: 32
Effect: 15 (5D physical damage)
Range: 1 kilometer (+15)
Speed: 10 meters per second (+5)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+30): Circle with radius of 15 meters
Components (-10): A diamond of at least 1 carat (very
rare, destroyed)
Concentration (-5): 10 minutes with willpower/mettle
difficulty of 11
Gestures (-3): A series of foot and hand gestures (complex;
acrobatics roll with difficulty of 11)
Incantations (-4): Complex litany of elemental names and
formulas (litany; languages/speaking roll with difficulty
of 15)
Other Alterants (+30): +10D additional damage done to
stationary targets
Other Conditions (-1): Cannot affect anything flying
Casting this spell causes the ground within the area of
effect to be shaken by violent tremors. Anything or anyone
touching the ground will take 5D of damage for each full
round they spend inside the area of the quake. Stationary
targets — such as trees and buildings — take an additional
10D of damage per round. Any movement through the area
of the quake decreases by a number of meters per round equal
to the result points (minimum adjustment of zero), as the
shaking throws about objects and heaves the ground.
Because the area of the spell is so large, no targeting roll
is necessary. The caster may simply center the quake on any
point within the range.
After the spell is cast, it takes the quake some time to begin.
Use the “Spell Measures” chart in the rulebook to find the
value of the range from the caster to the center of the quake,
subtract the speed value of 5, and look up this number on the
chart. Convert the related measure to minutes or seconds to
see how long it takes the quake to begin.

Gestures (-1): Touch subject (simple)
Incantations (-2): “(Name of element), protect me and
harm my foe!” (sentence)
Other Alterant (+6): Effect doubled against one opposite
element (specified at time of casting)
When cast, this spell covers the body of the target (and
anything she wears or holds) in a sheath of the element.
This sheath provides armor and adds damage to any attacks
made with appendages or hand-held weapons. The armor
and damage effects are doubled if they are used against
the opposite element. For example, a mage sheathed in fire
would do double damage against water-based creatures, and
his armor from the spell would protect him double from
water-based attacks.

Duration: 1 second (0)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Area Effect (+15): Sphere with radius of 3 meters
Components (-1): A tiny amount of the element used in
the burst (ordinary)
Gestures (-2): Move both hands inward, and then throw
them out like an explosion (fairly simple)
Incantations (-2): “(Name of element), destroy my enemies
with your power!” (sentence)
A favorite of many combat mages, this spell conjures a
powerful burst of the element, damaging all the targets within
its area. The spell does not discern between friend and foe,
so the caster must use care in aiming the blast.
The form of the shot depends on the element used: Air is
a concussive inward blast; earth, a hail of rocks; fire, a huge
burst of flame; and water, a powerful drowning wave.
The caster generates a throwing or apportation total against
the combat difficulty of the main target. The total receives a
+3, because the spell covers a large area, making it easier to
hit the target. Those more than a meter away from the center
with defense totals greater than the targeting roll (without
the bonus) dodge out of the way. For everyone else, reduce the
damgae done by 1 for each meter away from the center.

Other Aspects:
Focused (+4): On a weapon
This simple spell covers the dangerous part of a weapon
with a sheath of energy that causes extra damage. The type
of energy varies depending on the elemental type of the
spell: Air covers the weapon in electricity, earth is acid, the
fire sheath is flames, and water is brutally cold ice. For the
duration of the spell, the weapon inflicts an additional 3D of
damage every time it successfully strikes a target.

Gestures (-2): Wave hands over components (fairly
simple)
Incantations (-2): “Elements of the universe, show me this
person’s future.”(sentence)
According to some philosophies, the entire universe is
composed of the four elements. By drawing upon the connection of these elements to all things, the caster can pull
back the veil of time and peer into the future. Because the
future is not set, the visions that the caster sees of the future
may or may not come true, and divination is far from an exact
science. The act of seeing what will happen in the target’s
future can often change the future as well, so anything seen
with this spell should be taken with a grain of salt in the best
of circumstances.
To cast the spell, the mage spends one minute murmuring
the incnatation over the elements and the bit of the target.
At the end of that time, the caster receives a burst of insight,
highlighting about five minutes’ worth of events for the next
month of the target’s life. The result points of the casting roll
determine how much information the caster can get about
the target’s future.
Zero points reveals small details and perhaps a few flashes of
important facts. One to four points allows the most important
or dangerous event to be revealed, without a great amount of
detail. Five to eight points gives more information about the
key event, and a much closer timeframe, along with minor
details. Nine to 12 points allows even more details and vague

information about the remainder of the day surrounding the
key as well. More than 12 points reveals up to five minutes
of the most important event like a movie, plus gives a decent
recounting of the remainder of the month, even if that would
make duration longer than five minutes.
Example: Morgan the mage wants to see into her companion Bator’s future. She successfully casts the spell. If
she achieved a minimal success, she would know that Bator
will be in grave danger during the next month. On a solid
success, she would know that the fighter was going to be
ambushed some time in the afternoon of the following day.
Good success would tell Morgan that Bator was going to be
ambushed by a large group; sometime in the early afternoon.
Superior success would tell the mage that the rest of Bator’s
month will be uneventful, and that the ambush was going
to be from a group of 15 goblins at 2:00 p.m. Finally, if the
mage manages to achieve Spectacular success, she will see the
ambush as if it were happening in front of her, with a good
amount of exacting detail.
Note that in the example above the mage was never told
exactly where the ambush would happen, or how to avoid it.
Even if Bator stays right where he is for a month, the ambush
could still happen, but the details would change slightly from
the vision seen by the scrying mage. The gamemaster should
never let a good roll on a divination spell disrupt the game.

Flame Jet
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Fire
Difficulty: 17
Effect: 12 (4D physical damage)
Range: 3 meters (+3)
Speed: Instantaneous (+3)
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): A small open flame (ordinary,
destroyed)
Gestures (-1): Point finger (simple)
Focused (+4): On caster’s finger
Incantations (-1): “Burn!” (phrase)
Variable Duration (+8): On/off switch
This spell causes a roaring line of fire to erupt from the
caster’s fingertip. The jet is only a few centimeters across,
but it extends out to about three meters from the caster.
The caster can freely turn the effect on and off during the
one minute duration, to avoid accidentally burning things
he does not want to. Marksmanship/firearms or apportation is
used to aim the jet if it is being used as an attack. The caster
can make one attack with it per round.

Lightning Bolt
Skill: Conjuration
Arcane Knowledge: Inanimate Forces
Difficulty: 15
Effect: 18 (6D physical damage)

Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: Instantaneous (+10)
Duration: 1 second (0)
Casting Time: 2.5 seconds (-2)
Other Aspects:
Components (-4): A small steel or iron rod (very common);
a piece of wool (very common)
Gestures (-2): Rub the wool on the steel rod, and then
mimic flinging a bolt (fairly simple)
Incantation (-3): “Power of lightning, smite my foe!”
(sentence, loud)
Other Alterant (+3): Gain a bonus against targets wearing metal
Other Conditions (-1): Targeting difficulty increased when
used near large amounts of metal
This spell generates a powerful stroke of lightning. The
caster must aim the bolt using throwing or apportation. If
the target of spell is wearing large amounts of metal, (a suit
of chain or plate armor, for example), she is much easier to
hit, giving a modifier of +3 to the targeting total. If a large
piece of metal is within a meter of the caster or the target,
a modifier of +3 should be added to the difficulty to hit the
target, because the metal will tend to pull the lightning away
from its intended path.

About Magical Artifacts

The artifacts descriped in this chapter are but a few
that can appear in your worlds. They have not been
designed with any sort of formula. Rather, the author
presents a description of the items, along with a few
appropriate game mechanics. The game mechanics are
based on Special Abilities as much as possible, with the
occasional mechanic specially designed to describe the
artifact’s unique abilities.
Gamemasters can use these items — as well as
those discussed in the D6 Adventure and D6 Fantasy
rulebooks — as they are presented, modify them as
needed, or create their own after being inspired by
exisiting ones.
Players who want to make magical artifacts should
be required to follow the existing magic system. The
arduousness of the task may be just the thing to keep
all but the most determined from haphazardly presenting items that could have severe game-imbalancing
consequences.
(((sidebar)))
(((sidebar)))

The Cost of Artifacts
Some items in this chapter list a price difficulty.
Because of the variance in monetary units between
the three D6 System genre books (not to mention on
various worlds), no equivalent coin, credit, or dollar
value has been designated. Gamemasters should use the
“Price Difficulties” chart found at the beginning of the
“Equipment” chapter to select a suitable value. Don’t
fret about getting the number exact: If the characters
were to ask 100 different people about its value, they’d
likely get 100 different answers. Not everyone recognizes the value of these priceless and near-priceless
relics, and some may deliberately under- or overvalue
the artifacts in order to get what they want.

Tome of Many Doorways

This oversized, medieval manuscript is bound in an ornate
but antiquated leather cover embossed with gold. The first half
contains a treatise on travel to different locations, times, and
even dimensions. The second half offers brilliantly illustrated
glimpses of other destinations, with detailed incantations
inscribed around the frame for each illumination.
The book was compiled, recorded, and illuminated by the
legendary sorcerer Aphastenes. Anyone making a Moderate investigation roll gathers enough information about the

author to recall that he later went mad and disappeared
entirely, possibly as a result of his magical experimentation
with interplanar gateways.
Only characters with some training in the magical arts
(those with dice in any Magic skill) can read and even hope
to comprehend the concepts discussed in the essay about
summoning transport passageways. Those who carefully
read the treatise gain a +5 bonus to any investigation rolls to
deduce information about particular destinations illustrated
in the second half.
A few illuminations stand out amidst the myriad pictures
decorating the pages in the tome’s latter portion:
• A town with buildings constructed using unnatural angles
and glasslike, reflective substances.
• A vast cathedral interior with columns, arcades, and
archways stretching off to the horizon.
• A desolate battlefield strewn with bodies and wreckage,
with a blackened sky looming above.
• The room the heroes occupy at the moment they read the
tome, complete with representations of themselves.
• A village square where a crowd has gathered to witness
an imminent execution.
(((sidebar)))

Tome of Many Doorways:
Gamemaster’s Tip
The tome depicts at least 100 different illustrations,
some of which change entirely or alter over time.
Gamemasters can include destinations from their
current campaign or locations to which they hope to
entice the heroes.
(((sidebar)))

Location
Although one might discover the tome as part of some
treasure trove, it most likely inhabits the dusty corner of a
vast library, long forgotten or mistaken as yet another ancient
volume. A museum could exhibit it as some medieval oddity
and an example of fine calligraphy produced in an age before
printing presses. Private collectors might keep the manuscript
in their personal library or display it among other antique
trophies. Owners with the magical ability and understanding
to use it ensure the volume has adequate protection from
thieves, rival collectors, or those seeking to use its powers
to further their own ends.
Ancient references might direct characters seeking the
tome to its current whereabouts. Aphastenes appears in
legends involving time travel, sorcerers, and travels to fantastic “islands.” Legends and relevant signs might point to
the place where Aphastenes hid the book between journeys,
for it was far too immense and unwieldy to carry with him
on his earthly adventures. If already uncovered, news of the
tome’s acquisition by the current owner also might give a
clue to its location.

Powers
Upon reading the first half of the tome, a person with
dice in apportation gains the general knowledge to attempt
to open a portal to another place, time, or dimension using
the illuminated illustrations and incantations in the second
half. To do so, the user opens the book to the appropriate
illustrated page and reads aloud the spell inscribed along
its border. The incantations do not work without the book
open to the proper portal page, nor can one who has used
the book before recall an incantation and attempt to invoke
a portal without the book present.
The user must chant the incantation properly and make
a Difficult apportation roll to open the doorway. Modify the
difficulty depending on the intended destination:
Destination
Modifier
On the same planet
0
Another planet
+5
Another dimension
+10
A different time
+15
(cumulative with other modifiers)
Unless she can identify the destination by elements
depicted in an illustration, the caster might not know precisely whether a location is on the same planet, in the same
time, or inhabiting the same dimension.
Those who succeed in this roll cause the illustration to
momentarily sizzle with electricity before it arcs off the page
and spins into a three-meter-diameter circle. The air within
this shimmers and refocuses until it shows the intended
destination, which usually matches the depiction in the
tome. Crackling blue lightning highlights the portal’s thorny
edges, but travelers can pass through without any ill effects.
The passage remains open for five minutes, after which it
collapses on itself and consumes anyone trapped between
locations (inflicting 15D damage).
Summoning such a portal does not come without its price.
When a portal collapses, the caster suffers so much internal
and mental fatigue that she essentially becomes Wounded or
drops to 50% of her total Body Points. The caster can recover
from such damage through normal means (through rest or
medicine/healing rolls).

Hazards
Using the tome involves several risks. Simply because a
caster can open a portal does not necessarily mean she and
her comrades can survive on the other side. Those entering
dimensions or locations with hostile environments should
realize their peril quickly and return through the gate before
it dissipates. Creatures or people from the other side can also
pass through to the present time and location, where they
often wreak havoc.
Failing the roll to properly open a given portal may have
several results. The passage may simply not appear at all. The
portal could wind up in the corresponding destination, but
not at the proper time period. The gate might lead to a parallel destination in a hostile dimension where the characters’
knowledge and assumptions no longer apply.

Occasionally, illustrated pages have worn or even torn
edges that eliminate part of the incantation necessary to
open that particular portal. Qualified spellcasters can try
improvising the chant based on the syntax found framing
other illuminations; their attempts to open the portal suffer
a +10 modifier to the difficulty.
The tome can prove harmful to anyone without the ability
to read the book’s cramped calligraphy or anyone without dice
in a Magic skill. Such people spending any time reading or even
glancing at the pictures must make a Difficult willpower/mettle
roll to resist staring mindlessly at the captivating words and
images for indefinite periods of time. Mesmerized readers
remain so until physically shaken from their trance.

Tarnhelm

The Tarnhelm looks like a bronze, conical helmet with
stylized metallic wings arching up from its ornately decorated rim. It radiates a regal, imposing presence, as if some
great warrior or king once wore it and imbued the helm with
his majestic aura. Its brim seems constructed to best fit a
middle-aged human, though it weighs somewhat less than
one would expect for a bronze helm.
The helmet’s magical power enables the wearer to transform herself into the shape of any creature, mundane or
fantastic, assuming the beast’s powers until returning to
her original form (or another animal form), upon wearing
the helm again.
Few know the helm’s true origins, though many have
speculated and theorized. Myths claim an ancient race of
dwarves forged the Tarnhelm as part of vast treasure trove.
They supposedly used it for their own ends, transforming their
agents into animals useful in their wars against others, both
small spies like sparrows and mice and immense beasts of
battle like trolls and dragons. Such cautionary myths always
maintain the dwarves lost the helm to those who grew jealous
of its powers, particularly those who hoard riches like great
rulers, sorcerers, dragons, and giants.
Scholars believe the Tarnhelm gave rise to numerous
legends about shapeshifting wizards or others who could
transform into various animals; some tales mention a helm
or other accoutrement required for the transformation, while
others attribute such powers directly to the shapeshifting
hero.
Most myths about the Tarnhelm include warnings against
possessing it and using it for personal gain or underhanded
deeds. Many believe it caused various blood feuds, violent
misunderstandings, and even wars. Those who learned of its
powers became engulfed by a jealous desire to possess it for
themselves at any cost.
One cannot put a price on such a powerful magical artifact; those unaware of its true nature who believe it some
archaeological treasure might deem it very expensive (Heroic
Funds difficulty), while those who understand its powers and
can bear to part with the Tarnhelm might command a costly
price (Legendary Funds difficulty).

Locations
Although the Tarnhelm’s exact location remains secret,
many searching for it hope to find it as part of a larger treasure
hoard, usually guarded by a jealous and powerful owner. It
often seems like one of the more mundane armor trinkets
hidden among troves of gold coins, exquisite jewelry, and
finely wrought weapons; the owner might not even realize
its true power, believing the Tarnhelm just one more shiny
bauble in a pile of riches.
Those greedy enough to amass a treasure hoard in which
the Tarnhelm seems a lesser trinket still keep careful watch
over their possessions, presenting a challenge for anyone
actively seeking to abscond with the helmet. Dragons have
their deep caverns, giants their well-locked castles, kings their
guarded treasure vaults, and wizards their enchanted towers.
Given its dwarf-forged nature, the helmet might reside in a
cave deep beneath the earth, in a currently occupied dwarven
stronghold or a cavern long abandoned by that species.
In more modern times, the Tarnhelm might also exist as
a lone artifact, probably as part of a private or public collection of Celtic or Teutonic armor. Owners who understand
the Tarnhelm’s potential keep it locked up and well guarded.
Once they’ve toyed with its powers, they protect it at all
costs lest someone steal it before they can transform back
into their original shape.
No matter where it rests — as a trinket in a treasure
hoard or a lone object in a collection — any owner who
realizes its power guards it jealously with whatever available resources.

Powers
As long as a subject wears the helm, she possesses amazing shapeshifting abilities. She can alter her form to that of
any creature, mundane or fantastic, whether or not she’s
previously seen one. The helm essentially grants the wearer
unlimited ranks of the Shapechanging Special Ability, with
the character retaining her Body Points, Wounds, and
Intellect/Knowledge, and shifting other attributes to suit
her newly assumed form (for more details see the Shapechanging entry in the “Character Options” chapter of the
genre rulebooks).
When assuming the same form on subsequent occasions,
the subject always looks like the same individual of that
species, adopting the same coloration, facial features, and
other aspects of an individual. For instance, she always
changes into the same dragon each time she adopts a draconian form. She cannot assume the exact appearance of a
particular individual.
Once the subject removes the helm, she retains that form
until she somehow puts it back on her head (or crawls beneath
or into it) and gains access to the artifact’s shapeshifting
powers. Other spells or artifacts that allow one to transform
into other living creatures also work on the subject, though
this involves some degree of danger.

Tarnhelm Powers: Unlimited levels of the Shapechanging
Special Ability, with Magically Empowered (R2) and Burn-out
(R1), can be lost or stolen.

Hazards
Jealousy reigns as the primary hazard in using the Tarnhelm. Obtaining it again to transform to a new creature
or back to one’s normal shape often presents a challenge,
especially if someone has taken the unattended helmet for
themselves. This functions as the Special Ability Limitation
Burn-out (R1), in that the Tarnhelm can be lost or stolen,
depriving a transformed subject of the means to return to
their original form.
Unless the subject retains a relatively humanoid form,
she cannot wear the helm; creatures without digits to hold
or carry items or those too small or weak to carry the helm
cannot take it with them. If the subject takes a smaller
form, and the helm sits upright on a flat surface, she can’t
necessarily get underneath to “wear” the helmet and effect
a new transformation. Depending on where one left the
Tarnhelm at the time of transformation — or where someone
else has taken it — the transformed subject might have a
formidable challenge reaching it to change back into their
original form.
The Tarnhelm’s inherent jealousy even affects other magic.
Should anyone attempt to change the form of one transformed
by the helmet’s powers, and they roll a Critical Failure on the
Wild Die, the subject does not change into the new form, but
becomes permanently stuck in the earlier form.

Wings of the Holy Avenger

The Wings of the Holy Avenger consist of a breastplate
and shoulder pauldrons with feathery eagle wings joined to
the suit’s backplate by ovoid metal pods. Decorative motifs
incorporating stylized images of feathers, angular knots, and
curled flames adorn the armor. When dormant, the wings
remain compactly folded against the backplate. Though they
might collect dust, the wings do not deteriorate with time,
and they resist most forms of damage. Those wearing this
artifact look like images seen in some medieval churches and
monasteries depicting winged warriors soaring into battle
against infidel hordes or demonic foes.
The armor and wings came from an angelic being struck
down during a turbulent battle in primordial times. Her
agony and the power of the unholy blast that felled her
fused her wings to the armor. Left on the raging battlefield
between Heaven and Earth, the armor sat forgotten until
discovered by priests who later came to bury the dead with
proper ceremony and respect. Few know what happened after
the armor’s discovery in ancient times. At isolated points
throughout history, legends recall a winged warrior leading
troops in a desperate fight, though such a figure disappears
shortly after the battle, along with the aerial armor.
Some scholars suggest a Legendary price for this special
armor.

Locations
Given its religious origins, the Wings of the Holy Avenger
most likely reside in the vaults of an ancient church, temple,
or monastic retreat. Protective monks might have secreted
it in a nearby cave or crypt to keep it from those who might
misuse its power. If it was pilfered by thieves or looted by
invading armies, it might reside in some treasure hoard,
though few of a military mind who gaze upon the armor can
resist using it. Those guardians who know if its existence
do not speak of it, preferring to leave the powerful artifact
dormant until a worthy hero requires it to restore order and
stability to the world.
The otherworldly melding of metal and feather creates
a striking but disturbing appearance that stands out when
displayed openly with similar accoutrements. Collectors
who possess it gain no pride by showing it off, and simply
open themselves to thieves seeking the armor for their own
purposes. Few owners openly wear the Wings of the Holy
Avenger; doing so would attract the attention of those seeking to steal or destroy it. They reserve its use for the most
dire battles where defeat remains an absolutely unacceptable
outcome.
At least one suit of armor exists, though others may lie
hidden, collected from other angels struck down in battle.
Religious officials deny they possess such an artifact, and
they imply the magical nature of any similar devices casts an
unholy and heretical aura over those who use them.
A single warrior wearing the wings can inspire her followers in battle; a small squad of soldiers equipped with such
armor could pose a formidable threat. Myths indicate that
this artifact may be related to other legendary items, including the Avenging Blade and the Shield of Faith.

Powers
The Wings of the Holy Avenger embody manifold powers. The breastplate and pauldrons function as plate armor,
providing the wearer with a +3D Armor Value to his torso.
The artifact’s enchanted nature negates any encumbrance
penalties. Its magical auras also give the wearer a +6 bonus
to damage resistance totals against any type of damage, even
to portions of the body the armor does not cover.
The wings function through a sympathetic link with the
wearer’s mind, effected through the backplate’s ovoid metal
interfaces between the armor and wings. They enable flight
(as the Special Ability of the same name) for a human-sized
creature wearing the armor. Although the wings seem to
ignore the outward effects of damage, they still cease to function properly as the wearer accumulates damage penalties
that affect his flying skill.
Magic imbuing the entire suit gives the wearer a Skill Bonus
for battlefield presence skills: +3 to all command, flying, and
intimidation rolls. The wearer acts as if trained in these skills
even if he has not allocated any additional pips in them.
Wings of the Holy Avenger Powers: Natural Armor:
Armor (R3),+3D to damage resistance rolls, with Restricted
(R2), limited to torso; Hardiness (R6), wearer adds 6 to dam-

age resistance totals against any type of damage; Flight (R3),
wearer can fly using the flying skill at a rate equal to her base
Move times 6; Skill Bonus: Battlefield Presence (R3), +3 to
command, flying, and intimidation total; all Special Abilities
have Magically Empowered (R2); Minor Stigma (R1), wearer
must properly buckle harness before use; Restricted: Enemy
(R1), those who know of this artifact actively seek to destroy
the owner; and Burn-out (R1), can be lost or stolen.

Hazards
Wearing the Wings of the Holy Avenger does not come
without complications. The subject must properly harness
herself into the armor to ensure smooth operation. She makes
a Moderate know-how roll to lace up the various straps, harness buckles, pads, and braces. Failure reduces the Natural
Armor protectioni to +2D and eliminates the Skill Bonus. Once
properly buckled, the armor adapts to the wearer’s body type
to fit comfortably and allow unrestricted movement.
Despite the armor’s inherent bonus to flying, those without flight experience often find the wings difficult to operate the first time. Since they’re not mechanical and key off
emotional impulses triggering flight, the wings require some
initial testing. A Moderate know-how roll allows the wearer
to understand how the wings function; failure imposes a +10
modifier on all flying difficulties until the character takes
the time to flex the wings, make another know-how roll, and
becoming familiar with their operation.
Anyone who sees the subject wearing and using the armor
realizes its power and identifies the person as the most formidable opponent in a fight; adversaries immediately focus
their attacks on the wearer to take her out of the battle. This
gives the wearer the Disadvantage of Enemy (R1), even if
seen later without the Wings of the Holy Avenger.

Box of Imps

The square panels of this wooden box have inset hinges
that allow each side to open individually, though only one at
a time. Circles of ornate runes decorate each facing, providing instructions for those who can decipher them. When
someone opens the box and intones the correct command
(as indicated by the symbols on the particular side of the box
being opened), a horde of devilish imps emerges to execute
the order.
Legends claim that an ancient wizard created the box,
imbuing it with the essence of a permanent apportation
spell that summons demonic servants from another plane.
No doubt a series of misadventures parted the box from its
creator and sent it on a long journey through many owners,
some who knew and exploited its true power, and some who
did not and unleashed a unmanageable horde of imps upon
themselves.

Locations
This artifact most likely resides with a potent magician
who can appreciate its power, guard it against misuse, and
employ the imps on various errands. Such personages keep it

locked away in tower closets, subterranean vaults, or treasure
rooms until ready to open it.
The uninitiated who tamper with the Box of Imps inevitably find themselves plagued by bored, pesky, and ill-behaved
imps. Without knowing the proper magical commands to
order them to perform tasks or return them to the box, those
opening panels simply invite a spate of impish mischief upon
themselves. Such owners attract the attention of others
more attuned to such magical artifacts — powerful mages
who can deal with the imps, control the horde, and exploit
their services.
The box may sit neglected as part of a larger treasure hoard,
or might reside in some dusty corner of a library, study, or
magical laboratory, forgotten or misidentified by the current
owner as a simple, inconspicuous box.

Powers
Upon opening the box and speaking the proper command
(and identifying the subject of that command), 4D imps
scamper out of the box. After a brief moment reconnoitering
their situation and receiving additional information from
their controller about the object of their mission, they fly
off to accomplish their task.
Each of the box’s hinged sides has a different set of command symbols carved into its surface. Deciphering the glyphs
requires a Difficult languages/reading/writing roll. Successfully
intoning the runes requires a Moderate apportation roll.
Opening a panel requires no effort. Releasing one side and
uttering the proper command summons the imps and sends
them on one of six missions (depending on the side opened
and the order spoken):
Attack: The horde immediately charges off after a specified target to engage it in combat until dead or they receive
the order to return to the box.
Confuse: The imps disperse to find a subject and confuse
him by altering signs, disguising paths, scattering clues, jamming doors, and otherwise misleading him.
Pester: Similar to the confuse command, pester sends the
imps to harass an individual by more aggressively annoying
him. They break important items, scatter or hide others,
pick at clothing, spill drinks, and otherwise make a general
nuisance of themselves (the principle activity at which they
excel).
Search: The imps spread out in search of a particular item,
person, or place the controller identifies upon summoning
them. After finding it, they return and provide directions for
the user to find it himself.
Retrieve: Like the search command, retrieve sends the
imps on a mission to find a particular item they can collectively gather up and return to the controller. They cannot
move large objects, and they have difficulty restraining live
creatures for very long.
Return: Unlike the others, this panel does not summon
any imps. Instead, they immediately cease their activities

and return to the box, clamoring into it through the return
opening.
(((begin sidebar)))

Box Imps
Box imps stand large enough that only one can exit
the box at a time. The small creatures have leathery
skin, batlike wings, cloven feet, clawed hands, scraggly
limbs, hunched postures, barbed tails, sneaky faces,
and little horns peeking out from mops of black hair.
They do not possess any accoutrements such as tiny
pitchforks, clothes, belts, or tunics. They exist solely to
serve the one who opens the box and properly intones
their command. They speak their own, incomprehensible language of chittering squeaks, though they can
impart simple information though gestures (usually
pointing) or acting out events they have witnessed.
They seem to display a rudimentary intelligence, though
they may hide their true, devilish intellect. When summoned without a clear command, they tend to wander
off exploring, breaking things, and otherwise getting
into trouble.
The following game characteristics use D6 Space
names. Gamemasters using other genres will need to
convert the names and the skill locations.
Box Imp: Agility 4D, brawling 5D, dodge 5D,
flying/0-G 5D, Mechanical 1D, Strength 1D, Knowledge
2D, Perception 2D, search 4D: tracking +1, sneak 5D,
Technical 1D. Move: 4/24 (walking/flying). Strength
Damage: 1D. Body Points: 13/Wound levels: 3. Disadvantages: Hindrance: Shorter Stride (R3), -6 to base Move,
which affects all other Moves; Infamy (R2), everyone
knows imps can only cause trouble. Advantages: Size:
Small (R2), scale value 6. Special Abilities: Extra Body
Part: Barbed Tail (R1); Flight (R3), leathery bat wings
provide flight capabilities; Natural Hand-to-Hand
Weapon: Claws (R1), damage +1D.
(((end sidebar)))

Hazards
Without properly deciphering and intoning the correct
runes for the panel opened, users risk releasing a horde of
imps with no clear orders. Until the owner can lure them
back into the box (by correctly using the return command
and opening that side) or otherwise disperse or destroy them,
the imps plague him as if the user himself were the target of
the pester order. This makes the box extremely hazardous to
those unable to decipher the command runes or successfully
make a Moderate apportation roll to use this artifact.
The imps also carry the stigma of having a notorious
reputation. Anyone spotting the devilish little creatures
immediately knows they’re up to no good, and suspects those
seen summoning them from the box as having malevolent
intentions.

Periwig’s Compass

This antiquated navigation instrument sits in a box about
15 centimeters on a side and about five centimeters deep.
Nautically themed carvings decorate the sides and hinged lid,
with an odd rhyme inscribed on the top: “Spinning compass
I thee tame, point to the place that I now name.” Inside, a
round brass fitting marks the compass points like any other
instrument, though arcane runes denote the points usually
reserved for the four cardinal points. Incremental arrows mark
the degrees in between, and nautical-looking ornamentation
fills the corners. Within this circle, an intricately decorated
needle spins suspended on a pointed cone. The needle lazily
wanders around the compass degrees, never once settling
on a firm direction until the owner intones the command
rhyme carved on the lid and names a person, place, or thing
to which the compass must point.
Periwig, a legendary mage-explorer, crafted the compass
and magically imbued the instrument with his collective
geographical knowledge and navigational reasoning. Doing
so meant spending hours pouring over charts, speaking to
the compass like a colleague, and taking it along on innumerable voyages like a traveling companion meant to experience
everything firsthand. Some believe during this time the
instrument acquired some degree of personality, albeit an
indifferent and sometimes indolent one. The compass served
Periwig well during many expeditions into uncharted regions,
though it became temperamental and eventually led him into
dangerous waters from which he never returned.
The compass is rumored to have a suggested auction price
of Heroic.

Locations
Nobody knows for certain what happened to Periwig’s
compass after the mage-explorer disappeared. Those who
believe he left it behind on that last voyage search the ruins
of his seaside castle, a warren of tunnels, walls, towers, and
wrecked structures that once housed his chart room, study,
library, and observatory. Although many adventurers have
picked over these remains to no avail, others continually
seek the compass there in the hopes it lies forgotten in some
secret chamber previous looters have overlooked.
The instrument may lie buried as part of a hidden trove
on a deserted island, or sit within the wreckage of Periwig’s
ill-fated ship dashed upon distant and strange shores. If discovered, the compass surely passed through many hands and
could remain in the possession of nearly anyone associated
with nautical travel or exploration. It may sit atop a pirate
treasure chest or lie forgotten at the bottom of a sailor’s sea
chest. A navigator or scholar who grew bored or impatient
with the instrument’s moody nature might have tossed it
onto a dusty shelf or beneath a pile of papers.
Given its magical nature, a sorcerer who possesses the
compass would realize its value and keep it well guarded in
a high tower or sealed vault. Those who hear of its powers
seek to gain it by any means, believing the compass will
lead them directly to legendary treasures, lost cities, tombs

of grand heroes, other magical artifacts, and even paradise.
Since the instrument can point to individuals, even those
who constantly travel, bounty hunters particularly hope to
acquire the compass for their own purposes.

Powers
To properly intone the command rhyme requires the
speaker to make a Moderate command roll and name a specific
person, place, or item. The needle immediately points on a
two-dimensional plane (following a planet’s curve) directly
toward the stated object. It does not pay any mind to obstacles
or the easiest routes; the compass simply points the straightest path to the subject. (If unsuccessful, the compass needle
continues its languid meanderings.) Those using it gain a +8D
bonus to all navigation and tracking rolls related to reaching
the object over and around various geographic and artificial
obstructions. The compass has an unlimited range, so users
might not reach the stated objective before time runs out
(see “Hazards” below).
Periwig’s Compass Powers: Sense of Direction (R8),
+8D to navigation and tracking rolls, with Restricted (R2),
rolls must be related to finding a single named target; with
Magically Empowered (R2); Minor Stigma (R1), wearer must
properly recite rhyme; Restricted: Time Limit (R3), only
points to the stated target for 4D hours; and Burn-out (R1),
can be lost or stolen.

Hazards
Although the compass doesn’t necessarily have a mind
of its own, it displays unpredictable behavior like any other
delicate instrument. Nobody’s sure if Periwig designed it
with such idiosyncrasies or if the compass acquired them
through years of use and abuse.
Since the instrument points directly to the stated target,
it does not take into account obstacles — some extremely
hazardous — through, over, or around which one must travel
to reach the intended objective. Inevitably, the compass has
a mischievous knack of indicating a straight path leading
through the most dangerous or troublesome terrain.
The compass points to the specified person, place, or item
for only 4D hours, during which time the owner may not have
sufficient time to reach it over numerous obstacles. When this
period expires, the needle spends one hour gradually veering off course before returning to its indolent meanderings
around the compass points. Noting the original bearing on a
map using a regular compass doesn’t always work — Periwig’s
instrument does not indicate distance to the subject — and
proves problematic for objects that move.
Unfortunately one cannot simply repeat the rhyme and
restate the intended target. The compass only takes one
request per day, regardless of how long it accurately functions.
It also recognizes a stated object only once, though creative
users might try describing the same subject in different ways.
The compass gets bored with long descriptions, so proper
names work best, with more elaborate explanations muddling
its sense of direction. This may lead to some confusion; a new

command roll gauges how successfully the user expresses the
same objective using other words — and thus how accurately
the compass points to the exact same subject.
These shortcomings aren’t always immediately apparent to
users, who often get angry or impatient when the compass
doesn’t seem to work properly. Considering the instrument’s
ancient wooden case and delicate brass workings, one wonders how it lasted so long without some frustrated owner
smashing the compass to bits.

Tomes, Magical and Otherwise
Tome Title: It doesn’t have to be words; it can be a symbol
or a language unknown to player characters.
Description/History: This provides a brief description of the
physical book: size, pages, material used in its manufacture.
It also include information such as if the book was printed or
handwritten. Was the author a sorcerer? An insane scholar?
Or did the volume just appear from nowhere? Optionally, the
number of copies in existence might be included, indicating
if the book is rare or common. Perhaps the text was so foul
that it was burned, leaving only a few copies in existence,
making it a rare find indeed.
Alternately, the book might be a duplicate of the original.
If so, how has it changed from the original? Perhaps some
of the spells or content have been corrupted.
Contents: Spell list. Provide a brief description of the spells
included in the tome. As a suggestion, the gamemaster might
provide alternate spell names. By not revealing the actual
spell names to player, it requires the player’s character to
investigate and decipher the spells during game play.
Tomes can include more than spells, making books valuable
to a wide range of characters. Histories, arcane knowledge,
specialty knowledge can be included in a book. Increasing
skills, learning spells or providing bonuses to skills while
using the book in conjunction with a skill are options.
Skill increases should be kept minimal, and improving skills
from a book requires uninterrupted time. The most powerful
of tomes contains both spells and knowledge.
Protections (optional): Locks, traps or curses protect some
arcane and mundane volumes. List the protections, if any.
Language: Languages should vary with tomes, depending
upon their history. Whether it be Elvish or Latin, a book of
arcane lore or history should utilize language, making the
reading of it all the more difficult, while providing gamemaster
with an adventure hook on occasion.
Reading Period/Difficulty (optional): The Reading
Period of a book varies from days to weeks to months to
years, depending upon the size and level of knowledge being
imparted. This value is usually absolute, such as 16 weeks.
But it can vary, based upon the reader’s languages skill or
Knowledge The use of result points is an option for reading
time. Heroes who exceed the difficulty level of a tome might
have the required Reading Period reduced by an appropriate
number of days, weeks, months or years as decided by the
gamemaster. Similarly, a gamemaster might allow for partial learning. This means a pouring over volume for 3 of the
required 6 weeks provides them with a partial insight into
the contents — perhaps learning some skills or spells but
not all. This is gamemaster’s choice.
