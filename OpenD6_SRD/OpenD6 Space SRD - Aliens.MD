OpenD6 Space Aliens SRD
=======================

Introduction
------------

A worthy band of scouts has traveled the galaxy to bring you 
information on over 30 different types of beings. Some of this 
knowledge was brought to you at great risk. Others were just fun 
to report about.

The entries herein have been divided into three categories.
Hyposapient creatures are of animal intelligence, though
sometimes they seem more clever than most humanoids.
Homosapient beings exhibit features that would classify them
as "sentient” by all but the most arrogant species. Hypetsapient beings 
encompass those entities that are greater than the average sentient 
species. They're not necessarily smarter, but
they are much more powerful.

Each entry offers a typical or example member of the species
in question. Of course, there's great diversity in most life, so you
might not necessarily encounter the exact member detailed in
this book. Some creatures might be more or less powerful than
what's presented here, due to environmental factors, scientific
or metaphysical experiments, age, diet, and so on.

Furthermore, it's possible that you might not meet most
of these creatures; some galaxies are more populated than
others.


What You'll Need
----------------

You'll get the most out of this book if you've already read (or
at least own) the D6 Space Rulebook. However, we've included a
genre conversion at the end of this book for those who'd like to
use these critters in D6 Fantasy or D6 Adventure encounters.


Hyposapients vs. Sentient Beings
--------------------------------

You'll notice that game characteristics are given in one of
two ways: with natural abilities or with Advantages, Disadvantages, 
and Special Abilities. This is to help you distinguish between those 
with animal instincts only (which are the ones with natural abilities) 
and everyone else.


Hyposapient Skills
------------------

Although clever, most animals are not as intelligent as people
are. They don't actively use skills, though they may have some
to represent their unconscious application of them, such as
willpower to resist being told what to do. Animals usually decide
on the best course of action that will lead to their own survival,
unless they are trained otherwise.


Scale
-----

Many of the creatures in this book include a scale value.
(Those that don't have a scale value of zero.) Scale takes into
account that large creatures are easier to hit but harder to injure,
while small creatures are harder to hit but easier to injure. For
information on how to use scale in your combat encounters,
see page 83 of the D6 Space Rulebook.


Increased Attribute Special Ability
-----------------------------------

Some entities have a bonus in parentheses after attributes
and Strength Damage values. This number in parentheses
indicates the modifier that the creature receives from haw
ing the Increased Attribute Special Ability for the related
characteristic.


Disadvantages
-------------

The ellects of the Reduce Attribute and the Hindrance:
Movement Disadvantages have been figured into the charao
teristics of the creatures, so do not apply them again.


Body Points and Wounds
----------------------

The Body Points for each entry were determined by multiplying the 
number in front of Strengths "D” by 3, adding the pips, and adding 10.

All entries in this book have been given three Wound levels (Stunned, 
Wounded, and Severely Wounded). Use the "Wound Levels" chart on page 76 
of the D6 Space Rulebook, dropping Dead to the Incapacitated level. 
Thus, if the creature takes nine or more points of damage or takes a 
fourth Wound level, it's Dead.

In either case, adjust the numbers up for harder-to-harm creatures, 
or down for those that are easy to get rid of.

Note that species packages follow the same rules for determining the 
number of Body Points or Wound levels as the normal character creation 
system for characters.


Designer Creatures
------------------

Those creatures that game masters wouldn't allow players to take as 
characters may have a minimum of 0D in Mechanical and Technical, a 
minimum of 1D in any other attribute (generally Knowledge), but they 
have no attribute maximum. (Note that a 0D in an attribute means 
that the creature may not rely on that attribute or any skill 
associated with it.) Use Disadvantages and Special Abilities as 
inspiration for the game mechanics of various natural abilities for 
the creature. For ideas on designing new intelligent alien species, 
see pages 41-42 of the D6 Space Rulebook. For suggestions on creating
generic people, see pages 123-124.


How to Use the Species Packages
-------------------------------

Species packages may be used with any of the character
creation systems, though they work easiest with the defined
limits or creation points methods.

First decide on the species you want your character to be.
Note the cost of that package.

Those using templates or the defined limits method need
to reduce the number of skill dice their characters start with
by the amount listed in the "Total defined limit cost" section.
If the template does not have enough skill dice to pay for the
package, then you have two options: (1) You can pick another
species that has a lower cost. (2) You can select Disadvantages,
the total ranks of which equal the package cost. (This is also
a good way to get a few extra skill dice.)

Additionally, those creating characters with the defined
limits method may spend attribute dice to buy a species pack-
age. The "Total defined limit cost” section notes how many
attribute dice you must discard to get the package.

Those using the creation points method subtractthe amount
listed in the "Total creation point cost" section.

Regardless of the method that you employ, you also can
pick Disadvantages to offset some or all ofthe species package
cost. Remember that one rank of a Disadvantage equals one
skill die or one creation point.

Note that one species in this book, the Mareen, has a
character package that actually gives extra creation points or
skill dice for choosing them. However, the base package doesn't
allow them any means of getting off their homeworld, so those
extra points are usually spent immediately to give them the
Equipment to do so.

Once you've paid for the package, continue making a
character as normal.

You'll notice that a few ofthe species packages do not follow
the"maximum of 10 Disadvantage ranks” suggestion given in
the rulebook. This is because every Disadvantage (as well as
Advantage and SpecialAbility) has a reason for being there. Of
course, to be a character ofthat species, the player may not choose
to delete or ignore any part of the package (unless specified in
the package). Players who want to design their own characters
inspired by but not exactly like the packages are still limited by
the Disadvantage maximum, unless the gamemaster allows otherwise.

Generally, players taking species packages may only
include up to additional five ranks of Disadvantages or a
number ofranks of Disadvantages equal to the cost of the package, 
whichever is greater. For particularly good roleplayers Whose 
Disadvantages and character concepts are more than simply words 
and numbers on a page, the gamemaster may be more ﬂexible
with these rules.

Players may select only one species package for each char
acter, though they may discuss with their gamemaster ways
to create hybrid packages.


Making Your Own Species Package
-------------------------------

The process of making your own species packages is both
straightforward and challenging.

Step 1: Describe the species, You can find tips and questtions 
on pages 41-42 of the D6 Space Rulebook. If you'd like to generate 
a planet for them, use the system on pages 85-83 of the D6 Space Ships 
supplement. This system also includes entries related to the 
populace of the planet, which can be a useful place to start. 
Likewise, the "Travel and Combat" chapter of that book contains a 
bounty of ideas for space-faring, authorities and regulations.

Step 2: Once you have several key features for your new
species, go through the "Character Options” chapter selecting
Disadvantages, Advantages, and Special Abilities.

Step 3: Determine the species package cost. first, add
together the ranks in the Disadvantages. Then, total the ranks
of the Advantages and total point cost of the Special Abties. 
Then, subtract the Disadvantages from the total of the
Advantages and Special Abilities. If the final number is zero,
the package has no cost. If the final number is more than zero,
than this is how many creation points or skill dice the packs
costs. If the number is less than zero, then this is how many
extra creation points or skill dice the character starts with.

The packages created for this book considered Special Abilities
as uncommon (and thus having each additional ranks cost
same as the first). This is recommended to prevent some abuse
ofthe species packages. 

If the gamemaster chooses to have common Special Alities (where 
additional ranks cost a mere one point each), he sholbe certain 
that the Disadvantages come up frequently during adventures. (The 
gamemaster also it need to refigure any published package costs.)


Step 4: If desired, add artribute minimums or maximums, recommended 
skills, recommended optional Disadvantages, Advantages, and Special 
Abilities, a any other desired notes. This an optional step, but 
one that can force some uniformity in membeers. Remember that, unless 
otherwise specified, all characters attribut must have at least 1D 
(0D for Extranormal attributes), and a maximum of 5D; attributes 
greather than this should be represnted by the Increased Attributes
Special Ability.

Particularly daring tide stalkers have been known to snap

' with bony hooks along their underside. The creatures spring
from the water, grab their prey in their toothy mouths, and
' drag them below the surface to drown.
The sea creatures are capable of such quick and ferocious
attacks because of the series of hooks that run the length of
their body. The unjointecl bony protrusions act as legs for
partial locomotion, pinchers to grasp objects, and stakes to
help them hold their ground.
Tide stalkers earn their name

at in-Hight ships, hoping to clamp on to the craft and pull it
underwater. Once the ship is immobilized, it tears open the

Little has been placed in the Wild without having a niche

no exception to the rule. These creatures serve as unlikely

capable of delivering a terrible bite that saps a persons will.
Thus, many unwary travelers have run into misfortune when

Curiously, at least one doctor has claimed that, through use
of a captive valclusian, she managed to use the creature in the

ineffective treatments to work. Most researchers have scoﬂ'ied

As a result, "haggling” has little meaning to the Dealers,

per se; they offer their wares at the price that they conclude

that amount. However, those who interact frequently with
Dealers realize that Dealers place values on everything, so a

price that seems unworkable can be made more affordable by

the defective rogue, who will then have two options: make all

reparations necessary (with interest) or be deactivated. The
latter outcome is usually performed by the Dealer's parent or,
if unavailable or destroyed, any lowerenumbered Dealer.

Entertainment

Dealers believe that all transgressions can be repaid monetarily;

from breach of contract to crimes of violence, any fault of a
Dealer's can be made whole (to the Dealers, at least) by the
expenditure of money - usually a great deal of money. There

is no "prison” or other punishment to Dealers outside of the
financial ones, although if it is shown that a Dealer has little
probability of repaying such debts, it may be deactivated. The

Dealers have no organized entertainment since, lacking

Despite their technological savvy and industrial society,

legends through various forms of storytelling. Some retain
their time'honored venues as written literature, songs, epic

poetry, and live plays. Gilvahn still enjoy simply sitting around
a good meal regaling each other with entertaining tales. Other
stories use more technological means of dissemination, such
as electronic manuscripts and broadcastholographic presenta-

Gilvahn developed specialized technology to deal with their
homeworld's heavy gravity and hazardous environment, which
naturally expanded to support an industrial economy.

Engineers developed many heat»resistant substances and
have incorporated them into building materials, vehicles, armor,

and clothing. A defense industry initially formed around the
need to equip warriors to eradicate swarming skevvels from

subterranean settlements; it quickly grew to provide ordnance
for protecting factories, mines, and starships from predatory
offlworlders. The Gilvahn battlesnit remains the core equip-
ment Gilvahn soldiers employ today.
Gilvahn maintain a reputation for producing reliable
industrial technology. Many manufacturing corporations
throughout the galaxy purchase refinery furnaces, heavy

assembly plants, power stations, floater vehicles, and
tractorwbeam assemblies from Gilvahn companies.

Construction engineers design buildings and infra
structure to handle heavy industry.
This renown isn't limited to massive factory equip-
ment and vehicles; Gilvahn possess an aﬂinity for

designing small gadgets to aid with technical tasks.
No matter their trade, everyone relies on such user

ful devices as personal data organizers, comm pads,
diagnostic cuffs, and media players. Most Gilvahn
engineers and spacers keep a handy spanner
nearby for assisting with mechanical repairs and
adjustments.

to bore into mineral'rich ores. A wide but focused beam of
superheated plasma turns raw rock into slag that workers can

employ plasma drills mounted on crane gantries or hydraulic
armatures to more freely move about where needed.
Gilvahn miners take particular care around plasma drills,
wearing heattresistant clothing, polarized visors, and heavy

work gloves. Drill teams maintain strict safety protocols to

ensure nobody accidentally becomes caught in the plasma
beam or the resulting ﬂow of molten ore. Each carries a min-
ing impeller, a cylindrical device held at one end and along
the barrel. When directed at loose rock or dirt, the sonic and
gravitational fields emitted from the far end act as a shovel,
clearing channels into which melted ore ﬂows. The second

setting enables the tool to function as a counter-tractor beam
that allows miners to "push" streams of molten rock toward
established troughs and ingot molds.

Starport Ruins: The most substantial indication of earlier Gruemor
civilization stands atop a nearly leveled mountain at the end of a spur range

that penetrates the planet's largest forest. Upon this platform, the Gruemor
constructed a sprawling starport arranged in a radial fashion. Landing pads

crushed many buildings over the centuries, leaving little more than jumbled
wreckage. Given the Gruemor reverence for nature, these dwellings may have
been designed to merge back into the natural terrain after their original use,
making the xenoarchaeologist's job difficult. Our team hopes to find some

chefs constantly test new combinations and new organic sub-

As long as a Gruemor has an every-pot, some water, and

Economy
Without a centralized government, immense industrial
base, or stable homeworld, the Gruemor have little resembling
a viable economy. Individual families get along as best they

can. They depend on their benefactors generosity to survive.
Most hire themselves out for solitary expeditions or as survey
team mission consultants, hoping for liberal pay and bonuses
for good work. Gruemor live from one expedition to the next
on limited funds, with no government to aid them in times
of need.
Gruemor possess very little property; fewer own their scout
ships as had in the past, having sold them to pay biils and rely-

Gtuemor practice no formal religion but harbor a respect

their exploration duties, they do their best to avoid destroying

fall to advancing development.

Most Gruemor keep live plants in their homes {and
sometimes in small terrariums aboard ship) to remind them
of their connection to nature. This foliage comes from the

planet on which Gruemor families have settled and worlds
from which explorers have returned with live specimens for

ﬂnmnsanient Species 7_
An environmental species who've only recently decided

to join the galactic community in the stars, the Hurshuka
constantly strive to balance their devotion to their homeworld
with their need to protect it from potential opportunists,

Physical Annearance
The Hurshuka (as they are known collectively - a singular
member is a"l-iurshuk”) are large bipedalhumanoids, standing
at about three meters tall and weighing around 250 kilograms.
Being coldeblooded, they have no hair or fur, and the gender
dificerences are subtle. Their most noteworthy feature is the
large spilcy protective shell that provides much of their weight
and density.
Hurshuka come in a variety ofcolors, and the coloration of
an individual Hutshuk differs widely throughout its life cycle.
At birth, a Hurshuk is covered in muted greens, grays, and

browns; biologists assume this is to provide a newly hatched
l-Iurshuk some camouﬂage and protection in thewild from the
few predators of Ala'k. Once a Hurshuk reaches maturity, it
undergoes radical alterations in its pigmentation, with bright

the patterns subsume into the larger whole; at this stage, one
or two colors dominate, and the oncevvivid patterns are only
discernible upon close examination.
These colorations are very important to Hurshuka culture,
and they incorporate them into many aspects of their life.
For example, a cowardly Hurshuk might be said to "still have
his hidevhues,” while an elder who has a spark of passion
or quickness about him might be said to have "donned his
mate-stripes."

The Hurshuka homeworld -- called Ala'k (or"Paraclise”)
-- is a swamp world consisting of 65% water, mostly in the
form of lakes and rivers. Its three moons are named Crika,
Rarrak, and EraCrik, which correspond to what the Hurshuka

perceive as the three stages of life: youth, maturity, and old
age. Ala'k is a mildly tropical world, with little variance to its

temperature except at the poles, which are too cold to sup
port Hurshuka life. The Hurshuka speak passionately about
their homeworld, even more so than most other sentients; to
them, it's the pinnacle ofexistence, and the rest ofthe wonders

of the cosmos pale in comparison. (Any comments akin to,

patterns ofstripes, circles, or spots. Males at this stage tend to
be more brightly colored, while females have more elaborate
and intricate patterns, This is how l-lurshuka know that they
are capable ofhaving offspring, and it's still primarily how they
judge beauty among themselves (despite their protestations

lumbering toward the speaker.) Hurshuka have preserved a

final half-century of a l-Iurshuk's life, those colors fade and

can research large swaths that have been kept virtually the
same for millennia.
Although most ofAla'k is undeveloped or underdeveloped,
there are patches that are too far removed from natural water
to be utilized as it is; these areas are called"Ekalatapono'ala'k"
- literally, "the patches of death
and despair that allow us to rec:
ognize the rest as paradise." These
areas alone are the closest that
Hurshuka have to "cities,"

"Er-Crik” stage. If this call is heeded, they are most satisfied
to find a mate within 50 kilometers of their hatching. During
this process, they may need to fight and incapacitate others
of their own gender; males and females alike struggle for
superior mates, especially if they themselves are superficially
less than desirable. Afterwards, the female lays between three

chopping down random trees and setting encampment fires,
the Hurshuka's rage was as unexpected as it was fierce.
Standing over the invaders' corpses, the Hurshuka decided
that they needed to adapt and move outward to the stars. They
did so grudgingly and not without great regret. Their logic
was that, ifthey did not become involved in the interplanetary

This compulsion to pass on the genes strikes some as
unusual, because Hurshuka have almost no attachment to
family otherwise. They do not have a concept of marriage,

inclustrial era.

For the most part, the Hurshuka are fairly peaceful and
content to leave others alone. However, they have a curious
biological trait ___. one that wasn't discovered until they trav-
elecl to other worlds. The Hurshuka are cold'blooded and
remarkably sensitive to changes in temperature. In cold climes
- those below 20 degrees Celsius - Hurshuka become
remarkably morose, sluggish, and almost suicidally depres-

sive. In environments above 32. degrees, they become manic
and much more prone to anger and violence; they also move
around much more rapidly (at least, for a Hurshulca), because
they are trying to "fan” away excess heat. Outside their tem-

perature ranges, their metaphysical abilities also become much
more difficult to harness, probably because of the increased

difficulty in concentrating.
Hurshuka are vegans, and they require twice as much food
as most other species ideally the tasty fruits and foliage
plentiful on Ala'lc. Although they can eat most other types
off-bod, they derive no nutrition from the non-vegetable por-
tions; in fact, it wreaks havoc on a Hurshuk's digestive system,

to the point that some alien space'farers use the phrase "Has

one who desires to be leader, then others may assign someone

This process extends up the ladder; the village leaders decide
among themselves who will rule grand villages, the grand
village leaders decide who will preside over the continents,
and the continental leaders decide who will be the planetary
leader. This ruler is called the"Ola'we," which translates to "the

For the incredibly rare violations oflaws that grossly exceed
ShukarAlm, the matter is brought before a tribal council by

either the wronged or a friend of the wronged if the original
victim is unable to accuse. The accused is presumed guilty,
although the Hurshuka use all means to discern what really

happened (including metaphysical mind'probing or compul)
sions to tell the truth) , The outcome ofall such charges is death
by beheading to either the accuser or the accused, depending on

what is believed. The harsh punishments on all crimes helps to
ensure that most wrongdoing is of an accidental or nonserious
nature, since the punishment on all other crimes is so severe.
Fortunately, a species with aprotective shellseldom has to worry

about manslaughter or most other permanent crimes.

to participate in galactic allairs, yet they are biologically
pulled to remain on their homeworld, Some Hurshuka have
made the adjustment well, primarily those whose colorations
or abilities made them less than successfiil on Ala'k. Some
have even become renowned scientists, security guards, and

diplomats. However, most are much happier with the idea of
remaining on Ala'k rather than traveling the stars. On their
first encounter, a friendly alien race taught them a saying, which
has since found widespread usage among saddened Hurshuka:
"You can't go home again.”

The creation myth ofthe Hurshuka revolves around a goddess named Aim-Huts (or "the Great Female Being"). TheyJ

believe that she was basking in the goodness of the cosmos
when she grew lonely and sought to mate. She came across
Almwl-Iuro ("the Great Male Being”) and as a result laid four

eggs. Only one reached maturity and hatched, forming Ala'k.
The three still-born eggs orbit Ala'k, becoming the moons that
serve as a reminder of how precious life is.
The Hurshuka almost universally praise AlmzHure as
the creator, and worship her as the source of all that is good:

life, health, Ala'k, their metaphysical abilities (which they
call "Kol'ak'' -~ "the Touch"), and so on. They do not have an
organized religion in the way many other alien species have it
- there are no churches, no hierarchy, no rules - but rather
an ever'constant appreciation of Alm-Hure. Philosophy is
underdeveloped by the Hurshuka, because they are fairly laid

back; most attempts to discern the deeper meaning of the
universe end with,"It's all good; praise to Alm'I-iure."

cooking), and walking outside. They like socializing with each1
other, although they tend to rely 0n metaphysical impulses to
discern when others would prefer to be alone. Hurshuka also
enjoy artistic endeavors, although they tend toward mediums
that are either impermanent or have no impact on the environ-
ment. Thus giant statues horrify the Hurshuka sensibilities,
since they see them as unnecessary desecrations of perfectly
beautiful stone, while a song or poem dedicated to the memory
of a Hurshuka hero might be universally praised.
Some Hurshuka who have left Ala'k seem more willing
to adapt to new technology and equipment than others; they
embrace the use of new and non-living devices. Others of the
race have a name for such Hurshuka: "Elit'kol'akelassa." This
phrasetranslates to"those who have been touchedby the ﬂicker-
ing fire” {singular is"Elk'kol'al<;'elass”), and it is how Hurshuka
perceive those who they view as having been hypnotized by
holovids, shiny metal toys, and the like.

When asked whatever happened to Almrl'iuro after the
mating, Hurshuka generally agree that he wandered off, presumably to sleep or get something to eat; they speak of either

Most devices in D6 Space are "ola” by

thus more likely to break on a Critical Failure)

damage normally (see the "Eric-angling” rules
from page 82 of the D6 Space Rulebook for

more information). This is a weapon that
favors the skilled, such that any excess in

a Hurshuka's throwing roll is added to this

The technology ofthe Hurshuka has three broad classifica'
tions: aim, alm'ola, and 0151. These translate to "the great,'"'the
fair (or middle of the pack)? and "the least." The classification
refers to the means used to make the device. Alm devices are
those that are entirely natural, biological, or organic in nature.

Alm'ola equipment comprises of a mixture of organic and

Notes: We drove them off, but as we did...

rEntertainment
The Lonthyn enjoy engaging in activities that highlight
their own subspecies best traits. For the outer-world Lon-
thyn this includes martial arts competitions, foot races, and

and continued trade between the two worlds; the inner-world
Lonthyn don't hold this fact overthe heads oftheir kin, because
they know that, in an outright war, they'd probably lose their

homeworld to the outer-worlders. However, this tie to their
kin's world is a constant source of friction in private outera

"Nyl'il'a" - literally, "l hunt you": a game that combines tag

and stealth as Lonthyn skulk around a city, trying not to be
seen while tagging sensorlvests worn by other players with
shots by a lightlbased gun. Nyl'il'a is particularly exciting
because it skirts the edges of legality; while a declared game
of Nyl'il'a falls within the purview of Ilyaye'il, good games of

Nyl'il'a can last for several days or longer, and it's a legal gray
area if outsiders become hurt on the fifth day of an event if it
was only declared publicly on the first day.

world chambers.
The Lonthyn Cocktail has a cost of Very Easy (five cred~
its) for outer'world Lonthyn, primarily because its expense
is heavily subsidized. The Lewa'aln normally is not sold by

Lonthyn to non«Lonthyn (for one thing, it has no effect on
most humanoids), and as such could only be obtained on the
black market at a Very Difficult cost (9,400 credits).
Lonthyn Braces: Another common technological item of

The innerrworld Lonthyn prefer more cerebral events,

the Lonthyn is the braces worn by the inneriworld Lonthyn

especially those that show cunning or intellect: debate, puzzle
contests, andimpromptu invention competitions called"Loll'il"
("I make”) where participants must come up with a solution to
a problem using a stock set of seemingly unrelated parts.
Both subspecies have a solid eye for art that many outsiders
find surprising; children are taught history and appreciation

when off their homeworld. Although better technology is

for all types of artistic endeavors, and artist is a perfectly valid

career path (provided the Lonthyn is any good, of course).
Lonthyn artistic styles tend to evolve much more rapidly than
in other cultures, with full-ﬂedged movements erupting every
decade or two and submovements evolving every other year
or so. Some xenobiologists posit that the Lonthyn's artistic
appreciation comes from an understanding oftheir own frailty
within the cosmos; however, these scientists keep their musings
to themselves, lest the proud Lonthyn take offense,

available, their pride keeps them from crafting anything more
than the minimum framework necessary to protect their frail
skeletons. The notion ofan innerwvorld Lonthyn in a powerful
exoskeleton is abhorrent to Lonthyn; the inneraworlders would
see it as denying their genetic destiny and the outeraworlders
would View it as a poor substitute for their in-born technology.
Besides, the Lonthyn braces have been designed not to interfere
with the natural agility and quickness that most inneraworld

Lonthyn possess. Lonthyn braces provide an Armor Value of
+2. Cost: Moderate (860 credits).
Dagger Forge:This device, one ofthe Lonthyn's bettertkept
secrets, frequently is carried by outeravvorld Lonthyn on covert
missions. It's a tube made of ceramics and advanced plastics,
about 0.75 meters long by 10 centimeters in diameter. It is

often packed with putty and disguised when not in use. The

liquid, turning it into a dagger almost as hard as steel (+1D
damage). The dagger remains solid for 12 hours, after which
time the chemicals holdingit together break down and it reverts
to a puddle of blood, The biggest advantage of this device is
that it is virtually undetectable with normal sensory methods
(Legendary search roll to detect with any sensory equipment),
so a Lonthyn agent will have access to a reasonable blade even
in environments when a notweapons policy is in force. Using
this device costs five Body Points or one Wound level, and
it takes two rounds for such a blade to fully congeal. Cost:
DiH-icult (4,461 credits).

or otherwise, the inner'wotld Lonthyn gave birth to a race
that perfectly complemented their own, in regards to martial

pursuits, Of course, some scholars note that their combative
personality -~ at least, since they became part of the inter-
stellar community - may have evolved from having such a

complement.
Lonthyn Cocktail (Lewa'aln): The outeraworld Lonthyn
have had their skeletons reinforced genetically and artificially
to provide them with heightened speed and durability; their
blood is infused with an advanced nanotechnology that provides

them with quickness and increased strength. This improved

skeletal structure dampers their natural eye»hand coordina»
tion somewhat, making it more difficult for them to utilize
their martial abilities, but most agree it's worth the trade-03s.

The Lonthyn usually disguise their scouting ships as basic
and welleused freighters. Like the Lonthyn themselves, the
exterior hides its deadly and calculating true purpose.

Probably the biggest side eflect ofthe genetic manipulation for
the Lonthyn is the need for Lewa'aln A the ”Water of Life."

business somewhere.
With the March solar system in such a central location on

the space lanes, most of the system's 10 planets and dozens
of planetoicls, moons, and major asteroids have some sort of

settlement on them.
Underneath the water of March, the Mareens have a
vast civilization. Despite the Mareen's nomadic nature, most
Mareens have settled into small cities, a necessity to ensure

growth of Mareens industry and culture. Each city is usually
the home to five to 50 ancestral school units.
Cities are interconnected by magnorails. These magnetic

cities. Exoskeletons and cargo haulers are placed'bn line" with

The primary governing body ofthe Mareen lifestyle is that

every individual votes on issues related to that school. Each
Mareen usually belongs to halfa dozen schools - ones focus'

their nonwork interests. Membership in multiple schools also

helps the Mareen feel he is standing out horn other individur
als. When these schools come into conflict with one another,
each Mareen must choose his own path.

those objects look good, too. Social scientists have theorized
that the Mareen's desire to decorate their exoskeletons and their
lust for interesting objects is their overzealous way ofattempting
to fit in with regular society. Others suggest that each Mareen
is desperate to be different from his peers, since each Mareen

otherwise has no distinctive physical difference.
While material possessions are ofgreat value in the Mareen
culture, intelligence and hard work are also prized --- just not

fact, without the proper upgrades, Mareen exoskeletons aren't
suitable for use in the void of space, since they rely on drawing
in oxygen through air filters, which diffilse the oxygen into the

Mareen's water solution inside her life chamber. Luckily, most
Mareen exoskeleton fits easily within almost any humanoid-
sized spacesuits. (The air'pump system does allow the Mareen
exoskeleton to function in the water without any penalties.)
While in her suit, a Mareen sups on a nutritious mash, which
she easily refills from stores via a special tube. This nutrient

paste is usually a salty mush with a high amount of protein
mixed in with a vegetable matter. Outside its exoskeleton and
in the water, a Mareen usually eats small fish and plants.
Some Mateens with very specific job duties use special
vehicles, such as cargo haulers, military vehicles, or space ships
instead of suits. These vehicles are meant exclusively to be
operated by Mareens, and mest humanoids cannot use them,

Still other Mareens run robotic factories or farms. These
highly skilled Mareens have learned to maintain and operate

Modern transports enable them to bring herds or wool in bulk
to commercial centers or the planet's starport, Gateway Port.
Interaction with oif'worlders have given the Pherro exposure

to the greater galaxy.They've acquired their own system defense
ﬂeet and organized a volunteer militia to protect themselves
and their homeworld against threats. Pherro take an active
part in intergalactic commerce, trading their natural resources

such as kavaam wool, woven fabrics, and automated looms in

exchange for commodities to benefit their own society. The
promise ofa future among the stars also influenced generations

of young Pherto, who satisfied their wanderlust joining ship
crews in search of adventure and fortune before settling down

on Shaphast or in one of the many Pherro herding enclaves
throughout the galaxy.

Gateway For!
Gateway Port serves as the main liaison point between
Pherro and Olfeworlders. The most cosmopolitan city on the
planet provides most of the amenities and services offered in
any other starport in the galaxy. Several institutions promote
Pherro industry and commerce, encouraginginterstellartraders
to help bolster the economy.
To minimize consumption ofpotential grazingground, the
starport covers a vast hilly region in the shadow of a nearby
mountain range. Leveled and reinforced hills serve as landing
platforms, while the city proper rises on the mountainous
high ground. Most travelers spend their time visiting several
key sites.
Off-worlder District: Beyond the docking platform hills
stands the neighborhood catering exclusively to the needs of
visitors, spacers, and merchants. Here they find accommodations ranging from luxury hotels to large boarding houses
offering simple rooms. Restaurants and shops feature food,
goods, and services from Shaphast and around the galaxy.
The planet's permanent offvworlder population settles here,
giving the entire quarter the atmosphere of any intergalactic
city Both off-worlders and Pherro interacting with visitors
offer an affable attitude with an eye toward providing the best
goods and services at a fair price.
Kavaam Exchange: Trade in kavaam and raw wool takes
place in the immense, domed Exchange. Here, traders seeking
to export the herd beasts or large quantities oftheir shorn shag
negotiate with local and galactic agents. The entire floor reeks
ofthe creatures and the pungent scent ofuntreated wool. Pad-

docks separate different sellers herds, while raised platforms
display heaped bales ofshag from different communities. Sellers
graze ﬂocks going to market in the high mountain pastures
and open plains nearby, driving them through the starport
streets to the Exchange on sale days.

Weavers' Emporium: A long, covered avenue serves as the
central marketplace for finished goods manufactured from
kavaam wool. Weavers from across the planet rent arched
bays on each side of the street where they display their wares
for sale to individual visitors or traders seeking to export bulk

quantities.Warehousesbehind each arcade stallstore additional
stock. Typical woven goods include kavaam woven coats (see

. Kavaami'wm'en Goal?
The kavaam woven coat stands as the universal Pherro
garment. This longvtailed coat covers the wearer from
shoulders to the knees, with a mantle that can be raised
as a hood to fend off chills. Pherro weave the fabric
from kavaam wool in such a manner that it insulates
against cold and allows air to circulate to alleviate heat
in warmer climes. Chemical treatment makes the fabric
wateraresistant. Embellishments include dying the wool
in fashionable colors and sewing decorative embroidery
along the collar, cuffs, and hem.
When fully closed, the coat allows the wearer to ignore
the detrimental effects of environmental heat or Cold for
2D hours. It does not provide any armor protection in
combat, nor does it alleviate the effects of sudden term
perature changes, such as those caused by explosions,
ﬂamethrowers, or magma.

Most Pherro on Shaphast or in offaworld enclaves
own two coats, one for everyday wear and another, well-
decorated one for special occasions. Spacefaring Pherro
eschew these coats as impractical garments in starship

environments, though they packapersonalblanket woven

Pherro Spacers Agency: This extension of the Pherro
Starfarers Academy matches qualified Pherro pilots, navigators,

gunners, engineers, loaders, and mercenaries seeking passage
off planet with spacer crews who have vacancies to fill. Most
academy graduates sign up with the agency to quickly findjobs
that take them offplanet and around the galaxy to satisfy their
wanderlust. Starship captains who want to fill open positions
on their crew or hire additional crewers contact the agency
knowing the institution accredits only Pherro who've passed
the academy's rigorous training programs.

The entire Razithar economy depends on conductingtrade
with other markets throughout the galaxy. They do not pro«
duce any bulk commodity of such value to sustain profitable
sales, but they excel at buying, selling, trading, marketing, and

transporting other people's goods to viable markets.
The principle shipping corporations maintain their own
warehouses, docking facilities, merchant ﬂeets, security forces,

and administrative offices. Most specialize in dealing with
particular commodities or conducting trade in specific regions

of space. Central offices on Murrg control overall operations,

viduals or factions can create Razithar with an emphasis
other than mercantile.
Razithar go to great lengths to protect their economic
interests. Merchant cruiser crews and shipboard marines
serve both as traders and soldiers. In times of war, they

form the first rank of defense. A galactic conﬂict could
easily spur an increase in cruiser production and Met»
chant Academy graduates eager tojoin the fight. Razithar
security personnel receive training to deal with many
situations, from guarding facilities and escorting cargoes
to aggressively sabotaging and even openly combating
trade rivals.

Merchant ﬂeets typically ply established space lanes
and call at ports where they can buy and sell valuable
commodities. Occasionally they set out on expeditions
into uncharted territory to explore new routes and find

new consumers. They undertake such surveys with the
same fervor that they pursue any potentially profitable
endeavors. Such explorers do not care much for 1min;

habited worlds or those with rich natural resources; they
seek ready markets for goods, and sources of finished
commodities to trade elsewhere.

Although the existing Razithar economic structure
borders on the criminal, some shipping corporations,

tradingenclaves, or merchant vessels may actually operate
as truly illegal enterprises. Renegade companies with no
representation in the Corporate Domemightgo intobusia
ness for themselves, without the backing and protection of

a species'wide government. Other legitimate businesses
could front subsidiaries dealing in criminal activities to
boost their profits in lawless regions of the galaxy.

on economic theory and the politics ofgreed receive any
degree of respect; even then, their continued existence
relies on how well their philosophies and theories increase

while enclaves throughout the galaxy directly supervise business in their territories.
Each company sends a small delegation to the Corporate
Dome, the principle ruling body for Razithar concerns. Here
they set standard trade policies, sanction those who work
against their profitable activities, and prepare strategies to
better solidify their hold on the overall galactic economy. Most
decisions rely on data compiled by the Exchange, which moni/
tors all trade activity among the corporations. The assembly
elects a triumvirate of chief delegates to act as representatives
to both Razithar and oﬂfvworld concerns in all political and
economic dealings.

Merchant "0815
A profitable economy depends on an armada of armed
merchantcruisers transporting and disseminatinggoods among
diiferent markets. Each Razithar corporation maintains its
own ﬂeet, which they deploy singularly, in pairs, or as convoys
depending on their territory and cargo.
Merchant cruisers form the backbone of any company's
ﬂeet. These massive vessels carry enough cargo space, armor,
shields, and ordnance to transport and defendvaluable freight.
A cruiser's stall:helps it stand on its own, especially in unknown

or hostile territory. The crew includes spacers necessary to
operate all the crafts systems, negotiators and analysts, load;

ers and cargo handlers, marines and infantry, and at least one
adjudicator from the Razithar Equitable Court.
Support vessels such as tenders, maintenance hulks, snub

fighters, and shuttles all ensure the protection and smooth
operation of the cargo cruisers. Some operate out of enclaves
used as merchant cruiser bases. Others, particularly fighter
craft and some shuttles, occupy docking bays in the vessels
themselves.

Most cruisers operatefrom enclaves establishedthroughout
the galaxy by Razitl'lar corporations. They EOIIQW routes that

allow themto maximize their profit bypurchasing commodities
at low costs and selling them on other worlds where increased
demand brings higher prices. Some companies specialize in
trade routes across several sectors to diversify their salable
merchandise. Cruisers plying more remote regions deal in
many different commodities, bringing a wide range of goods
to planets that have little regular contact with freighters from
any galactic power.
A few merchant cruisers operate as privateers, preying on
freighters of unfriendly trade competitors. Disabling andloot-

ing other cargo haulers provides the bulk oftheir merchandise
for sale, though such tradersprefer dealingon backwater worlds
or with crime syndicates that have vested interests profiting

from pirate activity.

Physical Annearance

Homeworlﬂ and colonies

The Verdendrian is a wholly efficient and logically structured

being, biologically speaking. Their bodies consist of a central
body, or pod, which is vaguely ovular and approximately one
meter tall. The pod is covered in a thick layer ofleafy structures
that are tightly packed together and make a sturdy skin. Inside
the pod is somewhat like a fruit, containing a complex set of
pathways in which simple sugars and proteins flow. Here is

Where the brain resides, at the center of the pod.
Sprouting from the pod are eight vinelike tentacles, each
about 0.8 meters in length, four of which are used as legs and
four used for arms. Each tentacle has a set of cilia at the end,

which can be used for fine manipulation, grasping, or support.
The tendrils also form the initial digestive tract, absorbing
nutrients like roots. In addition, there is a single, small head,

copulate and produce seedlings that looklike small pods. Each

coupling results in two to four seedlings, though typically 25%

A visit to thelush world ofVerda has its own specialdelights
and perils. Theplanet is quite beautiful, littered with rainforests
containing flora of every color and intriguing fauna. However,
several ofthe plants are extremely poisonous to many human;
oids; before approaching them, a botanistshould be consulted.
More importantly, as the carnivores of Verda do not care to
eat the Verdendrians themselves, the animals are generally
free to roam Wherever they wish. Visitors have known to be

mauled by a Verda Prowler in starports, museums, and even
in medical facilities, though, in all fairness, the occurrence of
such incidents is somewhat rare. Predators are far more likely
to ambush those in a park or zoo (which to the Verdendrians
are much the same thing).
The cities of Verda are rather unique in comparison to the

sensory nodules. The bud is directly connected to the brain
via a short stem. If lost, the tentacles and the bud can fully

ance. They can walk on as little as two tentacles and can stand
on one. If knocked over, the tentacles typically used as arms
can fimction as legs. In fact, a Verdendrian can reeorientate
himself quickly if turned on end, and they perform equally
well upside down. Tentacles that are not engaging in activity
typically wave gently and are indicators of body language.
The bud houses all of the senses of a Verdendrian aside
from touch, which is strongest in the cilia and tentacles. Their
sensory range is dilferent from most species. They see colors
and have a highly developed sight in the ultraviolet spectrum.
This makes some of their art difficult for many races to per-
ceive, much less appreciate. Their sense of hearing is poor, and
they possess no vocal cords. They communicate via a series of

scent glands on the bud and have perhaps the most developed
sense of smell ofany sentient species known. Their peripheral
vision, due the size of the body versus the budastem, is poor,

but they can often smell other creatures coming as if they had
eyes in the back of their pods.
They prefer to eat vegetation that's fallen off of the main
plant. They're indifferent to carnivorous eating habits, but they

they look like auburn fields of crops. Their buildings are
based on plant structures: tall, lean, having branches that
interconnect with the branches of many of the surrounding

and terrain. Navigating a city on Verda is not very difficult,
though some get confused by the similarities in buildings. In
fact, no two structures are the same, but the differences are
not often considerable.
The Verdendrian colonies are silvery much like Verda itself:
green, heavy rainfall, and warm climate. The Verdendrians do
not care to try to bend nature to their will through terraforme
ing or conquer the elements via technology. Planets that do
not naturally have a strong water supply, good soil, and ample

sunlight are studied but not settled. This has allowed some spe-
cies, friendly to the Verdendrian government, to colonize some
of the harsher worlds closer to Verda that may sustain life.

Sonia!!!
The Verdendrian society is founded on their family
structure. Families, oruRoots,” are comprised of hundreds of
members who live in the same dwelling. Their unity is based
on historical and genetic bonds. A Root typically has a name
for the place its ancestors came from.
For example, the "Root of K0” originates from the forest
known as K0 in the western hemisphere. On modern Verda

J

Notes: Interesting species to talk with.

and in her colonies, many Verdendrians have transplanted
themselves; thus a "Root of K0” in many communities. If a
member of the "Root of K0" must leave one city to work in
another city, he will typicallyjoin the"Root of K0” in the new
city. In the rare instance that his Root is not in the new city,
the individualjoins 3. Root ofhis new co-workers. Sociologists

from other species often classify at Root as a clan more than a
family, but the Verdendrians do not make a distinction.
Individual naming conventions always carry the Root
name as the suﬂix. The prefix of the name is generally one
or two syllables, and they are very simple; examples for the
Root of K0 would be DiKo, JuRiKo, NeKo, TuLaKo, and

so on. Verdendrians do not introduce each other; they do so

individually.
Within a family unit, the adults and elders take turns car!
ing for the seedlings and adolescents, including all preliminary

education. As the young grow, the caregivers evaluate their
potential and, at a certain stage oftheir development, they are
apprenticed to Root members of like abilities. For example,
the education of a Root adolescent showing aptitude in sci!
ence is taken over by a family member who is a scientist. The
mentoring continues until they are adults and are ready to work

outside the Root {if they so desire). Adulthood is achieved at
approximately 25 solar years.

The life of a Verdendrian is purposeful and well defined"
Once in a profession, they rarely change their vocation ”- only
their assignment or project. No job is considered beneath
another. While planetside, they spend most of the day of their
30»hour cycle workingor caring for the young, dependingupon
the needs of the community at large. At night, they become
dormant to save energy and finish processing food, much like
sleep. They can adapt to other "sleep" cycles as needed. Little
changes over the years.
When they die, they are ground up and placed into the soil
ofthe nursery oftheir Root, to nourish the seedlings. Moreover,
anything that dies is used as fertilizer, including animals and
deceased aliens. Any body, which is not quickly claimed by
visitors, is mulched and added to the soil of a nearby Root.
Even when encountered offworld, a group ofVerdendrians may
ask locals ifthey can eat their recently deceased friend. This is
probably because the biO'gel rations of Verdendrian ships are
considered to be satisfactory but hardly ﬂavorful.

Due totheVerdendrian scent'based communication system,
dealings with them have been difficult. Their scent bursts are
largely incomprehensible to all but a handful ofspecies.At best,
a range of scents can be understood to indicate a broad topic.

The elecdrones are one ofthe most fearsome threats faced in
the galaxy, mostly because none ofthe conventional rules ofwar
apply. As far as the best sapient minds have been able to discern,
they cannot be conquered, they cannotbeappeased, they cannot
be reasoned with, and they seemingly cannot be stopped.

Physical Annearance
'lhe Elecdrone Swarming received their name after a
small group of them were discovered on a world. The explor»
ers emerged victorious after a brief battle, and the deceased
specimens were brought back to the scout ship. Examination
showed the creatures to be an amalgam ofelectronic and bio-
logical components; these were no mere cybernetic implants,
but rather a fullrﬂedged integration ofthe parts into the whole
on the cellular level. Since the creatures seemed to be mind»
less creatures, they were given the name "elecdrone,'' short for
"electrical drone."

A second visit to the planet revealed that these creatures
were more common than thought, and another pitched battle
resulted in the explorers ﬂeeing. At this point, the creature's
classification and name were changed to represent their large
numbers, and they became known collectively as the'elecdrone
swarmf'Shortly after this firstencounter, the full magnitude of
the creatures' danger became clear; within a year, three worlds
outlying from that system were overrun by elecdrones. Thus a
new nomenclature was required; while elecdrone refers to one
and swarm refers to many, the "elecdrone swarming" came to
mean the entire threat these creatures pose.

wounded elecdrone is equally likely to spurt ichor, emit
sparks, or do both at the same time. The typical elecdrone
is a radial five-limbed creature, making it resemble an odd

star; its appendages provide both mobility and a means of
attack and manipulation. Although sizes vary considerably,
the typical elecdrone is about one meter across. The greater
threat, however, is the elecdrone generator, a'gueen" of sorts.
"his being much more closely resembles a humanoid, in that it
has a face, eyes, and mouth. However, the rest of its oversized

grotesque body exists solely for the purpose of creating more
of its brood. It's believed the generator cannot move on her
own, so her lair is always surrounded by dozens or hundreds

(or more) of elecdrones.

IKIIIIWII llistnrv
Almost nothingis known about the history ofthe elecdrone
swarming. Experiments on what seem to be their combination
brain/ databanlts have yielded only tantalizing clues that were

probably copied over from successive generations. These frag
ments seem to indicate that the first elecdrones were made as
a solution to a great threat: of some kind. Their selfareplicative

nature allowed for them to continue working long after their
opponents succumbed to the onslaught. Unfortunately, the
fact that there doesn't seem to be any way ofdeactivating them

(at least, not all ofthem all at once) means that they probably
ran amok after defeating their foe, leading to the scourge that
they are today.
Ifthis story has any merit,it leads scholars to ask two disturb-

ing questions. first, what alien spe-
ties would be capable of creating a
threat such as this; the combination

Once the Spool has a safe

it tries to "recruit" other members
of its area, controlling them in the

After the Spool has encugh victims

What these plans are depends
on the individual Spool, The biggest
goal most Spool have is to repro-
duce. The Spool do this by infusing
a victim with a draft of their blood,
either orally or injected. These victims

- whom the Spool consider fortw

Rather, only those with the greatest

abilities to sense such individuals. In
situations where a suitable victim
is not available, someone with

high intelligence is chosen instead.

This emphasis on reproduction stems from the Spool's

The Enemy Within
The biggest problem with lighting the Spool is that there
is no enemy to fight; indeed, it is quite possible that a victim
doesn't even know she has been taken over by the Spool. Howl
ever, there is one"ace" that sentient minds have in combating
this threat: Each individual Spool has some kind of weakness
that allows a person (or people) to break free from their hold
for at least a few minutes at a time.

limitless in their power, perhaps they avoiddoingcertain things
because they know the risks associated with the Curse are too
great; the magnitude of the Curse does seem directly proportional to the extent they are tapping the Thayarr field.

The first limitation is that the Thayarr seem to be unable to
act beyond the scale or range of a star system. They prefer to
"fly” from system to system, although they often teleportwithin
a system. Likewise, they seem unable (or unwilling) to observe
anything outside ofa systemwide scale, except for macro events.
Thus, ifthereis an interestingstellarphenomenonhappening in
a system, the Thayarr favor being at least as close as a terrestrial
vessel studying the same phenomenon, if not closer.
Those scholars who propose that the scope ofthe Thayarr's

are afraid they will "miss” seeing something interesting if they

less ofthe enlightenment (or lack thereof) of the test subjects.
The purpose behind these lessons is unknown. There are two

unwilling) to modify the minds of a sentient being directly;

The second limitation is that the Thayarr seem unable (or
working theories among more philosophical species. The first
is that the Thayarr are attempting to guide "lesser" beings to
some altered state - perhaps a raised awareneSS that is akin

to the Thayarr itself, or at least a precursor. The second theory
is that the Thayarr enjoy the enlightenment that comes from
watching others struggle; this premise posits that the Thayarr
would rather be the ones achieving additional insight, but at
their current state such is impossible."Who can test those who
test?" one quick-thinking captain asked a Thayarr one time,

which caused him to disappear with a slight huff. (The third
View - that theyjust enjoy making sentients scurry like ants
m is too nihilistic to contemplate.)
Some scientists believe that the second, and perhaps greater,
motivation for the Thayarr's interaction with humanoidsis that
they may somehow be instrumental in removing the Curse,
either from an individual Thayarr or from the entire species.
To that end, the Thayarr may request humanoids to turn over

an interesting object they have found, or report on a locale they
visited. There have even been accounts of humanoids being

asked to perform tasks, such as keeping an orbitingspacestation
safe for a week; whether these were tasks designed to help the

Thayarr in some way --- or merely another of their tests that
the victims couldn't understand -- is unknown.
Regardless, it seems that whatever force has instilled the
Curse has also ensured that the Thayarr are unable to remove it
themselves. Ofcourse,whenever the subject ofthe curse arises,

they do not cause someone to do something they are unwilling to do. Thus, a Thayarr has never forced someone to kill
another or commit suicide. There are some ways around this

limitation; for example, the Thayarr may amplify everyone's
emotions tenfold, making someone who normally would not
act on murderous rage suddenly turn into skillet. (The Thayarr
might then argue that he was trying to prove a point about the

potential lurking beneath everyone's surface.)
Third, the Thayarr seem to require concentration in much
the say way that sentient beings do. Hence, it's possible to
overwhelm a 'lhayarr with too many decisions or required
actions. The threshold seems to be about five simultaneous
activities or observations. Of course, five actions at a time for
a near'omnipotent being is still a lot.

finally, the Thayarr seem unabletoprovide clear answers to
future events. They can oifer excellent projections and guesses,
but it seems that's all they can do; they can still be surprised,
sometimes by physical phenomena but usually by sentient

actions and decisions. Perhaps this is another application of
the Uncertainty Principle, where tapping the Thayarr field to
see the future will necessarily change it enough to make those
observations worthless.
Regardless of these limitations, the Thayarr are still one of

the mostpowerful, anddangerous, forces in theuniverse. Anyone
who encounters one of these beings should tread lightly.

EXEIIIIIIB mavarr

humanoid philosophers often nervously ask one question:
Constant, a relatively young Thayarr, hypothesizes that
Would removing the Curse make the Thayarr less obnoxious,
or is that the only force keeping their pride in check?

PBWBI'S
All the Thayarr's special abilities come from their access

of the Thayarr field. Although they claim to be omnipotent,

all creative processes in the universe -- as in, those involving
the act of creating - can be boiled down to one irrational
number, which she calls "the ultimate constant.” To that end,
Constant observes all manner of phenomena, ranging from
galactic formations to new species being born to sentients'
