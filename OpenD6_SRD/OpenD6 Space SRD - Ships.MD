OpenD6 Space SRD -- Ships
=========================


Introduction
------------

The galaxy's calling to you. Ancient artifacts to ﬁnd, untouched
worlds to explore, raiders to defeat, military to outwit.

Got a craft to travel the depths of space? Then start in chapter 1,"Travel 
and Combat." In this section, you'll get details, including game mechanics, 
on what happens in inhabited systems. You'll ﬁnd out about chartering 
a ship (in case yours breaks down), how the law might deal with you, 
and how to handle your ship in a ﬁght.

Should you be looking to upgrade or replace your ship -- or
you need to get a new one -- go for the custom model and create
your own with chapter 2, "Revised Ship Design." With greater
ﬂexibility, this chapter offers three related ship design guidelines,
more modules, more weapons, and more options. Follow all of
the steps for detailed ship creation, or use the information as
inspiration for your own freeform ships.

If those options aren't enough, chapter 3, "Quirky Ships,"
shows you how to include Disadvantages, Advantages, and
Special Abilities in your vessel to make it truly unique. (Gamemasters 
may also ﬁnd this section helpful for adding ﬂavor to
used ships that the players' characters want to purchase.)

Chapter 4,"Example Ships," gives well over a dozen different
basic ships, including sample images and examples for each type
of ship design guideline. You can use them as they're presented,
or modify them to suit your needs.

Of course, with a ship, you need something to do with it.
In chapter 5, "Adventures in Space," you'll ﬁnd out just what's
waiting for you. There're tons of adventure seeds, plus details on
gearing campaigns toward speciﬁc types of characters, including
pirates and the military. If you're not sure what kind of ship you
want, this is a great place to get some ideas.

Chapter 6, "Planet Creation," supplements chapter 5 and
provides gamemasters with the means of quickly creating planets
for their players' characters to explore.

For those who'd like to add space travel to their D6 Adventure games, 
chapter 7 includes a conversion between that genre
and D6 Space.

The book ends with a handful of templates, including one
for advanced ship design, one for freeform ship design, and one
for planet creation.

Though broad in its scope, this book is slanted toward the
space opera subgenre, but gamemasters may include equipment
restrictions, additional action modiﬁers, and other details as
appropriate for their setting.


Travel and Combat
=================

What's in this Chapter
----------------------

This chapter contains information on getting around the
galaxy and game rules to guide gamemasters in simulating many
situations that arise aboard spacecraft.


Galactic Travel
---------------

Getting around the galaxy presents a major challenge in space
campaigns. Unless characters stick it out dirtside on one planet
the entire story arc, they'll eventually need some transport off
world. Some campaigns revolve around space travel, while others 
simply use it to convey heroes from one adventure setting
to another. Spaceships provide a means of journeying from one
system to another. They can enable or limit mobility depending
on their availability and the heroes' funds. The following sections 
cover various means by which characters might engage
in galactic travel.


Your Own Ship
-------------

Characters prefer having their own ship. This increases their
mobility in pursuing proﬁt, exploring new worlds, and ﬂeeing
adversaries. It encourages freedom of activity and offers more
options throughout the campaign.

Unfortunately spacecraft ownership comes with its own burdens: 
vessels cost vast amounts of money, repairs are expensive,
and the investment is constantly at risk. Often the action revolves
more around keeping the ship operational than achieving other
story objectives. Before handing heroes a starship, gamemasters
should choose the circumstances surrounding their acquisition
of a vessel. How characters obtain their own craft affects the rest
of the campaign, establishes their motivations, and determines
their adversaries and allies.

* Purchase: The heroes somehow have enough credits to
outright purchase a small, lightly armed vessel, with no debt
to anyone other than galactic lending institutions. They must
still earn enough money to pay for its operation, and they must
determine how to use it to further their own goals.

* Repair Project: Someone managed to save up to buy a
junk ship, then spent every credit and spare hour working to
repair it as a labor of love. Although it's barely operational, the
systems constantly break down and require an unceasing ﬂow of
credits, maintenance, and replacement parts. Every adventure a
different system goes oﬄine, and the characters must earn more
credits for repairs.

* Inheritance: A relative bequeaths a vessel to a character,
possibly with strings attached (avenge an old wrong, destroy
an enemy, win a race, ﬁnd a lost possession, discover and name
a new planet). An additional monetary inheritance might cover
operational expenses, or the heroes might have to put the ship
to work earning credits to pay for fuel and maintenance.

* Wealthy Patron: A rich eccentric gives the heroes a craft.
Gamemasters should determine whether the patron requires the
characters to undertake some task or fulﬁll some nonmonetary
obligation to retain possession of the vessel (see the suggestions
under "Inheritance"). He may occasionally require them to
transport him to obscure and dangerous regions of the galaxy
to pursue his own mysterious agenda.

* Corporate Craft: The characters work for a small shipping
company, transport line, or other business that allows them
to operate a spacecraft for corporate purposes. Although the
company pays most justiﬁable expenses, the heroes must dodge
aggressive corporate competitors and pirates. Can these heroes
achieve their own goals (even if simply staying out of trouble)
with a ship that really isn't theirs?

* Loan Shark: To purchase their ship, the characters borrowed
money from a less-than-legitimate lending institution -- a
wealthy but corrupt executive, seedy entrepreneur in dubious
industries, or politician with funds to bankroll his secret 
agenda -- with no qualms about roughing up debtors. Although the
heroes have some freedom in using their ship (and earning
enough money to pay off the loans used to buy it), they often
ﬁnd themselves pressured to undertake devious assignments
for their lending patrons.

* Crime Syndicate: The characters gain their ship through
association with a criminal organization. This variation combines
the worst parts of ﬂying a corporate craft and using funds from a
loan shark. Perhaps the characters borrowed money from a crime
boss and must earn each payment under pressure of unpleasant
reprisals. They might actually work for the syndicate (much as if
they had a corporate craft), undertaking smuggling runs, dealing
in illegal goods, and dodging authorities.
Shipjacking: Truly desperate characters might steal their
own vessel, usually during an adventure centering on the theft.

Besides struggling to pay for fuel and maintenance, the outlaws
must also constantly ﬂee law enforcement officials and the ship's
original owners while pursuing their own objectives.

It's My Ship!
-------------

Sometimes a starship owner starts insisting on doing
things her way just because she owns the vessel. She makes
decisions based on the safety of the ship and its proﬁtable
operation rather than the desires or motivations of her
crew and the course of the campaign.

Give other characters some kind of leverage, something
the entire group needs so everyone becomes involved in the
craft's well-being: ready cash to effect repairs the captain
can't afford on her own; engineering expertise to jury-rig
repairs on the spot; contacts required to fulﬁll the next
part of the journey.

Gamemasters worried about this power struggle before a
campaign begins can give the heroes a ship that requires one
component from each character -- a key card, authorization chit, 
circuit breaker -- to engage the craft's ignition.
Operation stations (pilot's controls, sensors, ﬁre control,
shields) could require a security handprint scan, each one
keyed to a different character.

As a last resort, gamemasters can remind an owner of
her ship's value by seriously damaging the vessel or taking
it away (temporarily, of course). To repair or reclaim it, the
captain needs the help of the entire crew.

Emphasize that every crewmember, whether or not they
own shares in a vessel, contributes to the group's survival.

Assembling the Crew
-------------------

If characters are ﬂying their own ship, they need a crew. These
personnel often include the heroes, sometimes augmented with
a few gamemaster's characters.


### Character Generation ###

If the players know the campaign centers around space travel aboard 
someone's ship, they might generate characters ideally suited for such 
duty. This works especially well if they all have the same interests 
in mind: they're all stationed aboard the same gunship, they work for
the same shipping company, they all owe allegiance to the same
crime boss. Players should discuss and decide who should
serve as captain and co-pilot, engineers, gunners, electronics
experts, and any other specialists required to operate the craft's
systems. Then they can customize their characters according
to their duties.


### Gamemaster Improvisation ###

Sometimes players have their own ideas for characters, don't realize 
how much space travel the campaign involves, or don't coordinate their 
characters during creation. The gamemaster must often improvise to explain 
why they possess a ship, who owns it, what they all do on it, and why
they're sticking with this motley crew anyway. Obviously anyone
with piloting experience has reason to own a vessel, but why
would a mercenary, scientist, or street thief bother signing on?
Gamemasters can make up such motivations: the mercenary
agrees to work as a gunner in return for passage back to his
unit, the scientist offered to upgrade some electronic systems
to study some interstellar anomaly, and the street thief stowed
away while ﬂeeing authorities. Such explanations are best
conveyed during character introductions before the opening
scenario begins. Along the way the obstacles they face cement
their relationships and reinforces their dependence on quick
transport aboard their shared vessel.


### Scenario ###

Build hiring a crew into the campaign -- a good option if acquiring the 
ship takes an entire adventure. This could serve as a means to explain 
how disparate characters came together, or how a crew was carefully 
selected from qualiﬁed applicants. Sometimes everyone's just thrown 
together in the heat of a crisis in which the ship is their only avenue 
of escape. Perhaps the captain assembles a crew not only to ﬂy a ship, 
but to actually steal one in the subsequent adventure.


Passenger Liners
----------------

Most people throughout the galaxy travel by starliner. These
massive capital ships serve as space-borne hotels, transporting
thousands of people between major destinations within and
between sectors. Luxury liners even bring tourists from mainstream 
systems to exotic and remote worlds.

Most liners impose severe restrictions on travel. Passengers
may only board and disembark at predetermined ports according
to a set schedule. Customs and security officials subject everyone
(including the crew) to tariffs and inspections, taxing materials
brought aboard for export and conﬁscating most personal weapons (beyond 
those limited to inﬂicting stun damage). Passengers cannot bring more 
than a limited amount of personal baggage (though this might be 
substantial) -- space in the cargo bay often requires additional and 
exorbitant fees.

Even the most austere liners offer basic comforts: private cabins
(some with up to four berths; others with entire staterooms and
suites), dining room, and passenger lounge. More luxurious amenities 
include domed observation decks, recreation halls, shopping
complexes, live entertainment, opulent restaurants, and casinos.


Starliner Prices, Difficulties, and Modiﬁers
-------------------------------------------

*Credits listed are examples; gamemasters should adjust
them to better reﬂect availability in their own settings.*

*Vessel: Price Difficulty (Credits)*

* No-frills liner: Moderate (400)
* Standard liner: Difficult (4,000)
* Luxury liner: Very Difficult (8,000)

*Condition: Difficulty Modiﬁer (Credits Adjustment)*

* Major destination: -5 (-50%)
* Remote destination: +5 or more(+50% or more)
* Require extra cargo space: +10 or more (+100% or more)


Chartered Ships
---------------

Sometimes characters can afford to charter passage aboard
a craft going in their direction. These vessels aren't dedicated
passenger liners, so they can't offer all the amenities, but they
can accommodate several noncrewmembers in spare personnel quarters, 
berths, or cabins. Sometimes they must jump to
several different systems before reaching their ﬁnal destination,
based on the ship's original itinerary. Less legitimate forms of
transportation may tarnish the reputation of characters who
associate with smugglers, criminals, and free traders.

Characters cannot "charter" an official military vessel; these
ships provide transport only to active duty military personnel
or high-ranking government officials.

Several kinds of spacers tend to accept charters on their
craft. Star merchants are obviously more likely to take on 
passengers than a band of pirates, which would rather strip them
of valuables and send them on their way. Use these samples and
the"Charter Passage" table as guidelines for determining speciﬁc
transport situations in campaigns.

* Smuggler Freighter: Smugglers often pose as semi-legitimate 
freighter or transport captains. They take on passengers
for charter ﬂights for exorbitant sums, often because they need
quick cash for repairs, debts, or unexpected expenses incurred
during their more dubious activities. Conditions often include
no questions asked, and an assumption that everyone prefers to
avoid the authorities. Accommodates are sparse, often consisting 
of the captain's own cabin, or berths usually reserved for
holding spare cargo. Such trips often lead to confrontations
with the law, bounty hunters, and powerful crime syndicate
minions. If spotted with a smuggler captain or a wanted ship,
the passengers may be associated with criminal activities and
gain unwanted attention.

* Free Trader: Many small-time, legitimate traders need extra
money and take on passengers heading in the same direction as
their cargo. Characters going to nearby destinations often pay an
extra fee for the pilot to divert from his primary course. Travelers
share the captain and crew's living quarters, though some small
freighters have one or two basic passenger cabins. Such vessels have
few troubles with the law, though they often fall prey to pirates,
competing merchants, and more aggressive corporate freighters.
The nature of the cargo might also attract trouble.

* Crime Syndicate Transport: Although agents of criminal
organizations prefer more discreet means of travel between
planets, they sometimes require dedicated vessels: mediumsized 
freighters for hauling large, illegal cargoes; light gunships
for defending their interests; and transports for moving bounty
hunters, mercenaries, and other personnel. Passenger accommodation 
varies according to the vessel's proﬁle, though it most
certainly involves exposure to the surly crew and often gruff
personalities working for such an outﬁt. Characters involved
with a crime syndicate (or brave enough to approach one) might
gain passage on such a transport, though payment often includes
fulﬁlling unspeciﬁed "favors" to the organization at some later
time. Although crime bosses operate much more discreetly
than smugglers and other small-time, space-faring criminals,
the characters still run some risk of becoming embroiled with
the syndicate's enemies, such as law enforcement officials and
rival gangs.

* Corporate Freighter: Some captains commanding freighters in 
corporate ﬂeets make some spare credits on the side by
accepting passenger fares, assuming that the characters don't
have reputations as notorious trouble-makers, pay up front,
and are going to one of the vessel's ports of call. Spare crew
quarters provide basic comforts and private cabins. Captains
have little leeway in changing schedules, destinations, or time
in port. Passengers do not have the run of the ship: they must
conﬁne themselves to the wardroom, galley, and personnel decks.
Corporate freighters are among the least risky forms of chartered
vessels, their primary obstacles being customs formalities and
greedy pirates.

* Private Charter Vessel: Dedicated charter services are rare
but exist. Such captains often ﬂy for pleasure and excitement,
having the means to own their ship (or ﬂy one for a wealthy
patron) and not worrying about making lucrative cargo runs to
pay for expenses. Charter vessels vary in size, cargo space, speed,
and armament, offering passengers a variety of ships based on
their needs. Unless they have other planned trips, pilots have
the luxury of ﬂying the most direct routes to nearly any system
on their own schedule. Although perhaps the safest form of
charter ﬂight, it's among the most expensive.

* Characters wanted by law: +10 (+100%)


Warships
--------

Civilian travelers cannot gain passage aboard warships of
official governments, unless, of course, they maintain some
special bureaucratic or diplomatic status, or they're prisoners
in the brig.

Members of the military have the option of transferring
to different posts aboard warships heading to the desired
location. Such travel comes at the military's pleasure: if
no force deploys to the destination planet, one cannot
reach it aboard a warship. Travelers using this option
often ﬁnd themselves under military authority, and they
must observe common martial courtesies, obey authority,
and follow orders if the vessel requires their skills. Should
emergencies require the craft to divert to a hot spot, the
characters have little choice but to tag along (and possibly
become embroiled in the action). For those participating in
purely military campaigns, most action occurs on capital ships
patrolling, deploying to combat zones, or hunting enemies,
though "shore leave" on different planets provides a dirtside
respite from shipboard action.


Restrictive Travel
------------------

Some settings severely restrict interstellar mobility by the
very nature of interstellar travel technology or limitations
imposed by the dominant civilization. Few gamemasters want
to constrain characters and settings with highly controlled
transport systems, but they may wish to create explanations
for campaigns focusing less on star-faring and more on
planetary adventures. Several scenarios exist under which
limited galactic travel might operate.

* Jumpgates and Wormholes: Interstellar technology
could evolve around the concept of limited jump points
between systems, such as massive gate constructs or existing stable 
wormholes. The governments maintaining these
routes exercise a great deal of control determining who may
jump and when. The bottlenecks these points make allow easier
customs inspection, tariff collection, and security scans. They
also minimize unauthorized travel, pirates, and smugglers.
Spacecraft rely on these jump points to open dimensional gates
to other destinations -- they do not possess interstellar drives
to jump on their own (either by lack of proper technology or the
ruling civilization's desire to limit civilian mobility). Characters
can still possess their own ships, but they are at the mercy of
those controlling jumpgates and wormholes for passage to other
worlds. A typical journey requires a bureaucratic application for
the proper travel permits, payment of relevant fees and cargo
taxes, and cooperation with authorities on approach to the jump
point at the scheduled departure time.

* Secret of Astrogation: Powerful institutions may guard
the secret of astro-navigation to destinations, doling it out
only to those with proper authorization and payment. Such
limitations are built into starship technology. The government
may hold the only truly accurate star charts and therefore the
coordinates for the safest routes between worlds; as part of their
official ﬂight authorization, pilots receive a one-use coded data
cylinder that burns out after imparting coordinates to a ship's
ﬂight computer. A enigmatic cabal of sages might control a race
of telepathic aliens with intuitive astro-navigation powers or the
ability to open and close hyperspatial rifts; after obtaining an
alien through official channels, captains seal them in secluded
pod where the creature melds with the craft's navigational system
for the interstellar ﬂight or communes with reality to open a
rift in space-time (though the alien must be returned intact on
arriving at their destination). Such systems that guard the keys
of galactic navigation provide opportunities to steal the secret,
circumvent official channels, and otherwise ﬁnd ways to expand
the heroes' freedom of movement.

* Government Transport: Society and industry ﬂourish
with a legal prohibition on small, personally owned craft and
a dependence on officially sanctioned government starships.
Anyone wishing to travel to a distant world must book passage
on a passenger liner, subjecting themselves to inspections, fares,
tariffs, and the limitations of the ship's schedule and itinerary.
This severely restricts character mobility, and it best serves
campaigns centered on planetary locales.


Space-Faring Authorities
------------------------

Various institutions regulate space travel. The extent of their
power depends on the setting's tone and theme. Travelers on
an exploration mission probably don't run into customs inspectors 
or local system militias -- they have their own problems
investigating the undiscovered reaches of space. Spacers in a
smuggling campaign obviously run into customs officials and
trade organizations, while those in a military setting regularly
deal with war ﬂeets and pirates.

The descriptions herein brieﬂy outline various authorities
heroes might encounter, as well as the extent of their control.
Gamemasters seeking further ideas on integrating such entities
into their campaigns should consult the section on "Politics and
Contraband" starting on page 74 of chapter 5.


Military Fleets
---------------

Most wide-reaching galactic powers enforce their edicts with
vast ﬂeets of military vessels: cruisers and battleships, carriers
with launch bays ﬁlled with ﬁghters, scout craft, and even spy
ships with advanced sensor arrays. The military exists to protect
a government's territory and assets from all threats. Task forces
sortie to confront known enemies, intercepting them before
they strike, destroying their bases, and responding to immediate 
attacks. Small ﬂeets often stand permanent vigil near high
proﬁle targets, ready to repel any assault. Cruisers patrol sector
travel routes to ensure civilian craft have safe passage between
systems. Escorts protect diplomatic vessels engaged in delicate
or dangerous negotiations.
Military ﬂeet facilities and resources include:
* planetside bases for ﬁghter squadrons, ground forces, supply depots, 
and repair units

* orbital docking and repair facilities for capital ships and 
personnel transfer

* deep space deployment and supply stations

* fortiﬁed ground defenses near hostile or frontier territory

* secret deep space listening posts near enemy borders

Some campaigns focus on military activity in space. Characters 
serving aboard warships or in ﬁghter squadrons act as
soldiers of one government against its adversaries: alien invaders,
hostile empires, pirates, and internal rebels. Since they're active
military personnel, such heroes frequently spend their time on
allied ﬂeets guarding against and often directly confronting
enemy warships.

Heroes who aren't in the military may still encounter ﬂeets
in their travels near bases, capitals, combat zones, and planets
of tactical value. Law-abiding characters have nothing to fear
from the massive ﬂeet deployments. Although space navies don't
usually engage in simple law-enforcement activities (especially on
the planetary level), they do serve governments in hunting down
those who have committed capital crimes and severe offenses
(see "Star-Faring Regulations" in this chapter for details about
violations that fall into these categories).


Trade Agencies
--------------

Mercantile organizations control commerce between planets.
Corporate alliances, merchant guilds, and customs administrations 
on the galactic and local level all seek to regulate and
assess fees on interstellar trade. In conjunction with planetary
and sector governments, they help determine which commodities 
merchants can freely trade, which ones require monitoring
through fees and permits, and which materials are contraband.
Trade agencies enforce these agendas with their own paramilitary
ﬂeets and ground units, though these rarely approach the level of
full military forces. Customs cutters patrol systems with heavy
mercantile traffic. Elite sentries protect corporate factories, 
warehouses, and offices. Guilds sponsor punitive measures against
members and outsiders who breach their bylaws.

Trade bureaus most often prosecute criminals who
abuse the space travel infrastructure for personal proﬁt
at the expense of others. They issue permits (and collect fees) 
for purchase, transport, and sale of restricted
goods. They collect taxes based on the value of goods
going to market. They pursue anyone dealing in illegal
or stolen materials, even if corrupt trade agencies handle
such merchandise covertly.

Merchant associations have a variety of available
resources:

* customs patrol ships protect in-system traffic and
board suspect vessels

* agency inspectors examine cargo, check credentials,
and collect taxes on imported or exported goods

* guarded warehouses hold quarantined or impounded
goods

* customs security troops conduct raids against criminal
organizations, smugglers, and gunrunners

* vast office complexes control agency activities, record
transactions, and inﬂuence markets

Civilian characters encounter agents of mercantile
regulatory institutions more often than military forces.
Freighter captains often dread customs inspections,
either docked with a patrol craft or boarded upon landing. 
Fees, tariffs, and penalties related to innumerable
local and interstellar trade regulations eat away at proﬁts.

Even travelers aboard starliners must submit to searches
for contraband. Many guilds require starport businesses to
join their associations to ensure proﬁtability and security.


System Militias
---------------

Local militias maintain peace on the system level.
Such forces vary greatly depending on the planet's wealth,
interstellar status, distance from major trade routes, and
overall importance in regional affairs. Sponsored by the
local government, aristocracy, or dominant mercantile
power, militias vary from one patrol cutter and a handful 
of starport security officers to small in-system ﬂeets
and entire legions of soldiers. These units serve as the
ruling enforcement agency at the planetary level, subject
of course to military forces and trade associations with
interests in the region. Native laws and prohibitions can
sometimes turn a benevolent and helpful militia into a
bullying force aggressively enforcing a local agenda (see
the section on odd local ordinances under "Star-Faring
Regulations").

Although militia resources vary widely, some common 
capabilities include:

* checkpoints to control and inspect incoming and outgoing 
travelers and their baggage

* security stations to respond to law enforcement incidents

* ground and air vehicles to implement local laws and ensure
general safety

* in-system patrol craft to protect against pirates and 
intercept criminals

Heroes visiting any starport inevitably run into local militia.
They patrol the streets, accompany customs inspectors, respond
to criminal incidents, provide protection for valuables, and 
generally enforce an irritating host of petty local laws. Anyone 
getting into trouble ﬁnds a handful of militia guards on their trail.


Starport Control
----------------

The forces that manage and protect starport facilities fall
under the jurisdiction of local militias, though they often operate
independently to ensure their own interests. Smaller operations
simply assign a militia unit to undertake guard duty, tariff 
collection, inspections, traffic control, and law enforcement in port
areas. They are considered starport administrative personnel
simply by the fact that their "beat" consists of docking areas
and warehouses. Immense ports have a huge starport control
bureaucracy that may even rival the size of the local militia
infrastructure.

Starport control resources and facilities include:

* a traffic control tower to monitor starship movements on
approach and departure

* checkpoints to control and inspect freighter cargoes and crews

* ground and air vehicles to secure docking areas and ensure
general safety

* liaison offices to issue permits, identiﬁcation, and other
datawork for interstellar travelers and crews

Anyone frequenting starports -- including independent
captains or travelers -- inevitably encounters starport control
personnel at some level. Pilots talk with traffic coordinators for
approach and departure clearances. Checkpoints and inspections
are routine, but may increase during heightened security. Those
causing trouble within starport precincts usually ﬁnd themselves
facing starport security, with planetary militia forces called in
for serious problems.


Use the "Starport Fees" chart as guide to determining the
difficulties for paying docking charges and repair costs at different 
classes of facilities. Representatives of local militia force
or starport administration collect landing fees in person upon
arrival, require payment at automated kiosks before landing
bay doors open for access to the starport, or deny departure
clearance until paid at a central office. Assume that docking
payments include the cost of basic maintenance for a craft, such
as life-support reﬁlls and fuel/recharging. Modify repair cost
difficulties by +5 (+50%) for heavy damage and +10 (+100%)
for severe damage.


Starport Fees
-------------

*Credits listed are examples; gamemasters should adjust them to
better reﬂect availability in their own settings.*


*Spaceport: Landing Fees Difficulty (Credits)*

* Backwater: Difficult (4,000)
* Dependent colony: Moderate (400)
* Minor: Moderate (400)
* Major: Easy (200)
* Hub: Easy (200)
* Principal government: Moderate (400)


*Spaceport: Repair Labor Costs Difficulty (Credits)*

* Backwater: Very Difficult (8,000)
* Dependent colony: Difficult (4,000)
* Minor: Moderate (400)
* Major: Moderate (400)
* Hub: Easy (200)
* Principal government: Easy (200)


Honor Among Thieves
-------------------
Some more disciplined extra-legal groups provide security
and stability for fringe regions, including pirate bands, criminal
organizations, spacer gangs, and those rising up against established 
and often corrupt galactic authorities. These factions provide some 
semblance of law enforcement where no established government rules.

The resources of impromptu enforcement units differ based
on the nature of the parent organization. Pirate bands implement
a code of conduct to maintain some semblance of order, with
violations prosecuted by an impartial sergeant at arms appointed
by the captain. Local gangs often defer to their leaders to resolve
internal disputes. Organized criminal syndicates retain various
units to ensure peaceful internal operation, root out stooges,
undertake combat operations, hunt down traitors, and carry
out action against those outside the association. Rebel factions
and paramilitary organizations keep strict discipline through a
corps of security personnel.

Although most outlaw groups encourage some degree of lawful
order to operate effectively, some simply bask in savage anarchy
where only the strongest and most inﬂuential survive to make and
enforce the "rules." Lack of any code of behavior only encourages
discord within the ranks, constant in-ﬁghting, disregard for orders,
and an overall weakness when faced with outside threats.


Star-Faring Regulations
-----------------------

Most interstellar and system governments expect spacers to
observe numerous laws and regulations implemented to maintain
peace, prosperity, and safety. Many seem like commonsense
courtesy to law-abiding citizens. Various entities enforce these
ordinances, from starport security and traffic control to local
militias, customs patrols, and in dire cases, military vessels. Those
who obey and respect the authorities, operate within the law, and
fulﬁll their professional obligations have nothing to fear.

Most space-faring personnel must possess some accredited
documentation proving they've received training and certiﬁcation
in their chosen duties. Pilots need licenses, engineers need 
technical certiﬁcates, and gunners need proﬁciency ratings. Vessels 
also require their share of datawork: registration with a government
regulatory agency, permits to carry various types of cargo, and
authorization to mount weapons (even if only intended for selfdefense). 
Assume any character who's legitimately acquired a ship
has the required datawork to allow legal operation. Gamemasters
can revoke such documentation to penalize heroes, particularly
if they commit crimes using their craft.

Although few galactic governments possess universal criminal
codes, most categorize offenses into general classes of illegal
activities. Tolerated misdeeds inhabit one end of the spectrum,
while crimes punishable by execution stand ominously at the
opposite end.


### Tolerated Misdeeds ###

Few governments consider this level of wrongdoing an
actual crime. Offenders really shouldn't engage in such 
activities if they know what's good for them, but they
haven't really harmed anyone else or caused any
disruptive amount of trouble. Those caught
committing tolerated misdeeds often receive
an official warning or an insigniﬁcant ﬁne
(payable on an Easy Funds roll, or 3D+2
times 10 credits). Anyone with a warning
on record unfortunate enough to get caught
engaged in another similar offense (usually in
the same system) receives treatment as if they
had committed a trivial violation.



### Trivial Violations ###

Authorities deem this degree of crime worthy of punishment, but 
more to inform violators of the importance of the law and teach them
a lesson to dissuade violators from repeating their behavior. 
The activities aren't quite worth overlooking, but they aren't 
worth the trouble of imprisoning anyone. Law enforcement officials 
simply ﬁne offenders for their misdemeanors, payable with an Easy to 
Moderate Funds roll (or 1D times 100 credits; adjust depending on the
offense's severity). This slap on the wrist also earns money for
the government's coffers, which some crooked bureaucrats
abuse for their advantage.


### Minor Infractions ###

Criminal activities of this magnitude often violate laws
enforcing control of trade or safe spacecraft operation. Offenders 
cause ﬁnancial harm or put others at risk without inﬂicting
actual physical injury. They disregard revenue-collecting agencies,
ﬂaunt customs regulations, and ignore ﬂight procedures and
requirements meant to insure everyone's safety. Penalties may
include a ﬁne requiring a Difficult Funds roll (or 1D+1 times
500 credits) to pay, or up to 5D days' incarceration.


### Major Infractions ###

Violations at this level constitute obvious crimes in blatant
deﬁance of the government's authority. Those convicted of major
infractions must pay a ﬁne requiring a Difficult Funds roll (or
1D+1 times 500 credits) and serve 4D months' imprisonment.
Enforcement officials also impound any craft involved in the crime
and revoke ﬂight certiﬁcations and starship registration.


### Severe Offenses ###

Authorities consider anyone committing even one offense
of this magnitude a true career criminal. Offenders contribute
directly to the degeneration of society, increased violence, and
underworld activities. Violators receive a ﬁne payable with a Very
Difficult Funds roll (or 1D+4 times 1,000 credits) and spend
5D years in prison. Authorities also conﬁscate any craft involved
and rescind ﬂight certiﬁcations and starship registration.


### Capital Crimes ###
The worst offenses challenge the overarching authority of
governments, the military, their personnel, facilities, and vessels,
other than as an act of war. Those convicted of such heinous
crimes in restrictive societies receive the death penalty, often in the
form of highly publicized public executions to satisfy the mob's
need to see justice served. More tolerant societies sentence such
criminals to lifetime imprisonment or permanent exile where
the prospect of escape and return remain nonexistent.


### Enforcement Modiﬁers ###

Not all infractions carry the same punishments in every system. 
The laxity or strictness of a governing body might increase
or decrease the severity of a crime by one level. For instance, a
fanatically fundamental dictator might impose capital punishments 
for severe offenses, while an open-minded colony council
would tolerate trivial misdeeds. Consider any crime modiﬁed
beyond a capital offense as unimaginably atrocious, prosecuted
with extreme vengeance. Use the "Sample Enforcement Modiﬁers" chart 
as a guide when varying the punishments for crimes
in different parts of the galaxy.

No misdeed is ever considered less than "tolerated" or more
than "capital," regardless of the modiﬁer.


### Odd Local Ordinances ###

Gamemasters might liven up their universe with planets
that severely enforce peculiar laws reﬂecting local custom or
prejudice. Sometimes characters remain unaware of these
strange regulations until they break them, leading to interesting 
encounters with enforcement officials and offended natives.
Such unusual edicts could also provide local color and ideas for
entire scenarios. Planets that depend on interstellar trade and
travel might restrict transient populations of off-worlders to
separate "foreign quarters" where such regulations do not apply,
but expect those wandering outside these contained areas to
abide by regional laws and traditions.

Most cultures consider violation of these local ordinances
minor infractions, but particularly intolerant system governments
might punish offenders according to guidelines for major or severe
crimes. Gamemasters should determine the strictness with which
authorities enforce a strange local law and remain consistent in
its prosecution should characters visit that system later.

The next page has some suggestions for odd local
ordinances.

Alien Prejudice: The local government enforces laws more
strictly against aliens. Tariffs and fees double, infraction levels
increase, and aliens do not enjoy the same freedoms as the
dominant population. Some merchants even refuse to deal with
aliens. Bear in mind that some cultures may view Humans as
undesirable aliens.
Food Prohibition: Authorities consider importing, preparing, and eating certain kinds of foodstuffs illegal. Vegetarian societies proscribe eating meat. Carnivorous cultures ban vegetables
and fruit. Alien species that eat their own kind ﬁnd other food
offensive. Religions or philosophies consider particular foods
"unclean." Importing prohibited food only encourages locals to
violate the law.
Technology Ban: Some planets forbid general kinds of technology or speciﬁc items that the government believes corrupts
the populace or places it in danger. A planet that recently fought
a war against robot armies might prohibit androids, automated
machines, or even computers. Fundamentalist authorities could
outlaw entertainment technology it feels corrupts its followers.
Environmentally conscious governments advocate biases against
pollution-generating engines or machinery intended to strip
natural resources.
Unbelievers Forbidden: Authorities do not tolerate those
who don't subscribe to a particular (and often radical) set of
beliefs. Such laws do not necessarily originate from religious
institutions, but may arise from narrow political views ("Our
planet should dominate the sector."), philosophical morals ("The
way to enlightenment is through generous giving to society."),
and economic theories ("Off-world competition hurts our
ﬁnancial system."). Such feelings reach beyond their limited

ﬁelds and permeate every aspect of society, excluding if not
actively persecuting those who don't believe.
Weapons Ban: To maintain peace, a system prohibits weapons to some degree. Some planets forbid any ship mounting
weapons from landing, while others tolerate armed vessels but
ban crewmembers from carrying any weapons, even those meant
for self-defense. Sometimes a middle-ground exists, with differentiations made between energy and hand-to-hand weapons,
concealed and openly worn, and those for personal defense and
those mounted on starships.

Starship Operations
Drive Systems

Space-faring vessels rely on at least an in-system drive for
short-distance propulsion and for power to operate the ship's
functions. In some settings, they also have an interstellar drive
that enables the craft to "jump" to points across the galaxy.

Power Plant
The power plant provides energy to the drives as well as
onboard components like computers, weapons, life-support
equipment, and shields. In game terms, the plant provides a
set number of energy units used to power other systems (each
with their own energy unit cost). Should a power plant sustain
damage, it may reduce the energy unit output available for
operations (though battery systems and burst capacitors allow
limited function for most systems).

In-System Drives
Most vessels use conventional drives to ﬂy between the various
features of a star system: worlds, moons, orbital facilities, jump
points, spacedocks, and asteroid ﬁelds. The drive not only consists
of the main engines but other hardware (jets, retros, thrusters,
or anti-grav pads) that enables greater maneuverability in both
space and atmospheric ﬂight. Such propulsion systems also allow
smaller craft to enter planetary atmospheres and land on the
surface, though some capital ships may also have strong enough
drives and reentry shields to enable atmospheric ﬂight.
Few vessels use conventional drives to travel between even
neighboring systems. Such ships take vast amounts of time,
sometimes upwards of a century to reach their destination.
Characters sometimes see such drive conﬁgurations aboard
automated freighters ferrying bulk cargo with no arrival deadline.
Lower-technology civilizations often equip colony ships with
such drives as their only method of reaching nearby systems;
settlers survive the journey in suspended animation or are part of
a generation ship (and their descendents arrive at the planet).

Interstellar Drives
The machinery enabling interstellar ﬂight sits near the conventional drives. Each space setting might rely on a different
faster-than-light travel technology, or several might exist within
the same universe.
Interstellar drives propel the ship from one system to another
at speeds beyond that of light. Some open a controlled wormhole

in the space-time fabric, forming a tunnel between the point
of origin and the destination. Others open a rift into a parallel
dimension (sometimes called hyper- or jumpspace) where different laws of physics allow phenomenal speeds. Drives might
cause space to fold, temporarily warping the universe to link the
jump point with a distant location.
The exact technology isn't important in the game or the setting
(it's more for ﬂavor) -- most people take interstellar travel for
granted, though few know precisely how or why it works.
Note that, in most settings, the interstellar drive may not be
activated within a planet's atmosphere. Some settings may go
so far as to dictate where in a solar system an interstellar drive
may be activated without dire consequences.

Drive Ratings
Every interstellar drive has a rating that determines how fast
the vessel travels using that drive. Most civilian ships have ratings
between 0.1 and 0.5, while military drives rate 1 or higher. To
ﬁgure the duration of a jump, determine the base time using
the "Interstellar Flight Times" chart, then divide that number
by the drive rating. For instance, if the base time is 5 days, a
civilian light freighter with a 0.5 drive would take 10 days to
reach the destination, while a battle cruiser with a drive rating
of 2 would take 2.5 days.

Variable Drive Rating
Some settings may prefer to allow their ships to travel at
speeds less than the ship's full driving rating. This does not affect
the difficulty in anyway, though the amount of energy consumed
by the ship is reduced by a proportionate amount. (Thus, if the
ship has a drive rating of 0.5 but only moves at 0.25, the energy
consumption for the interstellar drive is reduced by half.)
Gamemasters also can use this method for deciding the
maximum interstellar movement rate when the drives are crippled
or don't have enough power going to them.

In many campaigns, engaging the interstellar drive propels
characters out of danger and into the relative safety of jump space.
Since such journeys can last from a few days to many months,
the heroes potentially have a lot of time on their hands. Game-

Detrimental Drive Technology _
What if a society's interstellar drive technology has
subtle side effects that slowly emerge during the course of
a campaign? Such defects in accepted scientiﬁc principles
might not immediately matter to the heroes, but they could
eventually become embroiled in a conspiracy to hide the
truth. Devious gamemasters can use one of these sinister
elements to add a dark undercurrent to their campaign.
Solar Fuel: Although a ship's conventional drive
provides the initial energy to engage interstellar ﬂight, a
dimensional tether actually drains the power for sustained
travel from distant and (hopefully) uninhabited stars. A
space-faring society eventually begins collapsing suns and
igniting supernovas. Unless someone harnesses an alternate
energy source for such drives, stars within settled space
may start to explode.
Dark Dimensions: Evil forces reside in the alternate
dimension in which ships travel faster than light. Each time
a vessel jumps, elements of this foul presence seep into the
normal universe. They seek out powerful individuals to
corrupt into instruments by which they can free masses of
their foul kind from their interplanar imprisonment.
Alien Sacriﬁces: Every few jumps, starship crews
must replace large buffer capacitors in the interstellar
drive assembly, a minor expense and simple maintenance
operation. Only the highest government officials know that
these capacitors contain imprisoned aliens enslaved on a
remote, secret world. Each jump drains the creatures' vast
inner power or mental energy to correctly open the portal
into hyperspace or navigate the ship to its destination.
In such situations, governments try to conceal evidence
of these dangers while searching for other, less harmful
means of interstellar ﬂight. Should anyone discover the truth
about the dangers of interstellar ﬂight, they become targets
for authorities willing to go to any length to protect these
technologies. The heroes could uncover such information
and become hunted fugitives, or they might work for the
authorities to"eliminate" inquisitive scientists, environmental activists, and political dissidents intent on exposing the
secret. Characters might even become involved in developing
and testing some new, safer interstellar drive.

masters can simply cut to the next signiﬁcant action, usually
arriving at their destination or being yanked back into normal
space by some anomaly, pirates, or obstruction.
In some cases, however, characters might want some shipboard downtime away from constant action to pursue personal
or scenario-related goals. Gamemasters should decide if any
activities advance the story, develop characters, or gain future
advantages enough for the participating heroes to receive Character Point bonuses.
Character Interaction: The heroes might use this time to
interact with each other, discussing recent developments, planning their next move, or talking with gamemaster's characters
along for the ride.
Research: Using computer databanks, laboratories, or instruments aboard the ship, heroes might conduct research pertinent to
the adventure at hand or their professional interests. Long transit
durations provide plenty of time for such extended actions.
Maintenance and Repairs: Those with engineering talents
might spend time maintaining or repairing the vessel's accessible
systems, especially if damaged in recent confrontations. Most ships
include engineering spaces to reach various components from
within, plus stores of spare parts that tend to wear down. Depending on the length of a journey and the severity of damage, heroes
might have time to make several ﬂight systems repair rolls.
Personal Improvement: Heroes might seek to improve themselves by pursuing knowledge, engaging in hobbies, or trying to
improve their skills. The star-struck stowaway might write love
poetry to his sweetheart back home, the tech wiz might tinker
with spare parts or modify her robot, and the mystic pilgrim
might ﬁnd peace in meditation. Gamemasters also could allow
heroes to advance in game terms by permitting them to spend
Character Points under the pretense that their self-improvement
pursuits have tangible results.

Space Navigation
Ships with interstellar drives must navigate the vast distances
and myriad hazards to their destinations. A complex navigational
computer linked with the craft's interstellar drive enables the
pilot or navigator to set, calculate, and initiate a safe course to
distant star systems. Established routes require simple calculations, but courses to less-visited systems or entirely unexplored
destinations call for intricate computations. Astrographical
hazards like nebulae, black holes, asteroid ﬁelds, supernovas,
and neutron stars can make even short jumps longer or more
difficult to calculate.

Navigation Checklist
Captains or navigators traveling to other systems must
undertake several steps to calculate their course:
1. Verify the trip destination and duration.
2. Calculate coordinates for the interstellar journey.
3. Figure out the navigation difficulty number.
4. Roll navigation and determine results.
1. Verify the trip destination and duration: Using guidelines
from this chapter's "Interstellar Drives" section, determine the

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 1
Notes: Could mean trouble. . .

destination and how long the jump should take. Gamemasters
can refer to the"Interstellar Flight Times" chart or might consult
their own gazetteer, planetary proﬁles, or other campaign notes
for jump durations. Divide this base time by the ship's drive rating
to ﬁgure the actual ﬂight time for this particular craft.
Gamemasters may require an astrography roll to ﬁgure out
the destination, its distance, the best route, and so on. The less
well know the destination is to the navigator, the greater the
difficulty.
2. Calculate coordinates for the interstellar journey: Computers run calculations at amazing speeds, but the information
needed for accurate and safe interstellar ﬂight requires careful
entry and massive processor activity. Captains with regular
schedules often begin calculations for their next destination as
soon as they land, even if for a week-long layover. Others hastily
program their nav-computers while ﬂeeing from authorities or
other adversaries . . . and hope they don't botch the job. Use the
"Calculation Time" chart to determine how long it takes to enter
and process the course coordinates. The more well-traveled a
route, the shorter the time. Cut the time in half if rushing, but
don't forget to add +10 to the ﬁnal navigation difficulty in the
next step.
3. Figure out the navigation difficulty number: Calculating
accurate coordinates requires a base Moderate navigation roll,
adjusted by the conditions outlined on the "Navigation Roll
Modiﬁers" chart. Captains piloting vessels with interstellar
drives and no operational nav-computer have a +30 adjustment to their difficulty, assuming they possess antiquated
instruments that manually plot courses they program into the
drives themselves.
4. Roll navigation and determine results: Upon engaging
the interstellar drives, the navigator or captain makes a navigation
roll to beat the set difficulty. Find the difference between the
difficulty number and this skill roll total (which may be positive
or negative) and reference the "Space Navigation Results" chart
to see how well the journey went.

A radiation surge or other mishap affects
the drive's performance and damages
another system on the ship (gamemaster
selects). The characters must use the
appropriate repair skill with a Moderate
difficulty to ﬁx it. The trip is extended by
2D hours.
The calculations were good enough to
get the characters to a destination, just
the wrong one (perhaps from a computer
malfunction or an unplotted obstacle).
The interstellar drive cut-out to avoid
a collision with an unplotted obstacle.
A Moderate ﬂight systems repair roll is
necessary to get the engines back on line.
The characters must also replot a course
from their new position over the course
of a day.
The computer refuses the calculation and
requires them to be reﬁgured.

Navigation Mishaps
Gamemasters shouldn't limit themselves to the outcomes on
the "Space Navigation Results" chart, especially if more speciﬁc
mishaps would further the story.
For instance, a damaged starship system might prompt the
characters to visit a strange port for repairs, or require them
to do without the equipment for the rest of the scenario. The
obstacle that wanders into their path, forcing the interstellar
drive to cut out, might divert them to a different adventure:
exploring a rogue planet, scavenging a massive derelict alien
vessel, or avoiding a vast enemy ﬂeet.
In cases where the navigation roll fails miserably, gamemasters
can improvise dire results. Rather than the computer simply
disallowing the calculation and aborting any jump before it
begins, it might send the heroes far into uncharted territory, on
a near-miss course with a mysterious nebula, or directly into the
hands of their adversaries. At the very least, it could seriously
damage their ship, stranding the characters far from home in a
very strange part of space.

Intercepting Interstellar Craft
Various agencies often seek to intercept vessels traveling
between systems on interstellar drives. Pirates set traps for
unsuspecting freighters they can disable, board, and pillage.

Military ﬂeets seek to intercept and engage enemy ships heading for fresh targets. Corporations attempt to eliminate rivals
in the depths of space where nobody can ﬁnd the evidence.
Sector authorities try to ambush outlaws. Such people often
employ one of three effective strategies for intercepting vessels
with interstellar drives.
Forced Drive Disengage: Most interstellar drive systems
key into the ship's sensors to detect anomalies in the space just
ahead and then automatically disengage the drive in cases of
imminent collision. This dumps the craft out of any parallel
travel dimension or warp speeds and into normal space in the
immediate vicinity of the obstacle. Usually this results from
faulty navigation coordinates but sometimes from deliberate
interference. Enemies intent on intercepting a target that's
engaged its interstellar drive simply place some obstacle in
the victim's way. This often occurs along major travel routes,
or when those waiting in ambush know the target's intended
course. Depending on their resources, raiders can tow a massive
asteroid (or sometimes an entire ﬁeld, given time), maneuver
a small ﬂeet, or jettison enough large debris into the victim's
path. Governments sometimes employ special craft with huge
gravity ﬁeld generators to simulate an obstacle. The forced drive
disengage often damages the target, though raiders always stand
prepared to close in, disable, and board craft.
Sabotage: When adversaries have advanced knowledge of a
target's identity and course, they sometimes send a saboteur to
inﬁltrate the craft while docked and rig it to disable the drives at
a location advantageous to the ambushers. Since they're under
surveillance before the event, the victims have some chance to
notice someone's monitoring them, but unless they conduct a
detailed inspection of their ship, they won't realize anything's
amiss until the drives cut out. Refer to the sabotage rules in the
"Starship Damage" section for more details.
In-System Intercept: For those without the knowledge or
means to sabotage the target or force the drive to disengage,
the easiest way to catch a ship with interstellar drives remains
intercepting it in a system. Planetary officials rely on this method
when checking vessel identiﬁcation near starports and other destinations. But catching craft unaware often involves intercepting
them just before it engages its drive or just after it disengages it
on entering a system. Unfortunately little cover exists for raiders
to lurk undetected, since most points from which craft engage
their interstellar drive must avoid interference from gravity ﬁelds
generated by massive astrographical features like planets and
moons. Fast-attack vessels rush the target craft ﬁrst to distract
or disable the victim while larger, slower ships move into range
to trap it and prepare for boarding. This situation, however,
provides the most escape possibilities for the victim.

In-System Operations
Most space-faring civilizations have common conventions
regarding ﬂight within star systems, from the trade-route hub
and sector capital to the most remote backwater and unexplored
worlds. Spacers regard these protocols as courtesies to ignore when
it best suits their purpose, though in some more regulated regions
polite procedure forms the basis for enforced travel laws.

Sensors
Upon entering a system or departing from a planet or orbital
station, ships scan nearby space for other ships, unexpected
hazards, or threatening activity. The scanner operator rolls her
sensors skill to notice anything using the craft's instruments,
adding any dice if the ship has upgraded sensors. (Characters
should make a Perception or search roll to make observations
while peering through viewports.)
Operators generally run three different scans depending
on the kind of information they seek about the space around
their ship:
Basic Scan (Easy difficulty): A vessel's sensors always run
a passive scan that collects signals from nearby objects: ship
identiﬁer broadcasts, active comm frequencies, energy from
operational spaceships, stars, planets, moons, and other bodies. Characters use this level to detect the most obvious bodies
around their craft.
Full Scan (Moderate difficulty): An active scan emits waves,
beams, or other energy outward from a craft and picks up signals reﬂected from other objects in space. This provides more
detailed information about targets, but it also alerts others to
the scanning ship's presence (and in many cases the fact that
it's performing a scan).
Dedicated Scan (Difficult difficulty): Operators can focus
an active scan on a particular area or object of interest to gain
even more details about its nature. Tightening the sensor's emissions and concentrating on return pings from a narrow target
has the side effect of washing out readings normally gathered
through basic scans.
Although the kind of scan determines the base difficulty for
successfully noticing objects using the scanner skill, any target's
activity (even if as yet undetected by the sensor crew) also affects
the ability to effectively detect it. Use the "Sensor Target Activity Modiﬁers" chart for guidelines on adjusting difficulties for
speciﬁc sensors rolls.
Use the "Result Points and Success" chart on page 62 of the
rulebook to help determine how many details and the quality
of the information gathered from the scan.

Ship Identiﬁer

02

In many settings, vessels have ship identiﬁers (also known as transponders) that
broadcast basic information about their
conﬁguration and registration to other
craft in the system and starport traffic
control facilities. This alerts others to
the ship's presence for purposes of safe
transit, landing, and departure. Should a
craft crash land, a transponder functions as
a basic rescue beacon even if other emergency signals exist. Authorities also scan
transponders to identify outlaws or vessel's
in violation of local and regional regulations,
while military ﬂeets use them to tell friend
from foe.
Transponder pings send out short bursts
of information: the ship's official name,
registry number (including owner and
captain's names, home port, and any government affiliation), and class (ﬁghter, liner,
freighter, capital ship, etc., and the degree of
armament). This data helps authorities give priority in traffic
patterns, assign routes around the system, and generally guide
ﬂight to avoid accidents.
In most civilized space, law enforcement agencies consider
vessels running without broadcasting a regular transponder
signal as criminal. They view turning off the transponder as a
criminal act by spacers who wish to conceal their identity and
avoid authorities. Unless characters can prove their transponder is
damaged, their ship quickly acquires a notorious reputation.

03

Countermeasures
Some ships can engage various forms of countermeasures
to avoid detection or obscure accurate sensor readings. Turning
off the transponder is the easiest and least effective of countermeasures. Depending on a vessel's equipment, captains might
use other strategies.
Astrographical Interference: Astrographical features that
naturally interfere with sensor readings (nebulae, quasars, black
holes, neutron stars, etc.) can jam scanners and mask a vessel
drifting nearby. The effectiveness directly relates to how close
to the interference the captain can pilot the craft -- often a
dangerous proposition.
Broadcast Jamming: Some engineers rig the ship's communications and sensor arrays to broadcast electronic garbage
(a Very Difficult ﬂight systems repair or sensors task, the skill
depending on whether the rigging uses hardwiring -- requiring
repair -- or software -- requiring sensors). Other vessels' scanner readings get ﬂooded with useless junk. Although sensors
can locate the jamming ship, they have difficulty determining
anything else about it.
Decoys: Some vessels carry decoys that, when deployed,
scatter and transmit sensor data as if they were the target ship.
Exorbitant cost sets these systems beyond the reach of normal
space-faring civilians, leaving governments to equip couriers

and spy ships with such gear. Others might simply jettison
cargo, debris, gas, liquids, or other materials to create obstacles
to scanning and pursuit. Both methods often confuse opposing
sensor operators.
Running Silent: By shutting down all systems, including life
support and the power plant, a ship becomes nearly invisible
to all but the most focused electronic scans. Unfortunately few
vessels can survive for more than ﬁve minutes without powered
life support unless they tap into emergency stores of air. Powering down an entire ship may take several minutes (depending
on its size and complexity), and re-engaging power might take
just as long in an emergency.

Communications
Besides running sensor scans when arriving in a system, most
spacers also contact the local traffic authority to announce their
presence and intended course, and receive any special instructions, general messages to spacers, ﬂight advisories, or notice of
military activity. Officials often initiate contact with incoming or
departing vessels as a standard procedure for monitoring activities in their territory. Only discourteous travelers or those with
something to hide refrain from contact with system authorities
and other ships.
Vessels communicate with each other and traffic control
facilities using subspace transceivers that can broadcast messages
using speciﬁc energy forms and frequencies within a system.
Without sophisticated and expensive encrypting devices at both
sending and receiving ends, these transmissions are made"in the
clear," intelligible to most within the sector tuning into a given
channel. Certain frequencies remain reserved for emergency
communications, traffic control, military activity, advisories, and
official starport and enforcement messages.
Most craft with more than one command station often link
the crew with an internal intercom hardwired into the craft's circuitry. Each station has a speaker-microphone set-up with a"send"

button, though more sophisticated systems exist using headsets
plugged into an interface. Eavesdropping on such internal communications requires either special "bug" devices to boost signals
and retransmit messages or some direct link to the hull.
Only military ships and commercial communications arrays
possess transceivers that can broadcast real-time messages
between systems, and even these require powerful relays and
boost stations.

Pilots and helm commanders ﬂy their ships through space
(and various obstacles they encounter) using their piloting skill.
For speed-related actions, they rely solely on this skill. When
maneuvering, they add their vessel's Maneuverability code to
their piloting skill. Any hazards of atmospheric or astrographic
terrain may modify these rolls -- consult the "Space Movement" chart in this book for space travel, or the "Movement
Difficulty Modiﬁers" chart on page 64 of the D6 Space rulebook
for atmospheric ﬂight.
Vessels travel at various sublight rates associated with their
Move scores, as determined by the pilot. Each rate affects
the difficulty of piloting rolls and the in-system drive's power
consumption.
Full Stop: The ship comes to a complete stop. This requires
no piloting roll unless the ship is slowing from cautious speed
to a full stop in a docking maneuver or a difficult landing. Ships
in atmosphere should be near the ground or they begin a rapid
dive. At this rate, the drive consumes no energy units.
Cautious: The vessel travels at half its Move. This is generally
a free action requiring no roll, but hazardous conditions may
increase it from its base difficulty of zero. Craft in atmosphere
must be attempting to reach a higher or lower altitude at this

Space Units _
"Space units" are an imaginary measure of distance in
space that promotes a more cinematic feel to adventures.
Gamemasters may deﬁne this measure as any value that
they feel is appropriate for their games, though numbers
between a few hundred kilometers and a few hundred
thousand kilometers would be most suitable for emphasizing the size of space.
rate, and they cannot maintain altitude at cautious speed. Drives
consume one-quarter of their energy unit requirement.
Cruising: The ship travels at its Move. This requires an
action, but characters should roll only if movement conditions
would otherwise modify the difficultly from zero. Cruising vessels
consume half of energy units of the drive's standard rate.
High: The craft travels at twice its Move. This requires a piloting roll with a base difficulty of 5, modiﬁed by existing conditions.
Drives consume the standard energy unit requirement.
All-out: The ship travels at 4 times its Move, requiring a
piloting roll with a base difficulty of 10, modiﬁed by existing
conditions. Drives consume 2 times as many energy units.
Ships may travel anywhere between half their current speed
and the full current speed at each level.
Pilots may accelerate or decelerate one level higher or lower
than their current movement rate at the difficulty listed in the
description. For example, a ship at cruising speed may increase
to high speed or decrease to cautious speed; it cannot jump to
all-out speed or full stop without greater difficulty.
To accelerate or decelerate faster, the pilot generates a piloting roll with a difficulty of the ship's scale. If the pilot succeeds,
he can change his speed by one additional level (for two levels
total). If his total is at least twice his ship's scale, he may change
two levels (for a total of three). And if the total is three times
the ship's scale (or more!), he may change three levels, for a
grand total of four; this is enough to bring a ship from full stop
to all out (or vice versa) in one round. Failing this roll means
the pilot was able to make his single free change, but nothing
more. A Critical Failure with a failure means the ship's speed
did not change at all (due to an engine malfunction, computer
error, or some other mishap).

Standard Maneuvers
Maneuvers in relation to static or nonintelligent objects such
as docking facilities and asteroids require a piloting roll augmented
by any dice for the vessel's Maneuverability. The kind of maneuver
determines the difficulty, while various conditions may modify
it. Refer to the "Space Stunts" chart for a summary of spaceship
maneuvers and their associated difficulties and modiﬁers.
Maneuvers relative to enemy craft as targets or attackers
often require opposed piloting rolls (with any Maneuverability
and scale modiﬁers) from the captains. Defenders often employ
their piloting skill as characters would dodge (use the active partial or full defense rules to determine defense totals required to
hit ships evading adversaries). For craft with ﬁxed weapons or

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 1
Notes: Bigger engine means faster exits.

limited ﬁre arcs, pilots might have to make a successful roll to
maneuver into a favorable position from which gunners can ﬁre.
(Firing counts as a separate action from piloting.)
Small craft in space or atmospheric ﬂight can attempt other
maneuvers besides those listed on the"Stunt Difficulties/Modiﬁers" chart in the D6 Space rulebook. The following entries describe
several starﬁghter combat maneuvers and the advantages they
afford if successfully executed. (All modiﬁers are to the speed
difficulty, including any other modiﬁers.)
Break (+10 difficulty): A craft with an enemy on its tail can
attempt to break away, ﬂying out of the adversaries' forward ﬁeld
of ﬁre. If successful, the breaking ship peels off and the pursuer
must make a new roll to reacquire his prey.
Inside Turn (+10 difficulty): Dogﬁghting vessels often chase
each other's tails, attempting to ﬂy in tighter circles to bring the
other into the range of ﬁxed, forward-ﬁring guns. Success brings
the enemy craft into one's ﬁeld of ﬁre.
Overshot (+15 difficulty): Craft under pursuit can try slamming on the retro thrusters, allowing attackers to overshoot them
and come into range of ﬁxed, forward-ﬁring guns. Captains must
make a piloting roll with a +15 difficulty modiﬁer to reduce their
speed by two levels and maneuver out of the way of the pursuing
ship. Failure sends the ship spinning out of control for at least
one round or until the captain regains control (on a Moderate
piloting roll); serious failure (by more than 10 points and with
a Critical Failure) causes both vessels to collide.
Retro Skid (+20 difficulty; space ﬂight only): Fighters with
ﬁxed forward-ﬁring weapons cannot normally shoot at pursuers. By making a piloting roll with a +20 difficulty modiﬁer, the
captain can use thrusters to spin the ship while maintaining
forward momentum, essentially ﬂying backwards and bringing
pursuers into his ﬁeld of ﬁre. Ships hit while performing this
maneuver immediately careen out of control until the captain
regains stable ﬂight (on a Moderate piloting roll). To pull out of
this conﬁguration and engage in normal, forward-ﬂying operation, the captain must make a Very Difficult piloting roll or lose
control of the craft.
Flying in Formation (+5 difficulty): Fighters ﬂying in formation often gain advantages based on their conﬁguration. For
a unit to maintain formation, every maneuver for each captain
increases by +5. Failure breaks up the formation and eliminates
any bonuses from their ﬂight pattern. Several generally accepted
formations confer different advantages:
Vee: Two rear wing ships ﬂank a forward central leader in
an inverted V shape. This arrangement allows the leader to
spot targets, adjust course, and engage foes, while the wing
ships cover him. In this formation, the wing ships gain a +5
sensors bonus to notice enemy craft attempting to pursue or
outﬂank the unit.
Box: Also known as the Finger Four or Wingman Pairs
formation, this arrangement puts two ﬁghters in the forward
position, followed behind and slightly to the side by two wing
ships. While maintaining this formation, the wing ships gain a
+5 gunnery bonus the ﬁrst round they attack any enemy craft
engaging the lead vessel.

File Name: Travel and Combat
Notes: Practice my retro skid stunt.

In-Line: Commonly called Follow the Leader, this formation
puts all craft in a straight line behind a lead ship. When engaging
a single target, it concentrates defensive ﬁre on the lead vessel,
which peels off after attacking so the subsequent, undamaged
ﬁghters take turns ﬁring. All but the lead ship gain a +3 gunnery
bonus when attacking from this formation.

Fleet Maneuvers
Since a ﬂeet operates as a large group of individual vessels,
maneuvers in formation become more complicated. To properly
execute a ﬂeet maneuver (including assembling in formation),
the overall commander must make an Moderate command roll,
modiﬁed by the conditions for the skill's sample difficulties
on page 88 of the D6 Space Rulebook. A single command roll
(again, modiﬁed by circumstances) determines the initiative
for the entire ﬂeet.
Aboard large vessels, each captain under the commander
must make an Easy command roll to effectively order her crew
to perform the maneuver; helm operators must then make successful piloting rolls with difficulties based on speed, modiﬁed
by various conditions (including any maneuver modiﬁer), with
a +5 difficulty modiﬁer for maneuvering in formation. When a
single commanding pilot controls the ship's helm, simply make
the piloting attempt; the command roll isn't necessary. Any

Tracking Starship Movement _
Gamemasters can use minis, counters, or other handy
materials to keep visual track of ship locations during
space battles. Most toy stores have small space- or aviation-themed toys that can represent ﬁghters, freighters,
and capital ships in the game. Some wargames produce
lines of vehicles and ships. The artistically inclined might
draft their own minis: ﬂat counters, folded tent cards, or
complex cardstock models. Even common items found
around the gaming table -- dice, coins, game pieces, pencils
-- can represent vessels and obstacles in combat. Mats or
boards using dry-erase pens offer a surface for noting ship
positions, speeds, and actions.
Gamemasters should allow players to move and position
pieces representing their ships, adjusting them according
to rules and skill rolls so everyone knows where everything
stands. Impose a standard scale; one inch, ﬁve centimeters, or
one square equals one space unit works best. Consider this
the sensors display aboard the heroes' ship, which tracks all
nearby movement. Gamemasters might withhold notations
for hidden or undetected craft, and they might remove the
visual aids altogether if the sensor system goes oﬄine.
failures mean individual vessels go out of formation, negating
any advantages.
Although other ﬂeet formations exist, commanders usually
favor three.
Fleet Box: Like the ﬁghter formation, this arrangement puts
two capital ships in the forward position, while two cover ships
hang back and slightly to the side. In this formation, the rearward
ships gain a +5 gunnery bonus when attacking any adversaries
engaging the lead vessels until they themselves become engaged
by enemy craft. Commanders often arrange their ﬂeets in several
boxes, sometimes creating a broad assault line.
Fleet In-Line: This attack formation mimics the ﬁghter
strategy. A lead craft -- often a particularly heavily armed and
armored capital ship -- leads a line of vessels, shielding those
that follow from ﬁre from the target dead ahead. When within
adequate weapons range, the ships peel off to attack, having
survived the initial onslaught of defensive ﬁre behind the lead
craft. All but the lead ship gain a +3 gunnery bonus the ﬁrst
round they attack the chosen target from this formation. Should
enemy craft break through and engage any craft behind the lead
vessel, the commander must decide (and issue orders) whether
she wishes the ﬂeet to hold formation or break to directly confront the ﬂanking attackers.
Fleet Swarm: Commanders can arrange their vessels in a broad
wall with a bearing perpendicular to the target. This enables all
ships to come into ﬁring range about the same time against concentrated enemy formations or single vessels, focusing ﬁrepower
and swiftly eliminating them. If successfully executed, all ships
in the formation may ﬁre at the chosen target at the same time
and range. At minimum, the target uses one damage resistance
total against each attacking vessel's damage total. The gamemaster

also may include an additional bonus to each skill and/or damage
total for a particularly well coordinated maneuver.
This maneuver works particularly well against ﬂeets ﬂying
the in-line formation.

Movement Failures
A character failing a piloting roll while changing speeds,
attempting maneuvers, or otherwise ﬂying the ship loses control
of the vessel for one round. The vessel might collide with obstacles
or other craft nearby -- see the "Speed Damage Modiﬁer" and
"Collision Damage Modiﬁer" charts for results. If an immovable
force or solid obstacle doesn't stop the vessel that round, the
pilot may attempt to regain control (a base difficulty of 15) on
the subsequent round. The craft remains unmanageable until
the pilot successfully regains control.

Lightening the Load
Obviously, a cargo bay ﬁlled with goods masses more than
one that's empty, but keeping track of a ship's mass-to-drive
ratios gets complicated quickly. Thus, for every full 20% of the
ship that's empty or depressurized, the pilot receives +1 to her
piloting total. (Of course, those who need to breath in depressurized areas must to be in enviro-suits or they suffocate.)
These guidelines, while not entirely realistic, serve well enough
for quick calculations.

Boarding
Personnel on one craft may have need to board other vessels
in the absence of any traditional spacedock facilities. Pirates
swarm aboard disabled prey to pillage valuables. Rescue parties establish escape docks to evacuate personnel on severely
damaged vessels. Customs inspectors board both cooperative
and noncompliant freighters to examine cargo. Corporate and
criminal ships dock in deep space or remote reaches of systems
for clandestine meetings.
Several methods exist for coordinating boarding
maneuvers.
Shuttlecraft: Ships with docking bays and shuttles can ferry
personnel between them. Docking a shuttle within a landing bay
requires an Easy piloting roll (assuming a cautious speed). This
method is the easiest means of boarding another craft.
Mated Airlocks: Personnel can pass between vessels through
a seal formed with exterior airlocks on each ship. One craft must
maneuver alongside the other, match airlocks, and activate the
seal. Ships with boarding tubes can extend these pressurized
corridors to allow personnel access to an exterior hatch, including escape airlocks intended only for egress and maintenance
access panels. This method requires the captain of one ship
to hold his vessel stable while the other matches speed and
makes a Moderate piloting roll. Add the craft's Maneuverability
dice and modify the difficulty for any extraordinarily adverse
or favorable conditions. (For example, boarding tubes greater
than six meters long add 1 to the difficulty for each additional
six meter.) The vessels remain mated at the airlock until they
mutually deactivate the seals. Should either craft sustain damage in combat, pilots must adjust their attitude in relation to

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 1
Notes: Military experience is invaluable.

the other vessel by making a piloting roll greater than or equal
to the amount of damage sustained (regardless of how well the
ship holds up). If this roll fails, the airlocks tear apart; although
the inner hatches maintain pressure, the outer hatches and seals
remain permanently inoperable.
EVA Boarding: When other boarding methods aren't possible, personnel don spacesuits and undertake extravehicular
maneuvers to reach another vessel. Characters can use their
ﬂying/0-G skill to traverse open space between ships, but in
most cases, anchored tether wires link both craft near serviceable airlocks, ensuring safe personnel transit. Personnel shuttle
between them with their enviro-suits secured to the lines to
avoid drifting off. Although tethers limit movement along the
cables, they modify the difficulty of ﬂying/0-G skill attempts
by -5. The vessels remain tethered until someone severs the
wires or deactivates the anchors. If either craft takes damage in
combat, the captain must correct her ship's attitude to maintain
the tether link by making a piloting roll greater than or equal to
the amount of damage sustained. If this roll fails, gamemasters
should randomly determine if the cables go slack (increasing
the difficulty of personnel moving along them by +10), or go
taut and break (possibly spilling personnel into open space, or
trapping them on the other vessel).
Forced Entry: Boarders resort to more severe methods when
hatches remain stuck, damaged, locked, or inaccessible, or when
a disabled ship does not wish to accept hostile boarders. A ship
must ﬁrst successfully maneuver to establish a mated airlock link or
EVA tether. Although boarders can force an entry by cutting hull
plates with plasma torches or trying to circumvent security control
panels at airlocks, most break through using explosives or a fastburning welding paste. Entering through an existing hull breach
also allows access to depressurized sections of the vessel.

Towing
Sometimes one ship needs to tow another, disabled vessel.
Captains usually achieve this in normal
space by applying tractor beams, magnetic
grapples, anchor tethers, or other methods
to secure the craft together. Assuming the
disabled ship does not resist towing efforts,
another vessel may haul it. Towing another
ship halves the Move rate, doubles the energy
units consumed at any particular speed, and
increases the difficulty of any maneuvers by
+10. Gamemasters can adjust this to reﬂect
the relative sizes of each vessel.
Towing craft across interstellar space isn't
so easy. Most assembly facilities customize
and lock interstellar drive ﬁeld conﬁguration to ﬁt the shape of the individual vessel for maximum operational efficiency.
Ships disabled in deep space must either
ﬁt into a rescue vessel's enclosed docking
bay, or wait for a specialized tow craft
that employs special ﬁeld generators to
engulf the disabled ship within its interstellar

File Name: Travel and Combat
Notes: Add more security to hull doors.

drive conﬁguration. Most deep-space salvage craft incorporate
at least one enclosed bay for docking and disassembly, though
larger recovery vessels have special programs that allow them
to reconﬁgure their drive's ﬁelds to haul larger ships using their
interstellar drives.
A doubling of the ﬁeld allows the ship to engulf other ships up
to half the recovery vessel's size into the expanded ﬁeld. It also uses
twice as much power as normal. It can also be a little trickier to
make the navigation calculations, with larger towed ships making
the situation more challenging than smaller ones.

Space Combat

Interaction between space-faring craft is not limited to
peaceful sensor sweeps and communications. Combat inevitably
results when captains disagree with each other's objectives: patrol
commanders hunting down pirates, customs officials chasing
smugglers, ﬁghter squadrons engaging enemy gunships, or
explorers and aliens misinformed by translation difficulties.

Combat Duties
Everyone plays a role in starship combat. Captains maneuver for good positions using their piloting skills and their ship's
Maneuverability dice (if any). Sensor operators scan the area
for targets and threats. Comm jockeys communicate with other
friendly vessels to coordinate strategies and avoid friendly ﬁre.
Engineers repair damaged systems. Gunners engage targets
with their craft's weapons.
Players should determine beforehand what stations everyone's
character normally crews during ﬂight and in combat. Although
this might stereotype some heroes, it helps everyone quickly
dive into combat. For instance, the pilot and co-pilot occupy the
relevant stations in the cockpit, while someone else operates the
sensor and comm boards (usually in the same area). Gunners take
their places at their weapon controls. Technicians stand ready
in the engineering spaces to handle damage as it occurs.

Running Mass Space Battles _
Gamemasters have an overall view of any mass battle,
from small skirmishes to vast ﬂeet actions. Heroes, however, only view their limited perspective. To bring a huge
battle alive, gamemasters must distill larger events to the
characters' level.
Take a large ﬂeet engaging a pirate force. The action
involves several capital ships and a few ﬁghter squadrons
on each side, plus a few retreating pirate freighters. After
the initial long-range salvos, the confrontation degenerates
into a confusion melee, with pirate vessels protecting their
cargo ships, ﬁghters seeking soft targets, and cruisers slowly
closing in through the fray.
Gamemasters should break down this overall strategy
into individual encounters that can affect the overall outcome. Say the heroes are part of a ﬁghter squadron hunting
the pirates. As they ﬂy out to engage the enemy, they must
ﬁrst dodge the opening rain of shots traded by both sides.
They peel off to engage pirate snub ﬁghters intent on striking
the cruisers, diving into several individual dogﬁghts. After
dispatching some ﬁghters, they close with a pirate frigate
intent on ramming the lead cruiser; if they fail to stop the
frigate, it might seriously impede the other cruisers' progress.
Once they eliminate this threat, they can weave through
the pirate lines to disable the cargo vessels.
Gamemasters can break down such large battles from
the perspectives of ﬁghter squads, capital ship crews, and
even boarding parties, making sure everyone has some
obstacle or adversary to overcome before proceeding to the
next challenge and ultimately victory or failure.
Not every hero ﬁnds their place aboard ship. Some don't
have the necessary skills, others can't ﬁnd any open positions.
Nonetheless, gamemasters should involve everyone during
space combat. A spare hand might hastily try calculating new
coordinates to a system to which the ship can retreat if necessary.
Someone could assist the engineer fetching parts or holding tools.
Does someone need to look after or reassure any passengers, or
check up on cargo that might sustain damage? A person at the
computer could identify adversaries, ﬁnd information on worlds
to uses for shelter or repairs, or search for nearby astrographical
hazards that might offer cover.
Even if a character refuses to become involved, gamemasters
shouldn't let them sit out the ﬁght with nothing to do. Perhaps
they're trapped in a damaged part of the ship and must escape.
Maybe the ﬁght disturbs their preferred activity. If even this fails,
gamemasters should still check with heroes to see if they wish to
undertake any actions, even if they aren't related to combat.

Mechanics of Combat
Hitting a target requires a gunnery roll equal to or greater than
a base difficulty number of 10, modiﬁed for various conditions,
including range and any active full or partial defense maneuvers.
Some ships have upgraded targeting computers that give gunners bonuses to their roll. Gamemasters should determine the

difficulty, taking into account all conditions, then players should
make the gunnery roll and determine its success.
Each weapon lists its range in space units, shown as short,
medium, and long (with short deﬁned as one space unit to the
listed number). Most starship-mounted weapons cannot target enemies less than one space unit away. Consult the "Space
Combat Range Modiﬁers" chart to adjust the difficulty number
to hit a target based on its distance.
Targeted captains may use their piloting skill as characters
would dodge. If they forego all actions in a round, they may
make a full defense, adding their piloting roll (plus the ship's
Maneuverability modiﬁer) to the base difficulty of 10. If they
engage in other activities while maneuvering the craft out of
harm's way (such as attempting a stunt), they can make a partial
defense; their piloting plus Maneuverability roll becomes the
new difficulty for attackers to hit them. These conditions are
cumulative with any range modiﬁers.
Starships may also take cover behind nearby objects
-- asteroids, capital ships, space stations, debris, or the like
-- assuming their captains can make piloting rolls to reach
them. Use the cover modiﬁers from page 73 of the D6 Space
rulebook as guidelines.

Damaging Parts of a Ship
Instead of making a general shot at a target, some ships ﬁnd
it more effective to go after a small portion of a larger ship. This
adds a called shot modiﬁer of +1D (+3) to the difficulty, but the
attacker may now use the scale of the small target instead of that
of the whole vessel. Unless otherwise speciﬁed in a description
of the part (or at the gamemaster's discretion), the target has a
Toughness equal to its vessel's Toughness (including armor and
shields). Generally, a damage total of 13 or more destroys the
part, though it has no effect on the larger ship (except that it can
no longer use that part). Of course, if the target happens to be a
weak spot, the larger vessel could be in serious trouble . . .

Targeting Projectiles
Mines, missiles, torpedoes, and probes have a scale value of 5
for purposes of targeting or defending against them. They resist
damage with a Toughness of 3D. Beating the Toughness by one
to nine points makes them to go off prematurely, causing their
damage (not including scale modiﬁers) to anything within one
space unit of them. Exceeding the damage resistance total by
13 or more obliterates them.
For purposes of determining damage, a projectile's scale value
is not altered by its launching ship's size.

Note: Most weapons can't lock on targets closer than one

Scale and Space Ships _
A larger ship attacking a smaller ship has a modiﬁer to its
combat difficulty and to its damage. Note that the damage
modiﬁer does not mean that the bigger ship actually did
more damage; rather, because the defending ship is small, it
has less area over which to spread the effects of the attack,
thus making it seem like more damage was done.

Shields
Although every vessel uses low level energy shielding to resist
micro-meteors, debris, space dust, and the heat of atmospheric
re-entry, most rely on weapons-grade shields to repel enemy
ﬁre and other serious damage.
Raising shields requires three steps:
1. Determine which sections of the ship to protect.
2. Divide shields dice among areas.
3. Determine the difficulty and roll shields skill.
1. Determine which sections of the ship to protect: Operators must decide over which quarters of the vessel to deploy
shields. They may choose any combination of forward, aft, starboard, and port. For instance, a ﬂeeing craft might raise shields
aft to deﬂect ﬁre from pursuing adversaries. A ship charging into
battle might activate shields fore, starboard, and port.
2. Divide shields dice among areas: Ships have shield die
codes representing their strength. Divide these dice and pips
(remembering that each die has three pips in it) among the
protected areas. If shields cover only one area, use the full die
code when absorbing hits. If a ship with +2D shields raises them
over three areas, the operator might divide the strength evenly
as +2 or unevenly as +1D+1 forward, +1 starboard, and +1
port. Areas not covered by shields take hits directly to the hull
and do not add any shields dice to resist damage.
3. Determine the difficulty and roll shields skill: The difficulty to successfully deploy shields depends on the number of
areas covered, as shown in the "Shield Deployment" chart. The
more areas to protect, the more the operator must scramble to
angle the deﬂectors, divert energy to the proper generators, and
successfully activate the system. Success brings the shields online
with die code strengths determined earlier. Failure represents
the inability to raise shields adequately, allocate power resources,
or channel the deﬂectors over the proper quarters. Operators
may try again next round.
When a quarter protected by shields sustains a hit, add the
shield die code allocated to that area when rolling the ship's
damage resistance total (which also includes its hull Toughness,
armor, and, possibly, scale modiﬁer).
Shields remain deployed until powered down, overloaded,
or damaged. Deﬂector generators overload when any section
protected by shields permits more than three times the current
setting die code of damage to get through (not including pips).
The shields shut down, and the operator must spend another
round reactivating them. Damage that penetrates the hull may
also disable the shields temporarily or permanently. The greater
the damage, the more likely this is to happen.

Tractor Beams
Vessels equipped with tractor beams may use them to capture
other ships. These energy ﬁelds inhibit movement and often
draw one craft closer to the other.
Locking a tractor beam onto a target requires a successful
gunnery roll. Compare the beam's "damage" against the target's
hull Toughness (taking into account scale modiﬁers if using
optional combat rules on page 83 of the D6 Space rulebook).
If the total is equal to or higher than the defender's total, the
tractor beam gains a hold. If lower, the target manages to break
free or evade the beam at the last minute.
Operators can slowly reel in passive targets for boarding
actions effected through landing bays or docking gantries.
Few targets prove so cooperatives. Ships can break free if
they roll their hull Toughness higher than the tractor beam's
damage. If the beam's damage is greater than or equal to the
hull Toughness roll, the target ship slows, drawing closer to its
captor. Consult the "Tractor Beam" chart to see how the results
limit the target's maximum movement rate.
Example: A vessel resisting a tractor beam at all-out speed
fails its hull Toughness roll against the beam's damage by 12
points. Next round it can only resist at cruising speed (two levels
less than all-out speed).

Resisting a tractor beam's pull sometimes damages the captured
craft's drive. Ships that fail their roll against the beam's damage by
16 or more points lose all thrust and sustain severe damage (see the
"Starship Damage" section for details on effects and repairs).

Tracking Energy Units

27

A ship's power plant output powers all onboard systems. This
usually suffices for standard operations, even in combat. But when
varying speeds especially, demand might overwhelm the energy
unit supply, leaving some essential systems without power.
In cases where enough energy units aren't available, currently
powered systems take precedence over systems just coming
online. If increasing speed, raising shields, or discharging a
weapon take too much power, the action simply fails. A vessel's

computer automatically diverts power from damaged systems
so energy units don't bleed off into useless machinery.
Players may wish to keep simple notes to track how much
power their craft uses in various situations. They should jot down
how many energy units their vessel uses under normal operation, cautious operation (power for shields and all weapons),
and at various speeds. All-out speed consumes 4 times as many
energy units as at cruising speed. Under some circumstances,
captains might have to decide between powering the drives,
raising shields, and discharging weapons.

15

Boosting Power Output

10
11
12
13

The level starts at Very Light and increases by one level for each
additional area that was boosted beyond the max.
Example: A ship has 1D in shields. The operator wants to
increase one area by +2; this draws an additional four energy
units from the power plant. If she wants to give this bonus to
three areas, the per-area bonus is still +2 but the energy draw
jumps to 12.
Some gamemasters may also allow characters to boost the
damage of their energy weapons. or the skill bonus provided by a
system. This requires 3 times the normal energy for a +1D increase
(see the relevant chart in the"Revised Ship Design" chapter). It also
does one level of damage to the equipment for each 2D increase
in effect, unless (time-consuming) precautions are taken.

29

Red-lining a ship's power plant to generate more energy is
never a good idea, but some pilots need the extra boost to survive
desperate situations. A technician working in the engineering
spaces must undertake this complicated procedure; captains of
single-pilot craft or ships without ready access to power sources
cannot try boosting the power output.
Technicians must make a ﬂight systems repair roll to tap into
emergency battery relays, reconﬁgure power ﬂow parameters,
ignite burst capacitors, and overload the power plant, increasing the number of energy units available for three rounds. The
difficulty starts at 5 for a 10% increase and goes up by +5 for
each additional 10%, up to a maximum of 50%. Round the
energy unit increase down.
After three rounds, the power plant overloads and sustains
Heavy damage; power plant output drops to half until repaired,
and the craft loses 1D from Maneuverability or, if at 0D in
Maneuverability, top Move speed is decreased by one level. The
gamemaster may allow exceptional rolls to further increase the
power, allow the power plant to sustain that output for longer
than three rounds, or lower the effects of the damage.
Shutting down the power plant before the beginning of the
third round reduces the plant damage to Light. Furthermore, the
power plant may not be boosted until after it's been repaired.
Should the technician fail her roll, the plant generates no
additional energy units, and it sustains severe damage: output
drops to half until repaired, and the ship goes out of control,
decelerating by two levels each round until it comes to a stop
or crashes into something.

30

Using the Extra Power

31

The extra energy units generally are spent in one of two ways:
to increase speed or to improve shields.
Increasing speed is fairly obvious: To go faster at
sublight speeds, the in-system drive requires more

Starship Damage
Gunnery rolls equal to or greater than the difficulty to hit a
target inﬂict damage. The attacker rolls the weapon's damage
die code, while the defender rolls his vessel's hull Toughness,
plus any bonuses from armor raised shields in the hit quarter.
If using optional combat rules, factor in modiﬁers for scale.
If the damage total does not exceed the hull Toughness roll,
the weapon only buffeted the ship, singed the hull, or failed to
penetrated deployed shields.
If damage exceeds hull Toughness, compare the difference
between the two and consult the "Ship and Passenger Damage"
chart. The higher the damage total, the more harm the craft
sustains. Crew and passengers also may take damage as shown
on the chart.

Levels of Damage
Very Light damage causes the ship to lose 1D from Maneuverability for the current round and the next. Redundant systems
automatically reroute power, while others reactivate after going
down for a moment.
Light damage reduces the vessel's Maneuverability by 1D
or decreases the top Move speed by one level. This damage
remains until repaired. Minor systems blow out, straining the
power plant.
Heavy damage lowers the craft's Maneuverability by 2D
or drops the top Move speed by two levels. If using advanced
damage allocation, various essential systems sustain damage
and go oﬄine until repaired.

Ship and Passenger Damage _

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 1
Notes: Keep spare parts on hand.

Severe damage completely disables the drives, sending the
ship is out of control, decelerating it by two levels each round
until it comes to a stop or collides with something. With the
optional damage allocation, this damage destroys various
onboard systems.
Destroyed craft never operate again -- everyone onboard
perishes unless they somehow managed to get in and jettison
escape pods at the last moment.

Optional Damage Allocation
Gamemasters may decide to vary the results for vessels sustaining Heavy and Severe damage instead of or in addition to
reducing a ship's Maneuverability dice or top Move speed.
Heavy or Severe hits may take entire onboard systems oﬄine.
Roll on the"Damaged Systems" table to see which components go
oﬄine. Ignore or reroll results for already inoperative systems.
Systems hit by Heavy damage remain inoperative for 1D
rounds, or until someone makes a Moderate ﬂight systems repair
roll. In the case of communications, sensors, and the navigation
computer, a Moderate roll in the appropriate operations skill
reboots the system and brings it back online.
Systems sustaining Severe damage remain oﬄine until
repaired or replaced.
Gamemasters may also wish for starship damage to affect the
heroes and their movement within their craft. Each time the vessel
sustains Heavy or Severe damage, roll on the "Onboard Damage
Events" chart. Although these conditions don't immediately affect
the ship's ﬂight and tactical operations, they provide additional
challenges for the crew, as well as events to involve those not
immediately participating in combat activities.
Gravity Oﬄine: The vessel's artiﬁcial gravity generators go
down, leaving the entire ship in a state of zero-gravity. Although
crew strapped into their seats have no problem discharging
their duties, anyone moving about the craft (using handholds,
hatch entries, and other static features) must do so on an Easy
ﬂying/0-G roll.
Debris Blockage: A hit dislodges debris from a storage
locker, cargo web, or blown corridor panel. Heroes seeking to
pass the blockage and move to another section of the ship must
ﬁrst clear it with a Moderate lift roll or, if gravity went oﬄine,
a Difficult ﬂying/0-G roll.
Onboard Fire: A power surge sparks a ﬁre that bursts from
a control panel near one of the crew. Gamemasters should
choose the ﬁre's location, or roll on the "Damaged Systems"
chart to randomly determine the operator's station from which it

By law, most ships carry ﬂame extinguishers or ﬁre-suppression

or limited resupply funds. If heroes don't act to extinguish the

Lights Burn Out: An energy spike from damage or the drives
blows out all the lights, plunging the ship into darkness. Only
the indicator diodes, button illuminators, and display screens

head and no functioning waste removal system. Otherwise, the
blown head simply stinks up the ship and complicates personal
hygiene until repaired.

begins to suffocate at a rate of one Body Point per round or one
Wound level every six rounds. (Armor cannot protect against
this; the gamemaster may limit what other Special Abilities
can resist this injury.)

Sabotage
Adversaries sometimes seek to disable or destroy vessels by
sabotage. Corporations plot to delay their competition. Pirates
hope to disable freighters with valuable cargoes in favorable
ambush zones. Military forces incapacitate enemy shipping
while avoiding direct confrontation in battle.
Sabotage involves inﬁltrating a ship and rigging its components to malfunction or explode. Two approaches accomplish
this effect: setting explosives or jury-rigging the craft's existing
systems (such as the drives, power plant, or weapons).
Explosives: Using the demolitions skill, characters can set
explosives to detonate at a given time, under predetermined
conditions, or when a particular ship's system activates, depending on the type of trigger device used. This requires a Moderate
demolitions roll, with a +5 modiﬁer to the difficulty for each
+1D of additional damage desired. Other modiﬁers from
"Example Skill Difficulties" for demolitions on page 89 of the
D6 Space rulebook may also apply. In most cases, an explosive
deals damage to a speciﬁc ship's system near the blast. Assume
that most components possess from 3D to 4D Toughness for
purposes of determining damage effects. Gamemasters might
wish to use the optional scale modiﬁers on page 83 of the D6
Space rulebook if the explosion affects the entire craft.
Planting charges near a particular system requires the
saboteur to successfully inﬁltrate the ship. Setting explosives
on exterior components seems easier, but has less-predictable
results; in these cases, treat blast damage as if it were dealt against
the vessel's hull Toughness and not a speciﬁc system.

+1D extra damage, assuming an exploding component causes
2D to 3D base damage.
Detecting Sabotage: Crewmembers performing checks for
tampering must successfully search the correct area sabotaged.
They must make an opposed roll using Perception (with a +5
difficulty modiﬁer), ﬂight systems repair, or search against the
saboteur's demolitions or ﬂight systems repair total. Attempts to
further conceal sabotage may increase the difficulty to spot it.
Alert heroes might also spot saboteurs in the act, especially if they
must enter the craft to effect their destructive modiﬁcations.

Self-Destruct
Under certain circumstances characters may wish to set their
ship to self destruct.
Most military and espionage craft possess integrated scuttling
protocols, often controlled directly from the bridge or cockpit and
needing little more than a key or code to initiate. Deactivating
such self-destruct measures without the proper authorization
requires a Very Difficult computer interface/repair roll if making
the attempt at the primary controls, or a Very Difficult ﬂight
systems repair roll if trying to disengage scuttling hardware at
the main drives. Don't forget to add any modiﬁers for rushed
actions or other stressful conditions.
Vessels without integrated self-destruct mechanisms require
a bit more work to scuttle. Captains often ﬁnd some way to set
the drives to overload; in most cases, the trick is to set them to
explode after everyone escapes the ship. The technical aspects
of blowing the power plants (or some other explosive part of the
craft) requires a Very Difficult ﬂight systems repair roll. Timing
the destruction sequence according to one's own preferences
requires a Difficult computer interface/repair roll. Failing either
can result in premature detonation, no overload at all, or some
disabling but not fully lethal effect.

Jury-Rigged Sabotage: More subtle methods of sabotage
require more artistry than simply blowing up parts of a ship.
Skilled technicians can rig starship systems to malfunction
-- sometimes violently -- using materials available onboard:
spare parts, tools, and existing components. This requires a base
Moderate ﬂight systems repair roll, even though the actual work
resembles more destructive modiﬁcations than repairs. Gamemasters can adjust this roll based on the saboteur's familiarity
with the craft, available parts, desired effect (from simple system
deactivation to full-out explosion), and the degree to which such
tampering remains hidden from the crew. This approach almost
always requires internal access to the target vessel, putting the
saboteur in danger of discovery. The ultimate results depend on
the saboteur's purpose. In some cases, speciﬁc systems simply
malfunction at particularly inopportune moments for the crew:
the shields go down in the midst of a battle, the interstellar drive
malfunctions before a jump, weapons lock up. Saboteurs may
also try to permanently disable or destroy these systems without
compromising the rest of the ship. Other times jury-rigged
modiﬁcations cause massive explosions within the hull, usually
the result of causing power feeds, emergency batteries, and burst
capacitors to overload near other sensitive components. In this
case, increase the ﬂight systems repair difficulty by +5 for every

What's in this Chapter

This chapter reﬁnes and elaborates the basic system presented
in chapter 16 of the D6 Space core rulebook. Some parts have
been modiﬁed for clarity and to allow greater ﬂexibility in ship
design.
The ship design system involves a lot of imaginary science,
particularly with such components as equipment that can offset
inertia and propel the ship between the stars. Most characteristics
are purposely vague, to allow gamemasters to include their own
technobabble for how it all works. Gamemasters are encouraged
to tailor this system to their own setting by altering costs, restricting the available components, and adding their own modiﬁers
for alternate gravities, ﬂuctuating power levels, and so on.
Keep in mind that in most science ﬁction universes, there are
thousands of variations on the equipment listings herein, and
an equal number of totally unique pieces of equipment. Aliens,
strange scientists, and accidental engineers employ technology
that just doesn't ﬁt into the standard descriptions.
The gamemaster and the players can collaborate to produce
new, more or less effective, and unique equipment. To do so,
start with what you have here and modify. To keep the situation
balanced, you might also want to build in "prototype ﬂaws" or
"alien technology issues" -- maybe on a Critical Failure, the
weapon changes targets randomly or the ammo loader refuses
to drop the next missile into the rack.
Furthermore, not all pieces of equipment should be identical.
Gamemasters can prevent their players from getting complacent
-- "Oh, it's only got a light laser -- damage of 6D. We can take
that in our sleep." They should always be guessing -- did the
pirates boost the damage? Is it really a laser? What are those
funny "bumps" on the side of the ship -- did someone ﬁgure out
a new way to channel more energy through the weapon?
This also gives players incentive to follow up rumors and
leads on buying new or improved equipment, and try to improve
their own. The gamemaster may impose "caps" on what they can
get or do -- for now. A good ship owner will probably spend
thousands of credits just following up a dozen different leads on
new gadgets and gizmos, hoping even one pans out big.

Imposing Limitations

As with most of the D6 System, the space ship design rules
leave a lot of room for creating almost anything in any setting.
This works ﬁne in some settings, but for others, gamemasters
should come up with limitations to make the vessels best ﬁt

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 2
Notes: Get a better ship.

their universes. A few suggestions include imposing a maximum
movement rate and/or Maneuverability; limiting the size or shape
of vessel that can have atmosphere capabilities; and imposing
increasing costs on adding large amounts of shielding or sizable
power plants to big ships.

Using the Ship
Design System

With this system of modules with deﬁned parameters, nearly
any type of space-faring vessel can be created. There is an almost
inﬁnite variety of module combinations possible, and your
designs can be as complex as you are comfortable with.
You can ﬁnd two worksheets -- for the four- and threefactor systems and one for the freeform system -- in the back
of the book.

Crew _

34

A single person can run any size ship -- she just won't
do a good job about it. Each additional task she must perform in a round counts as an action, with serious penalties
mounting. That's why military vessels often have three or
four crewmembers each for commanding, piloting, sensors,
communication, engineering, system repairs, and each of
the weapons. (Having multiple persons for each position
allows crewmembers to get adequate rest.) They'll also
have additional people to cook and clean for the other
crewmembers.
Similarly, large research or exploration vessels include
scientists, instructors, lab technicians, and others.

Design Method
Four-Factor Design
If you want to go through the system and use all of the variables, lay out your vessel design on graph paper, designating each
square as a meter on a side. Arrange the modules as you wish,
making sure that each module takes up the required number of
units, and that each connects directly to another module. You'll
need to keep track of four factors: area, mass, energy units., and
cost (These terms are explained later in this chapter.)
This system works best for small to medium ships.

Three-Factor Design
For large ships, you might ﬁnd it easier to only keep track
of three factors: mass, energy units, and cost. (You could also
ignore cost, multiplying the total mass by 700 credits to get the
total price, but you'll end up paying more. It's the nature of not
shopping around for the best deal.)
Select the modules you want, adding four to six hallway
modules for every room on the ship (regardless of the actual size
of the room). This amount serves as a good average of wide
corridors, narrow accessways, and lifts between levels.

32

Example: Two bridge modules bought to make a larger bridge
counts as one room. A bridge and a duty station bought and
intended for different parts of the ship count as two rooms.

33

Divide the total mass by 2 and round up to get the number
of area units in the ship.

You can also opt for a more freeform approach, in as detailed
a fashion as you want. You could go so far as to select modules
and assign whatever size you want to them. At the least, you
should ﬁgure out values for crew, passengers, cargo capacity,
life-support supplies, in-system and interstellar drives, Maneuverability, hull Toughness, armor, shields, weapons, length, and
scale. A "Freeform Ship Design" log has been provided for you
at the end of this book.
If, upon later examination, the modules selected don't add to
a ship of the desired size, consider that the extra space is taken
up with spare parts, cargo holds, leisure rooms, and passenger
accommodations -- perhaps even hidden compartments.
Most ships designed using the freeform system may have a
Move no greater than 8 and a Maneuverability no greater than
3D. Gamemasters may allow different maximums, depending

on the setting or the number of weaknesses or problems the
vessel has.
Naturally, the gamemaster has ﬁnal approval over the design
of the vessel, whether it's made using the guidelines presented
in this book or not.

Ship Roles

The design process always begins with a determination of
the ship's purpose. Given the astronomical expense of designing and constructing of a star-faring vessel, most ships are very
speciﬁc in their roles. It's simply too costly to build a vessel that
can fulﬁll many roles, so shipwrights concentrate on a particular
job for the vessel, whether that be in-system defense (requiring a
focus on weapons and defensive systems, but with no need for an
interstellar drive), or long-haul cargo transportation (requiring
ample storage space and a large, dependable interstellar drive).
Once a ship's purpose has been decided upon, you can take
notes on general ideas for the details: the crew complement, the
passenger space, and the types of drives, armor, and weapons.
Use those notes, along with a copy of the Ship Design Log, and
go through each section of these rules, entering the details on
the log. The worksheets included with the Ship Design Log can
help you ﬁgure out the space, mass, energy requirement, and
cost totals for each aspect of the vessel.
Note that it's a rare case that modules are added after ship
construction. Designers often add additional bulk cargo space
to allow future captains room for expansion.
The following entries describe the common roles that many
vessels fall under, as well as the design considerations that should
be kept in mind for those roles.
In-System: The vessel is for use within a particular solar
system, and as such, no interstellar drive is necessary. This is not
a role, but rather a qualiﬁer of another role. In common parlance,
spacefarers often refer to in-system craft as "spaceships." Design
considerations include no need for an interstellar drive.
Interstellar: The vessel is intended to travel between solar
systems. This is another qualiﬁer of a role, rather than a role
itself. In common parlance, spacefarers often designate interstellar craft as "starships." Design considerations include an
interstellar drive.
Fighter: Fighters are most commonly small in-system vessels
used for combat, which launch from planetside, orbiting defense
stations, or starfaring carriers. Some larger ﬁghters can be ﬁtted
with interstellar drives themselves, but the space and cost is better
spent on weapons and defensive systems. The role of a ﬁghter
is to act against other similar craft or (in groups) against larger
vessels. Design considerations include one or two crewmembers,
large in-system drives (for speed), and as much armament and
defensive capability as the vessel can carry.
The bomber version of the ﬁghter carries projectiles (such
as torpedoes and missiles) as its primary weapon, rather than
energy weapons. The role of the ﬁghter-bomber is to target
larger vessels or stations, or stationary ground-based targets.
Design considerations include two crewmembers (a pilot and
a bombardier), an in-system drive, and projectile weapons.

Shuttle: This is small vessel (usually under 100 tons) used
primarily to ferry passengers back and forth between
destinations. Shuttles are most commonly in-system
vessels and used for ship-to-shore or ship-to-ship
transportation. Design considerations include one or
two crewmembers, large-capacity passenger seating
(or accommodations on longer voyages), and insystem drives.

15

18

Gunboat: Also known as a drop ship, this combat
vessel is an armed shuttlecraft whose primary role is to
ferry combat troops to their destination, and to provide
weapons support once there. Some governments use
gunboats as in-system interdiction craft, intercepting
smugglers and engaging in anti-piracy operations. Design
considerations for a gunboat include accommodations for
passengers (in this case, the troops or boarding party that
the vessel carries), an in-system drive, and a good balance
between weapons and defensive systems.
Scout/Survey Craft: This vessel is used primarily to
engage in exploration or survey. Those without interstellar
drives are often dropped off by a larger ship and picked
up months later. They require accommodations for the
crew, storage for items or (in the case of rescue craft)
ships, and a drive suitable for atmosphere use. Design
considerations include accommodations for the crew,
lab space for scientists, storage for samples and items
they pick up along the way, and a large, dependable
interstellar drive. Armaments are few, but many
scouts have considerable defensive systems, as you
never know what you're going to run into in the cold
depths of unexplored space.
Yacht: This luxury vessel is owned by only the wealthiest
citizens or corporations. The key word here is luxury. Design
considerations include comfort as the primary goal -- staterooms
that are many times larger than required, massive lounge areas,
gardens, exercise facilities, and so on. They may be ﬁtted for
in-system or interstellar travel.
Patrol Ship: This is a military or police vessel whose primary
purpose is the control of a particular zone of space. These vessels
are used for border defense (preventing anyone from crossing
their patrol zone), anti-piracy (protecting merchant freighters
against attack), or customs (intercepting and inspecting any
vessel crossing the zone). Design considerations include heavy
armament and defensive capability (as you would expect with
any military vessel), as well as long-term accommodations for
the crew, who often stay on patrol for extended periods. Add
large in-system drives to generate speed and maneuverability
and turn this into an interceptor.
Freighter: The workhorse of any interstellar society, a
freighter is a vessel designed to carry cargo from one location
to another, forming the backbone of trade and communications throughout the galaxy. The primary design consideration,
naturally, is cargo space, with other considerations varying,
depending upon the whims of the owner. Some freighters
possess passenger accommodations, so that they may charge
to bring passengers along with them on their runs. Armament

and defense are always present, but they vary from ship to ship,
depending upon the relative safety of their cargo routes. Ships
that commonly travel through pirate space are more heavily
armed than in-system freighters that operate within comfortable
reach of the local naval base.
Liner: This vessel's role is similar to that of a yacht but on
a larger (and often more luxurious) scale. The liner ferries passengers through interstellar space, from system to system (though
some merely tool around one system). Design considerations
include huge amounts of passenger accommodations (there are
often various classes of accommodations: "steerage," where passengers share communal bunks; "basic," where passengers share
two-person rooms; and "ﬁrst class," where the accommodations
are as luxurious as on any yacht). These vessels are usually lightly
armed (if at all), but they occasionally travel with escorts.
Carrier: This is vessel designed to transport smaller sublight
ships from system to system. They are primarily military vessels,
carrying squadrons of ﬁghters through interstellar space. The
main design considerations for a carrier are hangar and launch
bay facilities for the ships that it carries, plus accommodations
for the pilots and crew and an interstellar drive.
Warship: The primary purpose of this large military ship
is the destruction of other vessels. Warships vary in size and
role, and often similar vessels from different nations will have
different names that reﬂect the different philosophies at work.

For example, a large warship of a nation that uses its navy to
protect its citizenry might be called a ﬁrst rate ship of the line,
whereas a similarly outﬁtted vessel from a more aggressive, warlike nation might be called a war striker. Brieﬂy, though, here
is a run-down of the general roles of military vessels, based on
classical Earth navy equivalents:

Of course, depending upon the campaign, it's also entirely
possible that warships may follow entirely fantastical naming
conventions, ﬁlling star systems with "battlestars" and "birds of
prey." In any case, the design considerations for a warship obviously would focus on maximum military effectiveness: weapons
and defensive systems.

> Frigate: the smallest of the capital ships, primarily used
for patrol or escort duties
> Destroyer: mid-sized vessels, primarily used for ship-toship combat
> Cruiser: large vessels, primarily used as the command vessel
for multi-ship task forces
> Battleship: the largest vessels, with massive armaments,
used to command entire ﬂeets

Terms

Within each of these general classes of warship, there is wide
variety as well. A cruiser, for example, that is smaller than the
average cruiser but still fulﬁlls the same role might be called
a light cruiser. A destroyer whose primary weapons platform
are torpedoes and other projectile weapons might be called a
"missile destroyer."
There is even some variance in the roles. A cruiser that has
been designed to act as a satellite vessel to a battleship, rather
than commanding its own task force, might be referred to as an
"escort cruiser," because it's still a large, cruiser-class vessel, even
though its duty is not the usual cruiser assignment.

Area Units

Gravity and Ships _
All ships are assumed to have gravitic compensators
(sometimes called by other names, such as inertial compensators or dampeners). These incredibly sturdy machines
placed throughout a ship's hull keep the ship from being
torn apart whenever the pilot makes high-G turns -- and
it makes life a lot longer for the crewmembers as well. Perceived gravity is simply an extra function of the system that
simulates normal Human gravitic forces (things will fall
toward the ﬂoor area when you drop them). Ships can be
built without perceived gravity, but they may never forego
gravitic compensators.
See page 72 of this book for suggestions on dealing
with gravities other than 1 G.

Dropping Life Support and Gravity _
Though we call certain sections of the ship"life-support
modules," this is merely a term of convenience. It may be that
you're designing a small ﬁghter and you're not interested in
having oxygen or pressurization in the cockpit. In that case,
the pilot had best make sure he's wearing an environmental
suit (see the enviro-suit entry on page 104 of the D6 Space
Rulebook for details on one kind).
If this is the case, the mass of each cubic meter of nonlife supported area changes. Getting modules without the
equipment for perceived gravity or atmosphere reduces the
mass of the area to 0.4 tons per cubic meter. Cutting both
lessens the tonnage to 0.3 tons per cubic meter.

This chapter contains basic lists of components available for
space-faring vessels. They're meant to provide a starting point
from which to begin creating your own ships. Use the descriptions to come up with your own variant or new modules.
There are some characteristics of ship components that
deserve some explanation before continuing on.

The area units indicate how much space that each component
takes up. Each area unit is one meter wide, one meter long,
and three meters high. The mass gives a measure of how much
material is packed into each area; generally, the lower the mass,
the more empty space it contains.

Mass
The mass of a given component describes, in metric tons,
how much material that area contains and how much that piece
adds to the total tonnage of the ship. In most cases, this is not
a straight weight value but more of a size and complexity value.
Each component not only requires itself to operate but support
systems throughout the ship to make it all work together.

Energy Draw and Energy Units
Energy units (or "eu") are the amount of power that it takes
to run that component. This power comes from either the
main plant of the ship or a support plant designated for that
component.
The energy draw column of each module is in energy units.
Energy units hardly ever come into play, though it's possible
to reroute power from some systems to others to increase their
effectiveness. For game mechanics on this, see the "Ship Travel
and Combat" chapter.

Cost
The prices associated with each module are listed in credits, a
generic unit of monetary measurement that presumes that purchasing ships is a relatively difficult thing to do. For campaigns
where the ownership of star-faring vessels is more common,
divide the ﬁnal cost by 5, 10, or 100 -- the larger the divisor,
the easier it is to get a ship.

Life-Supporting and Cargo
Module Descriptions

Using this list of modules, you should be able to create a
vessel that suits the role that you have determined for it.
Each square meter of a vessel's life-supporting and cargo space
includes ceiling and ﬂoor panels, cables, conduits, wiring, and so

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 2
Notes: Make the crew buy a brig.

Miniaturization _
Smaller and yet equally functional versions of each
module described are available (in some settings) at an
increased cost. For every percentage smaller the miniaturized module is, increase the cost by an equal amount. So,
a module 10% smaller is 10% more expensive. (Round all
values up to the nearest 10 credits.)
on, so the open area is actually closer to 2.5 meters high, which
is enough room for the average species to stand upright.
Each room, including hallways, has one pressure door to allow
the area to be sealed off from the rest of the ship in case of a
puncture in that area. Hallways may have protective forceﬁelds
instead of doors in those settings that allow such devices.
If you need a larger version of any module, buy the module
several more times until you get the desired size.
Example: If you're building a starship with a crew of ﬁve and
want the bridge to accommodate all ﬁve crewmembers simultaneously, buy the standard bridge module (which supports a single
crewmember) ﬁve times. This area now supports ﬁve people,
takes up 20 area units, masses 10 tons, and a costs of 500.
Buying additional modules is also the method for increasing
the luxuriousness of the vessel. The modules as described are
the basic models, created for maximum efficiency and minimum wasted space. If you want the crew to have more room
to move around, or you're creating the opulent grandeur of a
noble's yacht, then design the ship as if it were intended to support more people than it will. For instance, you could buy two
"one-person rooms" to create a single "stateroom," which would
feature more amenities such as a couch, a personal entertainment system, and so on.
The accompanying table lists each type of module, the number
of people that the module supports, the number of area units
that the module occupies, and its cost. The ﬁgures presented
are for a single module of that type; multiple modules would
combine their ﬁgures.

Life-Supporting Modules
Each square meter of life-supported area masses half a metric
ton. This approximation is a good average between the empty
parts (which have very little mass) and more complex parts, like
furnishings, electrical, heating and cooling, atmosphere- and
ﬂuid-recycling, and food-processing equipment.
The energy units listed with each module show the number
needed to ﬁlter and recycle atmosphere, provide heat and light,
and generate artiﬁcial and perceived gravity for that area.
Airlock: Airlocks on space-faring vessels allow the crew to
get outside the vessel without forcing everyone inside to put
on environmental suits. Most are little more than two meters
square and are sealed with doors of the same basic Toughness
as the ship itself. Note that airlocks are not designed to be lived
in -- they can hold and support up to ﬁve people (per unit),
but they do not provide food and water or sleeping areas. The
module includes the inner and outer seal and all compression

File Name: Revised Ship Design
Notes: Small parts or big state room?

and decompression equipment. All airlocks require activation
by the crew (whether via coded keypads, retinal scan, etc.), but
they can sometimes be bypassed by unauthorized personnel
through use of security. (The difficulty depends on the security
measures used, but a value of 25 is typical.)
Boarding Tube: Boarding tubes are used to join to another
ship and provide a means of getting between them. The tube
is usually connected to airlocks (both purchased separately) at
both ends so internal atmosphere and pressurization is rarely
lost. Adding an airlock to the target-ship-side of the tube ensures
that a matching airlock is not needed; the boarding tube's airlock
will seal itself to the hull of the target ship.
The standard boarding tube is one meter wide and expands
to six meters long, just large enough for one person at a time to
walk through. It folds into half its size in the ship when not in
use. Increasing the size increases the difficulty to use it.
To successfully use a boarding tube, the two vessels must
match speeds. See the "Boarding" section on page 20 of chapter
1 for details.
Bridge/Duty Station, Standard: The standard bridge or
duty station contains a cushioned swivel chair bolted to the ﬂoor
with a computer interface and display panel in front of it and a
little room in which to move around. Additional duty stations
may be included by purchasing this module for the appropriate
number of people. For ships with only one crew, the captain
serves all duties and runs the entire ship from the bridge. In
larger ships, the duty stations that control various functions
(such as sensors or weapons) may be within the bridge (and
represented by a bigger bridge), scattered throughout the ship
(as individual modules), or both. As a luxury upgrade, bridges
and duty stations can come with processors for rations of food
and water for crewmembers who want to live or spend considerable time at their station. Many larger vessels place dedicated
duty stations at locations throughout the ship. For example, a
weapons battery may have a gunner's position linked to it, or
there may be a large duty station closer to the drive systems
that's used by the engineering crew.
Bridge and duty stations come with the minimum controls
and computer processing necessary to get the ship moving;
they give no aid to the user's abilities. To provide better sensor,
communication, or processing programs, see"Module Upgrades"
later in this chapter.
Bridge/Duty Station, Compact: Similar to the standard
bridge or duty station in terms of function, the compact version
requires that the crewmember sit, lie ﬂat, or stand in a minimal
amount of space. There is no room in which to move around
in. Generally, the crewmember climbs into the area through a
small opening, though this module could also represent oneperson duty stations that require the crewmember to stand
while using it.
Brig: This is a specialized holding cell for prisoners. It has
two bunks, a single-person toilet room, a little space to move
around in, and security measures, such as secure locks or a
force-ﬁeld generator barring the door.
Bunks, Communal: These are four bunks stacked two high
with moving space between each set. The room also features a

Coldsleep Module: Coldsleep modules are self-contained,
self-powered, computer-regulated "sleeper-coffins," which keep
the occupant standing in a state of suspended animation for long
journeys (thereby requiring less life-support costs). A cold-coffin
can usually operate for 25 years after the ship's power is shut
down. The beds provide nutrients (at a reduced rate) directly
into the sleeper's system. Adding a battery to the system (see
"Power Plant" later in this chapter) can increase the amount of
time the cold-coffin sustains its occupant by 25 years for each
energy unit devoted to the coldsleep module.

Inﬁrmary: This fully equipped two-bed hospital
has an array of medications and medical equipment,
including computerized health monitors and equipment for performing surgeries.
Laboratory: This is a generic term for any sort
of area dedicated to science or research. Note that
the number of people is the amount of persons that
can reasonably work in this area, though it may
service many more. The cost includes an array of
specialized scientiﬁc equipment, depending upon
the focus of the lab.

Leisure Room: This room can be ﬁtted with
one of the following: audio-visual equipment
plus comfortable chairs and a small selection of
entertainment scholarchips; exercise equipment;
shooting range with light-based weapons; observation window; meditation room or chapel; sauna; casino; or
equipment for another form of entertainment (such as holographic entertainment in those settings that have them). Add
additional modules of this room to create larger versions or
house bigger-sized equipment (such as a pool, with a cover that
folds over when not in use). This area is sometimes combined
with the lounge to create a deluxe lounge.

* The ﬁrst number is the amount of space the boarding tube takes up in the
ship; the second number indicates the length when extended. Use only the ﬁrst
number when calculating ship area. ** See entry for qualiﬁers on this.

35

Hydroponics: Some larger vessels come
equipped with garden areas, hydroponic labs where
vegetables and fruit are grown. The food provided
by these plants can be used to feed the crew, and the
plants themselves recycle the atmosphere (thus the
negative value for the number of people that the
room supports). Every four area units of hydroponics provides food for one Human-sized person. This
provision is indeﬁnite, though the garden requires
tending and the occasional expense of fertilizing
and reseeding. Larger vessels use hydroponics to
cut down on the amount of life-support equipment
they need to carry.

Hallway: Purchased in one-meter-square increments, some
ships use hallways to separate various rooms and allow their
occupants or users privacy from others moving about the ship.
This modules also represents elevators (or lifts), service corridors and tubes, and spare storage. A decent estimate of needed
hallway space for wide corridors is four to six area units for every
life-supporting and cargo room the ship has. (This is regardless
of the number of modules used to make up the room.) Halve
this if you want narrow passageways.
As long as the number of area units of hallway is less than
the number of area units in other modules on the ship, the hallway has a value of zero people when determining the amount
of breathable atmosphere needed. Otherwise, it has a value of
one person per area unit.

Lounge: The basic lounge includes a table and chairs for the
crew with a little space to stretch or have discussions. It does
not include entertainment systems or the like. Food processing
is a luxury upgrade. Lounges are most commonly used as mess
facilities for the ship's crew or ready rooms for the captains.
Medical Bed: This is a smaller version of the inﬁrmary. It
contains a single bed equipped with medical sensors and medication dispensers. It's too small to perform surgeries in.
Passenger Seating: This area contains two seats designed to
hold passengers for short hops (less than 10 hours). The module
also has a large view screen (the contents of which the captain
controls) and a single-person toilet room. As a luxury upgrade,
the area can include a snack dispenser. For every additional pair
of seats, add two area units, one ton, and 100 credits.
Room, Two-Person: This dormitory-style room contains
two bunked beds, a single toilet room, a single shower room,
two small desks, and two narrow lockers. Food processors, if
included, are standard. Most crewmembers and passengers
usually share two-person rooms.

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 2
Notes: Crew is grumpy without hallways.

Room, One-Person: As above but designed for one person.
Officers, the captain, wealthy passengers, or high-ranking crew
who spend a lot of time on board usually have a room of their
own. Captains often have staterooms created from two of these
modules, occasionally connected to a private dining lounge on
larger vessels.

Specialized: These cargo areas include vehicle launch
platforms, hangars, or any other space dedicated to a speciﬁc
function. These are by far the most complex and costliest cargo
spaces. They include multiple power coupling systems, terminals connected to the ship's computer, and other amenities that
contribute to the section's purpose.

Workroom: This is a generic term for any sort of area
dedicated to such things as small equipment repair, kitchens
(for nonprocessed food), laundry services, libraries, and so on.
Note that the number of people is the amount of persons that
can reasonably work in this area at the same time, though it
may service many more. Workrooms are sometimes equipped
with food processors (especially on independent ships), though
this is not standard.

Types

Cargo Modules
Cargo space covers all extra open areas within a spaceship. This
includes areas for portage and equipment, parking for vehicles
or small ships, and so on. The size of the hangar, launch bay,
and vehicle bay can be enlarged by up to 75% of their original
size by including additional bulk space modules. (Increases of
over 75% need to purchase the full module again.)
The mass of the cargo is already ﬁgured into mass of the
modules, and they are ﬁtted with gravitic compensators that
offset the additional mass when the bays are loaded.
Use the "# of People" column in the "Cargo Modules" chart to determine atmosphere that each cargo
module requires if the captain doesn't want the crew
to be in environmental suits all of the time. This also
indicates the maximum number of beings that the
unit can support.
Captains who want to forego the expense of putting
atmosphere in cargo space should be sure to put an airlock
between the cargo space and the rest of the ship, just in
case a crewmember needs to get at the area while in space.
The area may be ﬁlled with atmosphere when docking at
station; this costs 10 credits or more per day.

Classiﬁcations
Basic: They may have walls, doors, and power couplings, but basic sections are mostly designed for holding
large amounts of ever-changing goods in many different
sizes and masses. Most freighters and interplanetary haulers have thousands of tons of basic cargo space.
Segmented: This cargo space is generally designed
for ships that haul the same kinds of cargo repeatedly.
Ships that haul livestock, vehicles (that don't require
power), or other stock most often have segmented
cargo compartments. When building a ship, the
designer may divide up the cargo area as he sees ﬁt,
within reason. This can include multiple gantries and
walkways, cranes and lift systems, and so on. Automated
systems for off loading and more sophisticated devices
will have to be paid for, but portable lifts and simpler equipment are standard.

File Name: Revised Ship Design
Notes: Reorganize the cargo bay. . . again.

Each ammo bay holds up to one ton of ammunition, which
is already ﬁgured into the mass of the bay.
Bulk Space (basic): General cargo areas (which hold about
2.5 cubic meters per module) and personnel storage and weapons
lockers fall under bulk space. They include simple power outlets
and cables for bolting down stock. Bulk space used for storage
has at least one door for loading and off-loading the cargo, plus
another for accessing the rest of the ship.
Ship designers often include extra bulk space in their vessels
because the space is so easy to convert to other types of areas
after ship construction.
Exoskeleton Bay (specialized): This area can store one
personal exoskeleton up to ﬁve meters tall and less than two
meters wide. The area has automatic clamps to hold the suit
in place, a power-recharging unit, and space for the user to get
into or perform basic service on the suit.

1. Life support for bulk space is purchased at a rate of 1 person for every 4
area units (round up); increase this ratio if the area is frequently occupied, such as
refugee quarters or ship building.
2. Area unit is 6 meters tall with 5 meters of usable interior height. When
determining total area units, count these modules twice.
3. Cost includes food and atmosphere for two months for one person.
Hangar (specialized): A hangar holds a ﬁghter-sized craft
that's up to four meters tall, takes up 30 meters square, and weighs
no more than 60 tons. (Combine two instances of this module
to create one appropriately sized for a shuttle.) It includes room
for minor maintenance. At least one launch bay is required in
addition to hangar space, though one launch bay can serve a
large hangar made of several of these modules.
Launch Bay (specialized): This bay can launch a single
ﬁghter-sized ship no more than four meters tall and up to 30
area units. (Combine two of these modules to make one suitable for launching a shuttle.) It includes ﬂight control booths,
terminals, guidance systems, exterior doorways, and all other
devices necessary to send and receive spacecraft. (For example,
in settings were such exist, the exterior doorways have atmosphere-retention forceﬁelds. In other settings, the crew must
evacuate the area before a ship may launch.) No ships are stored
here. Multiple hangars can be serviced by a single launch bay,
but military vessels often carry many or large launch areas, to
get their ﬁghters into space more quickly.
Livestock Bay (segmented): One large animals (up to half a
ton each) can live comfortably in this 7.5-cubic-meter bay. This
room includes perceived gravity and atmospheric controls.
Matter Teletransporter (specialized): Some game settings
allow for instantaneous transportation of material. This unit
can transport about half a metric ton of material that's less than
one meter by one meter by 2.5 meters. Multiple units can be
combined to create a teletransporter service station or a larger
pad. One teletransporter (regardless of the number of modules
it contains) requires a duty station to operate it. The difficulty to
transport matter with the unit starts at Easy and increases due
to distance, energy interference, complexity of the transported
material, and so on. Gamemasters may impose restrictions on

teletransportation distance (due to the limits
of beam degradation, device components, or
another reason).
Pod Bay (specialized): An escape pod,
which can hold one person, takes up about six
cubic meters of space with all of its dedicated
terminals and rescue-courier launchers. The
escape pod includes a distress beacon, which
activates automatically and lasts for up to 25
years. It contains enough food and breathable
atmosphere to keep the occupant alive for two
months. Combine multiple instances of pods to
create units suitable for larger groups. It has no
easily accessible controls, but it is programmed
to land on any available planet with a breathable atmosphere. If no such planet is within a
two-month voyage, the escape pod maintains
its position.

Vehicle Bay (specialized): This is a garage
designed to house and secure a normal-sized
land or water vehicle (no more than four meters
tall and seven meters in length plus width). The
crew should buy additional tools and fuels as
desired. Included in the purchase price is a bay door for getting
the vehicle into and out from the bay.
Halve this module for a smaller bay suitable for a motorcycle
or small hover skiff.

Life-Support Equipment
The modules listed do not include supplies (just the hardware); the ship's owner will need to purchase those separately.
The table below lists the module types, as well as the supplies.
Many modules suggest that they could contain food-processing units. The initial installation fee covers the cost of having
these actually installed, if so desired, as well as putting the food
into the area. If the ship includes food stores, then at least one
room should have a food processor installed in it.

Atmosphere
To get the total cost for breathable atmosphere, add the
number of people that the modules will support (regardless of
whether people will be using those modules constantly, or even
whether those modules are being used by the full complement
of people or are just luxury upgrades); do not count the number
of people that food supplies support. (This number is referred
to as "person-areas" in the sample ships.) Then multiply that
by 100 credits. Take the resulting ﬁgure, and multiply this by
the number of month's worth of atmosphere needed. This is
the total cost of including atmosphere in the ship. (The weight
and storage of the air is already ﬁgured into the area and mass
of the ship.)
Example: A very small transport might have a compact
bridge (which supports one person) and six modules of bulk
cargo space. The six modules, presumably full most of the time,
don't require as much atmosphere as life-supporting areas. To

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 2
Notes: Can't live on snacks alone. . .

ﬁgure out how many persons' worth of atmosphere is
needed, multiply the total number of bulk space units
by 0.25 and round up. In the case of six modules, the
total "person-areas" is 2 (6 x 0.25 = 1.5, round up).
Note that atmosphere and its cost does not represent a delivery person showing up to the ship with a big
canister labeled "Air, One (1) Month" -- breathable
gases are part of it, but primarily what you're paying
for is the upkeep and repair of scrubbers and ﬁlters
that reduce the carbon dioxide build up within the
ship's atmosphere.
For simplicity, the mass and storage area of the
atmosphere is ﬁgured into the mass and area of the
modules.

Food Supplies
The food storage room is a temperature-controlled area for
keeping provisions. Automated selectors shunt the supplies to
the appropriate food processors or the kitchen.
For food processing, multiply the number of people in the
crew plus the maximum number of additional passengers (not the
total number of people that the modules can hold) by the cost per
month for the number of months' worth of food required. You'll
need one storage unit for each ﬁve months of snack or standard
food or 2.5 months of luxury food. The food itself adds to the
mass of the storage unit, so the total tonnage of food should be
less than or equal to the total tonnage of storage. (Divide
the mass of the food supplies by 0.5 and round up to
determine the number of storage units needed.) The
storage unit doesn't require atmosphere.

to serve. The better the equipment or data available, the bigger
the bonus it gives to the user. These upgrades give their users
a +1 pip bonus to relevant skill use with an installation cost of
200 credits and a energy unit draw of one per die or fraction
thereof. (Remember that a bonus of three pips equals a bonus
of +1D.)
Example: A +2 pip bonus costs 600 credits and has an energy
unit draw of 1, while a +1D+1 bonus costs 1,200 credits and
has an energy unit draw of 2.

Example: A pleasure yacht might have enough
food supplies for 15 people for two months. If the ship
owner decided to supply only luxury food, she would
need six tons of supplies (0.2 tons x 2 months x 15
people). This would be stored in 12 area units of storage
(6 tons of food/0.5 tons of food per unit = 12 units).
The units themselves have a mass of six tons.

36

Surviving on Snack Food
Snack food may be cheaper, but it's not nearly as
healthy as full meals. Anyone who tries to subsist on only
snack foods must make an Easy stamina roll each day
or be at -1 to all totals for the rest of the day. Characters
who eat at least one full meal a day (more if they're participating in strenuous activities) get adequate nutrition.
(Gamemasters may wish to impose long-term effects for
diets that rely too heavily on snacks.)

Cyber Interface
Those with neural-jacked crew can accommodate them by
including a cyber interface. For a cost of 2,000 credits per interface,
this allows a character with a neural jack to directly connect to the
computer. The captain may restrict access to select users.

Autofunction Program
To create drone ships or automated outposts, an autofunction
program can be added to the bridge. It's a complex artiﬁcial intelligence routine that allows the ship to handle itself in nearly any
circumstance covered by its limited programming. For example,
an autopilot program ﬂy itself through most situations without
a pilot. Though it can follow preprogrammed routines, it doesn't
improvise very well. (Gamemasters may wish to add a modiﬁer to
the difficulty of situations that almost, but not quite, lie outside
its programming.) On a failure with a Critical Failure, it could
become confused. An autopilot program, for example, might
move its ship into a tactically dangerous position.
The autofunction program begins with 3D in each of two
skills. For example, an autopilot program would have piloting
and gunnery. An autoresearch program would have sensors and
investigation. Autofunction programs can be combined.
Of course, having good equipment and cutting-edge software
is no substitute for good personnel. As a result, any program
that can take the place of a crewperson can only do so well. Not
only can the program never get a better result than the difficulty,
do not use the Wild Die when determining the program's success. Character and Fate Points also may not be spent on the
program's attempts.
Programming the autofunction program with one routine
(such as a single ﬂight pattern) requires a computer interface/repair
roll against a difficulty of 5. Each additional subroutine (such as
another ﬂight plan, the control of one weapon, or the examination
of another part of its area) increases the difficulty by 5.
Autofunction programs do require periodic maintenance to
insure they continue to function properly.

Luxuriousness

thousands of credits (for major ones). Nothing of any signiﬁcant size can be added to the room. Instead, this upgrade fee
represents various additions to modules. In living quarters,
it could be an adjustable bed or chair, wall hangings or other
art, soundprooﬁng, individual climate control, soundsculpting, compact entertainment system, security, or viewscreen or
port. In a leisure room, it might mean better or more complex
exercise equipment or a better entertainment library. In a bridge
or duty stations, this might represent food processors, voice or
holographic interaction, security features (including anti-hacking programs), drive ﬁeld expansion program, distress beacon,
ship identiﬁcation transponder, or cryogenic capabilities (for
compact bridges and escape pods only). In cargo bays, it might
account for automated loading systems, storage racks, climate
control, security, the ability to detach cargo modules, and so
on. In settings that use interstellar gates instead of interstellar
drives, codes or an activation device for gaining access to the
gates would be considered a "luxury" upgrade.

Other Features
The"Quirky Ships" chapter furnishes some addition options
for personalizing the newly acquired vessel.

Weapon Modules

The core of adventure is conﬂict, and conﬂict among the stars
means space combat. Nearly every ship the players' characters
encounter in a science-ﬁction universe has ship-to-ship weapons on
board. Indeed, most space-faring vessels of any signiﬁcant tonnage
at all have at least one weapon built in -- and usually more.
One station can control all weapons, but a person may only
ﬁre one weapon per action. This is one reason that large ships
often have multiple weapon stations.
Starship weapons fall into two categories: energy and projectiles. Energy weapons inﬂict damage through the application of
some form of electromagnetic radiation, and projectile weapons
launch solid objects.
The "Weapon Modules" chart provides a list of the most
common varieties and their game characteristics, including their
required area units, energy cost, mass, range, and damage. Use
the chart as a starting point for developing new weapons speciﬁc
to the desired universe.
The weapon descriptions don't specify exact appearance; this
is left up to the designer. As one example, blaster and laser cannons might look like one large weapon or several smaller ones
that ﬁre at the same time (but that can't be ﬁred individually).
For each weapon, a ﬁring arc needs to be designated. Weapons
can ﬁre port side, starboard side, rear, or perpendicular (and
away from the vessel). Of course, not all arcs are appropriate
for all weapon placements. Swivel mounting the weapon in a
turret to get additional arcs costs an extra 200 credits and one
additional energy unit per additional ﬁre arc.
Example: To ﬁre in four directions costs 600 credits -- three
extra arcs -- and another three energy units.
A ship's computer can aid with ﬁring a weapon. See the
"Modules Upgrade" section for details on improving the ship's
computer.

Most weapons can't lock on anything less than one space unit
from them, with the exception of point-defense guns, which are
designed for this purpose. (In some settings, gamemasters may
allow weapons to target ships at less than one space unit, possibly
at a greater difficulty due to the increased challenge of following
something moving quickly over a short distance.)

Conﬁgurations
Cannons, point-defense guns, and tractor beam projectors
may ﬁre from one or more barrels closely grouped together.
Unless individual guns are ﬁre linked, the gunner may not ﬁre
individual barrels of a multi-barrel gun.

one of these, and it must be placed near its associated launcher.
Auto-loaders within feed the ammunition to the proper weapon
in one round. The size and mass of each ordinance are included
in the size and mass of the ammo bay.

Blaster Cannons
A blaster cannon is an energy weapon that ﬁres a pulse of
coherent radiation toward the target. This pulse maintains
cohesion over very long distances, and so as a result, blaster
cannons are favored long-range weapons. The energy required
to hold the pulse together, however, results in the weapon doing
less damage than other similarly priced energy weapons once it
actually strikes the target.

Laser Cannons
Laser cannons are energy weapons that ﬁre a beam of charged
particles toward a target. Any beam weapon falls under this category, whether or not it actually is a true "laser" as it's technically
deﬁned. Laser weapons are not effective at extreme distances,
but they make up for their shorter ranger by packing more of a
punch than blaster cannons. More of the energy directly carries
through to the target upon a successful strike.

35

Machine Cannon

36

Machine cannons ﬁre solid projectiles. They're cheap for the
damage, but they are limited to about 20 rounds of constant use
before running out of ammunition. They are capable of burst
or automatic ﬁre, but they can't ﬁre single shot.
The "Ammo" column indicates how much ammunition can
be stored in the ammo bay. The ammunition must be purchased
separately; it's not included in the weapon price.

Mines
Mines are missile warheads with command, impact, and
proximity detonators set adrift in space to damage passing
ships. The detonators are activated when the pod is launched.
Any ship or large, metal body within one space unit of the mine
attracts and detonate it. (Anything, regardless of the composition,
running into it also detonates it.) They have battery-operated
jets that hold them in position for up to a week. After that, the
relatively tiny mines drift where gravity pulls them.
Mines are dangerous weapons. They're tiny, they emit very
little power, and they have radar-reﬂective paint and surfaces.
This is a combination which makes them extremely difficult to
detect. Their stealth rating is 24. The difficulty drops to 12 if
the mine has locked on.
All this makes mines bad for enemy ships, but the real danger
stems from the sheer number of mines deployed in previous
conﬂicts and the fact that they don't always disappear when they
ﬂoat away. Some burn up in planetary atmospheres while others
are hit by asteroids, but most of them simply ﬂoat around until
they encounter an unsuspecting ship and explode.
The detonators can remain active for years. Fighting ships
have deployed mines of one sort or another in every protracted
conﬂict since beings ﬁrst traveled to the stars, and any piloting
misfortune at the end of an interstellar trip could easily indicate

an unexpected encounter with a forgotten mine. For this reason
if for no other, smart skippers emerge from a jump with their
shields up.

Missiles
A missile launcher is a weapons rack that holds one independently targeted, self-propelled rocket. Additional missiles
are stored in nearby ammo bays, which automatically load the
next missile into the launcher. The range and damage of the
weapon varies, depending upon the warhead carried by the
individual missile.
A missile launcher does not come with a missile; this must
be added separately. Additional missiles may be purchased, one
for each ammo bay connected to the missile launcher.
For ships that drop bombs, the missile launcher ﬁring arc is
"down." The missiles are either passive homing or nuke.
Passive Homing: This missile homes in on a target using
the ﬁring ship's sensors for targeting. If the ﬁring ship's sensors are deactivated or destroyed, or the communications link
between the missile and the ﬁring ship is severed in some way,
the missile self-destructs.
Active Homing: This missile has its own sensor suite on
board, and therefore it doesn't rely on a communications relay
with the ﬁring ship. It uses its own sensors to home in on its
target, but those sensors are rudimentary, and can be fooled by
noisemakers.
Cluster: This missile carries three independent warheads.
Within one space unit of the target, the missile splits into three
separate payloads, each of which is capable of delivering a 4D
strike against the target. Point-defense systems must destroy
each incoming warhead to avoid damage. Cluster missiles are
considered active homing for the purposes of noisemakers.
Nuke: This missile is a passive-homing rocket armed with a
nuclear warhead. It can be targeted at either an individual vessel or an area in space. (In the event of a miss, the gamemaster
determines where the detonation actually occurs, if any -- usually
no more that 1D space units away from the target point. ) Upon
detonation, the nuke does its full damage to all targets within
two space units, half damage to all targets more than two but

Variable Settings _
Some campaigns permit variable payloads on torpedoes
or variable settings on their energy weapons. Generally adding no additional cost to the weapon, some gamemasters
may increase the price by 50% or more to reﬂect that it's
"cutting edge" technology.
Switching between settings requires a simple (no-roll
or Wild Die–only) action in most circumstances. Fine
tuning a weapon calls for a gunnery repair roll and several
rounds or minutes of ﬁddling with the wiring, programming, relays, or other components. (The difficulty depends
on how far from normal speciﬁcations the adjustment is,
with a minimum difficulty of Easy.)

less than three space units away, and quarter damage to targets
three to four units away. Targets ﬁve or more units distant
from the explosion take no damage. The radiation also
scrambles all communications, neutralizes all battery
power sources, deadens all control systems, and jams
all sensors of all targets within three space units
of detonation. The effect lasts for 2D hours. Most
places ban these warheads due to their devastating
and long-lasting effects.

Noisemaker: This missile can be directed to travel
to anywhere up to 10 space units distant from the launching vessel. It matches the speed of the launching vessel
(at the time of launch; no speed corrections are possible
after launch), and it releases an electronic scream of white
noise for up to 10 rounds. (It can be turned off by the
launching ship.) The noisemaker confuses the sensors
of other missiles, increasing the difficulty of attack rolls
by +6D (+18) for active-homing missiles. Noisemakers
can also make enemy sensor operations difficult (+1D or
+3 difficulty modiﬁer). This includes attempts to locate
or target the launching vessel with energy weapons or
passive-homing missiles.

29

Sensor Decoy: Sensor decoys send out signals to
fool other ships' sensors. They are ejected with a preprogrammed course and have a space Move of 5. Their
power plants last for about an hour before burning
out. The base sensors difficulty of determining which
is the real ship and which is the decoy is Moderate.
They have a Toughness of 4D and beating it by 12
points of damage results in its destruction.

36

Point-Defense Guns
Point-defensive systems are specialized, rapid-ﬁre energy
weapons designed speciﬁcally to target small objects close to the
vessel. They are most commonly used to target incoming missile
weapons. The weapons controller does this by rolling gunnery
as a parry attempt against missile and torpedo attacks. One roll
works for all attacks that happen after the gunner makes the
"parry" attempt. Instead of using the combat difficulty number
to hit, the missile ﬁrer makes the attempt against the gunnery
roll. Use the same rules as for a character's parry, including full
and partial parry actions.
Projectiles that miss the gunnery difficulty explode at two
space units from the defending ship. If the projectiles get through
anyway, the damage is ﬁgured as normal against the vessel's
shields, armor, and hull.
Gunners can use point-defense guns against ﬁghters attacking
the vessel, though this counts as a separate action from destroying missiles. The "Weapon Modules" chart lists the ranges for a
point-defense gun used in this way.

Torpedoes
A torpedo launcher ﬁres an active-homing warhead that's
larger than the average missile. It features a sophisticated sensor package that can't be decoyed by noisemaker missiles. The
warhead is usually some form of massive energy-release weapon,

such as a mass-to-energy converter or an antimatter charge.
Its large payload results in a shorter effective range than other
missile weapons.
The launcher comes with one torpedo. Additional torpedoes
may be purchased, one for each ammo bay connected to the
launcher.

Sensor Probes
Sensor probes extend a ship's scanning capabilities and reduce
the risk to vessels in unknown space. Their main attraction is a
compact, battery-powered, forward-facing energy sensor with
a transmitter relay. The ship receives the data transmitted from
the pod and the software interprets it as if the ship had collected
it with its own sensors.
The pod is self-propelled, like a missile. It only moves at two
space units per round, but its drive has enough power to run for
ﬁve minutes. The probe transmits data for ﬁve days.
It's intended for launch from a ship moving no faster than
cautious speed. If the ship is moving faster, then the pod's launch
velocity increases accordingly. Doing this confuses the pod's
scanner, distorting its data and resulting in a steady supply of
misinformation.
The transmitter has a range of 200 space units. The launching ship can control the pod, telling it where to go and when to
stop, with a sensors roll. The difficulty starts at Easy for a probe

up to 25 space units away and increases by +1
for every additional 25 space units that the probe
travels from the ship.
Probe pods have scale of 1 and a Toughness
of 4D. Beating the Toughness by 12 or more will
destroy one, but they're hard to spot (stealth 20).
They're expensive, given their disposable nature,
but scouts love them because losing a pod is far
cheaper than losing the whole ship.

each additional +1D to the beam, add 4,000 credits, another
seven area units, 15 tons, and 10 energy units.
For more information on using tractor beams, see page 23
of this book.

Weapons Extras
In addition to a swivel mount (see the beginning of the
"Weapons" section for details), ordinance can have improved
ﬁring control or be ﬁre-linked.
For improved ﬁring control, the weapon needs a bridge or
duty station that has a gunnery skill bonus module upgrade.
(See the "Life-Supporting Modules" section earlier in this
chapter for details.)
Several weapons can be linked to ﬁre at the same target
simultaneously at a cost of 100 credits for each additional
weapon. (Gamemasters may wish to limit the number of ﬁrelinked weapons to four.) The weapons must be identical in type,
range, and damage. Fire-linking provides a die total bonus to the
damage of one weapon equal to 1 for every 2D in the total of
amount of damage for the set of ﬁre-linked weapons. (Round
down fractions.)
Example: An Erda-class strike ﬁghter has four ﬁre-linked
laser cannons. Each cannon deals 4D damage. The total damage for the set is 16, making the bonus +8 (16/2). When ﬁring
together at the same target, the weapons do 4D+8 damage.
The weapons may also ﬁre individually, but they don't get
the bonus.

Weapons and Scale _

49

Instead of a special mechanic to allow a small ship to
take on a larger one, designers can increase the power of
the weapons to allow the ship to do more damage against
a larger craft. A 1D increase in damage can offset about
a three-point scale modiﬁer to the target's damage resistance total.
Likewise, larger vessels can better attack smaller vessels
by improving the targeting ability of its guns. A 1D bonus
to gunnery can overcome about a three-point scale modiﬁer
to the combat difficulty.

Drive Modules

Drives, drawing energy from the power plant, move the ship
through space They can be anti-gravity propulsion, hyperspace
generators, or however the gamemaster wants to describe the
technology and physics behind it.
Ships have in-system (or sublight) drives and, sometimes,
interstellar.

In-System Drive
In-system drives propel a vessel through space at sublight
speeds. Even vessels capable of interstellar ﬂight need an in-system
drive to take over propulsion of the ship when it's maneuvering
within the conﬁnes of a star system.
The smallest in-system drive covers three area units, has a
mass of three metric tons, and has a cost of 2,500 credits. It
gives a space Move of zero. For each additional Move increase
of 1, the cost goes up by 1,000 credits and the cruising speed
energy requirement goes up by three.
Designers who want to push their craft to extreme speeds
frequently should be certain that their power plants can handle
it: Moving at all-out speed takes 2 times the normal amount.
(See the "Spaceship Movement" section on page 18 of chapter
1 for more details.)

Maneuvering Thrusters
Though the bulk of the in-system drive is housed in a single
section of the ship, a series of maneuvering jets and retros along
the ship allow it to turn in frictionless space. The basic system
included with ships provides the 0D in Maneuverability. Better
or additional thrusters increase the Maneuverability. Their size
is ﬁgured into the hull and as part of the rest of the ship. Each
improvement to the thrusters adds one pip to the Maneuverability
rating, with an energy draw of two units. (Remember that there
are three pips in one die.) The maximum Maneuverability of any
ship is 5D (unless the gamemaster speciﬁes otherwise).

Interstellar Drive
In game settings featuring many far-ﬂung star systems, the
characters will need a way to travel from one system to another.
Usually, this is accomplished by equipping vessels with interstellar drives. This drive allows space-faring vessels to make the

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 2
Notes: Add "ﬁx thrusters" to to-do list.

Driveless Interstellar Travel _
A campaign doesn't have to have vessels with interstellar drives to allow interstellar travel. The gamemaster may
choose to instead link the solar systems of her campaign
setting with a series of wormholes or jump gates -- areas
of space that, when passed through, will catapult any vessel
through a ﬁxed route to an adjoining area of space many
light-years away. In this way, ships without the ability to
travel faster than light under their own power can still
journey from system to system.
The jump gates might exist because interstellar drive
technology is too massive to ﬁt onto a vessel, or they may be
leftover relics of a long-dead alien civilization -- whatever
works best for the campaign.
Gamemasters may create the jump gates using the freeform method. To best simulate the gate using the standard
system, it requires a bridge (and possibly living quarters
for the crew, if the gate isn't automated), a small in-system
drive with minimal thrusters (for the occasional location
corrections), an interstellar drive, and enough additional
bulk cargo units to make the appropriately sized ring. The
total number of areas required equals 4 times the square
of half of the width of the largest vessel going through the
gate. This gives the ship plenty of room to move through
the opening.
Use the gate's interstellar drive as if it were the ship's.
If two gates are required, the gamemaster should ignore
navigation mishap results. If only one gate is required, then
the gamemaster may decide that a navigation failure with
a Critical Failure indicates that something went wrong
with the gate.

point A and point B, simply by going exceptionally fast. Other
common names for the warp drive are hyperdrives, lightspeed
drives, faster-than-light (FTL) drives, and the like.
Some gamemasters may disallow these drives, preferring
instead to focus adventures on a single system. For everyone
else, here are guidelines for adding them to the ship.
The interstellar drive must be located next to the in-system
drive, because the interstellar drive is actually an extension of that
system, drawing on the same power source but using it in a vastly
different way (as determined by the gamemaster). Interstellar drives
are ranked by ratings. Interstellar drives with low rating numbers
increase the amount of time it takes to reach a destination, while
high ones decrease it. Most civilian ships have a rating of 0.5 or
lower, and most military vessels have a rating of 1 or better.
The lowest rating a ship with an interstellar drive can have
is 0.1. It costs 5,000 credits. It takes up two area units, with a
mass of ﬁve tons and an energy requirement of 10. For each
additional 0.1 in rating, add one area unit, three tons of mass,
10 energy units, and 5,000 credits to the price.
Example: A cargo hauler has a drive that provides a 0.5
rating. The interstellar drive takes up six area units (two for
the basic plus four for the additions to the rating) and has a
mass of 17 tons (ﬁve for the basic plus 12 for the additions).
It requires 50 energy units (10 for the basic plus 40 for the
additions) and costs 25,000 credits (5,000 for the basic, plus
20,000 for the additions). The 50 energy unit cost would be
required for the length of the interstellar travel -- hopefully,
the ship designer allowed for this, otherwise the crew may end
up having to spend time in cold sleep because they can't pay the
cost of life support!
Example: A frigate has a drive that provides a 1.0 rating. The
interstellar drive takes up 11 area units (two for the basic plus nine
for the additions to the rating) and has a mass of 32 tons (ﬁve for
the basic plus 27 for the additions). It requires 100 energy units
(10 for the basic, plus 90 for the addition) and costs 50,000 credits
(5,000 for the basic plus 45,000 for the additions). You can begin
to see why only military vessels have such high ratings -- only
navies have the budgets for such expensive engines!
See page 13 of this book for tips on using interstellar drives
at less than their maximum rating (for those game settings that
offer this option).

miraculous leaps of distance that can shape the universe, crossing
the space in far less time than it would take using conventional
in-system drive systems. Regardless of the in-game explanation
for interstellar travel, most interstellar drives commonly fall into
two categories: the jump drive and the warp drive.
A jump drive is one where the vessel crosses the distance
between its origin and its destination by "jumping" from point
A to point B without ever crossing the intervening space. The
vessel winks out of existence, and re-enters the universe at its
destination, having "jumped" the gap in between. During the

You can design a stationary or permanently orbiting vessel
by giving it no drives. Some gamemasters may require that the
ship have a minimal in-system drive and thrusters for those
rare times that corrections are needed to maintain the vessel's
location.

Power Plant Modules

The power plants available to ships are as widely varied as the
ships themselves. They generate power from chemicals, ﬁssion,
fusion, solar cells, antimatter, or some other source entirely. The
gamemasters may determine the speciﬁcs for their own individual
game setting, if they so desire.
The smallest power plant covers two area units, has a mass
of two metric tons, and has a cost of 2,500 credits. It provides
25 energy units to the ship. Adding more power increases the
size by one additional area unit and two additional tons for
each extra 15 energy units, with a cost increase of 2,000 for
each upgrade.
The power generated from the plant is used to run all of the
systems on board the vessel. Ship designers must make sure that
their power generation meets their needs as if every system is
operating simultaneously. Obviously, systems like the interstellar drive will not be running constantly, and only need to draw
energy when in use, but ship designers need to make sure that
they don't ﬁnd themselves with an energy shortage, having to
juggle systems on and off.
Main power plants can last for about one year before needing
to be refueled. (Ships that don't use much of the energy output
can make the plants last longer.) Most give a warning -- such
as an audible signal, a ﬂashing light, or a computer-generated
message -- about one month before they quit.

Battery Backup
Battery plants are simply storage batteries that hold energy.
They are small and popular in short-run ﬁghters and shuttles.
They can charge off of larger plants at a rate of one minute per
energy unit generated. They can run for one day per energy
unit generated before needing to be recharged. Unused battery
plants keep their charge indeﬁnitely. Burned-out batteries, generally because they were overloaded in a massive power draw,
are replaced rather than repaired. Multiple units purchased

A Bigger Power Plant _
You might think that you can squeak by with a power
plant that generates the minimum amount required by
the ship. But when you're up against a pirate corsair twice
your size, you'll be glad you got the additional upgrade,
so you can:
> boost shields
> increase the movement rate
> expand the drive ﬁeld
> increase power to the weapons (if allowed by the
game setting)
Of course, a bigger plant also makes it easier to upgrade
the ship in the future.
may be considered part of a single battery or a linked series of
small batteries.

Burst Capacitors
Similar in size and capacity to battery backups, burst capacitors offer a brief "burst" of power to one system (generally the
drives). They are much cheaper than batteries, but once used,
they need to be replaced. They last for a number of hours equal
to their energy output. Designate whether multiple burst capacitors are part of one unit or a series of smaller units.

Shields and the Power Plant
Shields are one of the last components added to the ship.
Designers who want to have them in their vessels need to include
enough energy to power them. Shields have a draw of one energy
unit per pip of protection.
For more details on adding shields, see the "Shields" section
later in this chapter.

Exterior Accessories
Hull
The next step of starship design is to encase the modules that
make up the ship's interior with a hull that holds the whole thing
together and adds components for thrusters, weapon conduits
(to account for scale), compensators, and the like. Adding an
exterior casing does not increase the vehicle's size, but it does
add to the vessel's mass.
The mass of the hull equals half the mass of all the other
modules included in the ship so far. (Round up the module
mass total before determining mass of hull. Round up the
mass of the hull.) To ﬁgure out the cost of the hull, multiply
its mass by 500 credits.
Then, use the bulkhead's mass (not the total mass of the
entire vessel) to determine its base Toughness by reading
the ﬁgure on the accompanying chart. Round the number
of tons down when ﬁguring hull Toughness.
Example: A ship with a hull mass of 105 tons has a hull
Toughness of 2D+2, not 3D.

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 2
Notes: Threaten crew with rowing duties.

Body Points
Some gamemasters may prefer to use Body Points rather
than the vehicle Wounds system. To determine the number of
Body Points that the ship has, multiply the number in front of
the "D" in the ship's Toughness by 5, add the pips, and add 20.
Use scale, armor, and shields as normal.

Atmospheric Streamlining
Some vessels can operate within the atmosphere of a planet.
Gamemasters may decide that ships over a certain number of
modules may never enter the atmosphere, or they may ignore
that restriction entirely, as dictated by the details of the individual game setting.
A vessel streamlined for atmospheric capability is more
expensive than a nonatmospheric vessel --it increases the hull's
cost by 20% (that is, it costs 100 times the hull's mass). The
streamlining smooths out the rough edges and adds stubby
wings; it also increases the hull's mass by 25% (round up).
A vessel with atmospheric capability must have at least 2
times the base hull Toughness (armor plus shields) to protect
against the heat generated by re-entry.
Example: The design of the ship with a hull mass of 105 tons
decides to streamline the vehicle. This adds 27 tons to the mass
(105 x 0.25 = 26.25, rounding up to 27) and 10,500 credits to
the total cost (105 x 100).

Atmospheric Movement Rate
A ship's atmospheric speed generally relates to its capabilities
in space. To determine the base atmospheric movement rate,
multiply the ship's space Move by 50. Then use the table to
translate that value to kilometers per hour. Find the closest
atmosphere rate to get the corresponding cruising speed in
kilometers per hour. (Gamemasters may adjust this value as they
feel best represents the setting, including increasing the speed

effects on the planet's environment.

approximate number of meters per round.

Landing Gear
Characters who wish to have
their vessels touch down on planets
ought to include landing gear in their
ships. Stored along the underside of
the vehicle, these are activated when
the landing sequence is engaged. They
take a form appropriate for the setting,
such as sturdy, folding legs (possibly
with solid wheels) that drop out, or
a series of heavy-duty anti-gravity
compensators.
Since bigger ships need more
landing gear, mass of the gear is
based on the hull's mass. Though
the landing gear requires power to
deploy it, the need is minimal and
comes from power plant reserves or
systems that aren't used within the atmosphere (such as interstellar drives).

Stealth Options
Aside from sensor decoys (listed under weapons), ships can
use other means to hide themselves from other vessels.
Stealth paint increases the difficulty for other ships to detect
it by +5. It costs a number of credits equal to the hull's mass to
put it on. Damage to the ship's exterior, however, scratches the
paint, lowering its effectiveness by one point for each point over
the combat difficulty. Damaged paint must be replaced.
Jamming programs send out electrical signals that prevent
sensors from getting information about the vessel. For every
+1 to the sensor difficulty, the cost is 1,000 credits. A jamming
program requires a duty station.
Gamemasters can also use Special Abilities (such as Blur
and Invisibility) to simulate other stealth or cloaking features.
See the "Quirky Ships" chapter for details.

Armor
Ship designers who know that a vessel will be experiencing
a great deal of space combat often bolster the toughness of the
ship's hull by adding armor to it: riveting plates on the outside,
using better materials for the exterior, reinforcing bulkheads,
or improving the supports. Use the "Hulls" chart to determine
how much each additional pip of armor costs. The maximum
amount of armor a ship can have equals the base hull Toughness. (Remember that there are three pips in one die.) Armor
draws no energy but does add a number of tons equal to its
cost divided by 1,000.
Example: A 1,000-ton ship has a base Toughness of 4D+1.
Additional armor can be purchased, up to a maximum of 4D+1,
but that would cost 1.3 million credits (4D+1 is 13 pips, and
each pip costs 100,000 credits). Armor worth 4D+1 would add
1,300 tons (1.3 million divided by 1,000).
Hull armor (which includes the structure of the ship) needs to
be repaired -- or, more likely, replaced -- when it's damaged.

Shields
Space vessel shields work very much like hull armor (adding
to the damage resistance of the vessel), but they have an additional advantage -- unless the whole system is blown away, they
will usually only need to be ﬁtted with a few new components.
Enough damage can overload them, however; see the "Ship
Travel and Combat" chapter for details.

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 2
Notes: Sell crew organs for shields.

Energy shields are"bottles" that surround
a ship. The shield projectors work in conjunction to form this bubble.
Shields cover the four quarters of a
vessel (forward, aft, port, and starboard),
and the ratings can be divided among
those four quarters as the ship's captain sees ﬁt. (See the section on shield
deployment in the "Ship Travel and
Combat" chapter.)
The shield generator module costs 1.5
times the cost for adding armor, per pip, but
there is no maximum. (A three-pip increase
equals one die.) They have an energy requirement of one unit per pip. Divide the cost
by 10,000 to get the number of tons and
by 20,000 (round up) to get the number
of area units. These areas represent the
individual shield projectors, which are
spread over hull of the ship.
Shield-generator modules do not add
to the ship tonnage when determining the
hull Toughness.
Example: The 1,000-ton vessel could include a shield generator. If the generator provided the same 4D+1 in coverage
as the armor, it would cost 1.95 million credits (1.5 times the
cost of the armor), with an energy requirement of 13 units. The
generator would mass 195 tons (1.95 million credits divided by
10,000) and would take up 98 areas (1.95 million credits divided
by 20,000, rounding up), spread over the entire ship.

Shape and Size

There are an almost inﬁnite number of ways the modules
may be put together to form a vessels. Here are a few examples
and how to determine the approximate length of each.
Cylindrical: The ship is a few meters wide, a few meters
deep, and very long. (On graph paper, the area units would be
side by side.) Add together the number of area units of all the
modules, and divide by 2 to get the length.
Ellipsoid: Ships designed this way have a squashed-egg
appearance, a few meters deep and twice as long as they are
wide. To get the length, add together the number of area units
of all modules and divide by 3.
Spheroid: The area units of the modules are evenly divided
throughout two or more layers. Add together the number of
area units of all the modules and divide by 6 to ﬁgure out the
radius. Note that spheroid vessels are not normally capable of
atmospheric ﬂight.
Wedge-Shaped: The ship is a few meters deep and wider
at the tail than at the nose. To ﬁnd the length, add together the
number of area units of all the modules and divide by 4.
For other shapes, or vessels that use a combination of shapes
(for example, saucer shapes connected to cylindrical sections),
either draw out the section or simply use the ellipsoid formula,
which is close enough to what the average result would turn
out to be.

Determining the Scale
To ﬁgure out the scale of the ship, take the total tonnage and
compare it to the accompanying chart, following the instructions given with it.
If you're using freeform design and just listing length, multiply the length value by 10, 100, or 1,000, depending on the
size of the ship.
Example: The Zeus Machina (described in the sample ships
chapter) has a length of 1,500 meters. Since this is supposed to
be a really big ship, multiply by 1,000 to get the approximate
tonnage -- 1,500,000 tons. That has a scale value of 36.
Note that the chart works best for ships, though it can be
used as a starting point for determining the scale of other celestial
objects. However, if the designer or the gamemaster think that
something about the ship (such as a compact design or poorer
or better quality construction materials) warrant a different
scale value, feel free to make adjustments.

Determining the
Price Difficulty

After you have found the total cost of all components of the
vessel, divide the number by 10,000 (round up) and add 20 to
determine the price difficulty.
To purchase a ship, characters may pool their funds. The
group designates a primary purchaser, who will make the Funds
roll. This character must have at least 3D in Funds.
Characters supporting the purchaser decide how much of
their Funds they wish to contribute, in 1D increments. They then
roll this amount, modify the total by the Poverty Disadvantage
(if applicable), and divide that total by 5, rounding up.
Those with Wealth may contribute ranks of their Advantage
at a rate of +1 for each rank of Wealth provided.
The bonus adds to the purchaser's Funds total, not to the die
code. It may be used for the ship's purchase only.

Due to the high price of buying a ship, every character who
contributes to buying a ship loses access to those dice of Funds
for one week per die or rank of Wealth added.
Example: Shar and her pals want to get their characters a
shuttlecraft, which has a price difficulty of 27. Shar's character
has 4D in Funds, which, if she's lucky, will net her a 25. More
likely, she'll only get 12 to 16 on the roll. She cajoles the others
in her group to help out. Jim offers 2D of his character's 3D in
Funds and one rank of Wealth. He rolls 9, which translates to
a bonus of 2. His character's rank of Wealth means a bonus of
+1. Katrina puts in her character's entire 4D in Funds, rolling
17, for a bonus of +4. That gives Shar a roll-total bonus of 7,
which hopefully will be enough.
If Shar can buy the ship, her and Katrina's characters' Funds
scores will be at zero for four weeks. Jim's character will have

Using the Ship Scale Charts _
For ships of 10 tons or less, look up the tonnage on
the ﬁrst chart to the scale of the ship.
For ships over 10 tons, you'll need to do a little work
with one of two methods.
In the ﬁrst way, look up the ﬁrst two digits of the total
tonnage on the second chart. Then count the number of
digits after the ﬁrst two numbers and look up the modiﬁer on the second chart. Add together the numbers to get
the ship's scale.
Example: One type of light ﬁghter weighs 48 tons. The
ﬁrst two digits of its mass are 48, which has a base value
of 9. There are no digits after it, so it gets a modiﬁer of
+5. The scale value of the ship is the base value plus the
modiﬁer, or 14 (9 + 5).
If you prefer scientiﬁc notation or are working with very
large numbers, convert the tonnage to exponential format
with two signiﬁcant digits. Multiply the coefficient by 10
and look that number up on the ﬁrst of the second set of
charts to get the base value. Then, multiply the exponent
by 5 to get the value modiﬁer. Add the base value to the
value modiﬁer to get the scale value of the ship.
Example: Chiron, an asteroid in Earth's belt, has an
approximate diameter of 180 kilometers and an approximate mass of 40 trillion metric ton, or 4 x 1015 when
expressed in scientiﬁc notation. Multiplying the coefficient
by 10 makes 40, which has a base value of 8. Multiplying
the exponent of 15 by 5 gives a modiﬁer of 75. Adding them
together makes 83, which is the asteroid's scale value.
only 1D in Funds and no access to his Wealth for three weeks.
They better hope the characters don't run into trouble!
See the next chapter for suggestions on reducing the cost
of buying a ship.

Maintenance

Ships won't run forever without maintenance. Everyone knows
that life support units require recharging, reactors require refueling,
and weapons need reloading, but these steps are only part of the
equation. Drives require periodic inspection, sensors need recalibration, energy weapons need cleaning, and the computer demands
an occasional diagnostic checkup. Without this maintenance,
the ship will suffer drive failures, sensor burn-out, and random
computer errors before it unceremoniously falls apart. Granted,
the crew can do a lot of the work during the down time when the
ship travels between the stars, but the ship must still undergo a
thorough check of all systems at an atmospheric or orbital repair
facility at least once a year (except for overengineered long-range
exploration and military vessels that are built to withstand the
stresses of space travel for far longer periods and carry the spare
crew and components to effect such checks). This check costs
6,000 credits multiplied by number in front of the "D" of the
ship's hull Toughness. Ships bought used should have a check
done immediately in order to expose any malfunctions.

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 2
Notes: Must ﬁnd hidden plant shoots.

An Unexplainable Noise _
Gamemasters who need a way to shake the situation
on a ship should remember that technology isn't perfect:
A replaced part might be faulty (used more so than new).
It might be slightly incompatible with the existing parts.
The technician might not have got the installation quite
right. Or all of them . . .
If the check is delayed, on any shipboard setback (either from
a game-enhancing card result or because someone failed with a
Critical Failure), the vessel exhibits a new malfunction in addition
to any other ill results. For every month you delay the check, the
cost of it increases by 10% (+3 to the price difficulty).
All of this assumes you're ﬂying the ship conservatively.
Characters who take it into combat immediately bring on even
more repair expense. Even if the ship doesn't take damage from
weapon hits, combat maneuvering stresses ships to the limit.
Any time your ship engages in combat, you should schedule a
maintenance check immediately. Blowing it off has the same
effect as delaying a regularly scheduled inspection. Military ships
with extended missions usually rendezvous with repair vessels
to receive their maintenance on the ﬂy, but most folks probably
won't have that luxury. Naturally, they'll have to ﬁnd their own
repair facility, a task that should prove every bit as challenging
as actually buying the ship.

Repairs

Characters may attempt to effect repairs during combat, in
transit, or while docked in a safe haven. The base ﬂight systems
repair difficulty for ﬁxing damaged systems is 10. Use the
"Repair Modiﬁers" chart to alter this difficulty based on the
situation. All modiﬁers assume technicians have proper tools;
some toolkits provide up to a +1D bonus for those with the
ﬂight systems repair skill. Most starships carry at least one toolkit
and the most essential spare parts in storage lockers near the
engineering spaces. Most space-faring laws require captains to
maintain stocks of these materials, though casual enforcement,
lax resupplying, or ﬁnancial restraints do not always ensure such
materials remain on hand.
Use the accompany"Repairs" cost chart to get a general idea of
the price of ﬁxing the ship. Labor is extra; see the suggestions in
the "Docking and Repair Fees" section on page 9 of chapter 1.
Of course, the gamemaster has the ﬁnal say on the cost of
replacement parts (used parts cost less than new), the ability to
ﬁnd them, and the effectiveness of ﬁeld-expedient alternatives.

Modiﬁcations

Players will certainly want to improve their ship over the
course of the campaign. These modiﬁcations are limited by the
competency of the technicians involved, the design limitations
of the vessel, and the owner's available credits.
Armor may be improved up to a value equal to the hull Toughness. Life-support and cargo module upgrades (skill bonuses)
take up no additional space and have no limit on their alteration.

File Name: Revised Ship Design
Notes: Ship = black hole of credits.

Other components may be modiﬁed as long as there's space for
the upgrade and enough power coming from the plant.
Replacing components is also a possibility. Shipyards or parts
supply ﬁrms will give characters 5% of new cost for damage parts
(if they buy them at all), depending on extent of damage, and
15% of new cost for a used but serviceable part. They may give
an additional 5% to 10% if the part is in high demand.
The cost of modifying a component using new parts equals
the same cost as purchasing an upgrade for it at initial design.
Used or refurbished parts may reduce the cost.

What's in this Chapter

That new ship you're drooling is a shimmering mass of steel,
chrome, and blasters . . . and you can't afford it. Now what?
Or perhaps you want a ship with a few deﬁnitely nonstandard
items. How can you manage it?
This chapter discusses how to customize ships with Disadvantages, Advantages, and Special Abilities.

Disadvantages

As an optional rule, there is one possibility to reduce the
cost of a spacecraft . . . and that's to ﬁnd one with personality
and quirks. To represent this, the ship's designer may give
Disadvantages to the ship (or, in rare cases, the ship's owner).
For each rank given, deduct 1 from the ﬁnal price difficulty of
a vessel, or 10,000 credits. All Disadvantages so given must be
approved by the gamemaster, and should be considered carefully.
The ﬁnal cost of a vehicle can never be reduced to less than half
its total cost (rounded up) through Disadvantages.
Example: A pilot has her eyes on a sparkling new scout
ship, which has a price difficulty of 45. This is too rich for her
blood. However, the salesman does have a used version of that
model that was almost destroyed in a space battle; the repairs
have made its hyperspace drive unreliable. The salesman also
chuckles nervously that it might be "cursed." In fact, the ship
has Advantage Flaw (R2) and Bad Luck (R2), reducing its cost
to 41. Regardless of what else is wrong with the ship, its price
could never go below 23.

55

Here are some example applications of various Disadvantages:

56

> Achilles' Heel: This usually represents a vulnerability or
physical defect with the ship. Thus a ship with Rot may be held
together with duct tape and prayer, forcing its crew to periodically
pause to reassemble pieces; or Vulnerability (R3) might represent
a speciﬁc part that causes double damage if targeted (say, at +10
difficulty). Any Disadvantages that rely on an atmosphere require
the ship to be atmosphere capable. As an optional three-rank
Achilles' Heel, a ship may have one permanent, unrepairable
level of damage (starting at Very Light); additional permanent
damage may be acquired for additional ranks of Achilles' Heel
(three ranks per additional level of damage); in this case, the
vessel also suffers the effects of that level of damage, although
passengers do not suffer damage effects.

Salvage Ships _
Salvage shipyards are one way of getting a ship. Granted,
no shipyard has more than a dozen or so space-worthy
vessels to choose from but, hey, they sure are cheap.
The ships are almost always paid for, and they show
it. Ships that end up in one of these dives were probably
traded for a ticket on a safe liner inward, or enough credits
to set up a dirt farm or bar. In other words, these vessels
are dangerous.
Most of them have a permanent damage level or a
reduced system that cannot be repaired. Granted, this
means they cost well below that of "new" cost, but they
are dangerous and easily destroyed. Still, because most of
them are reconditioned freighters with maybe a little more
ﬁrepower than their original specs showed, they're ideal for
adventuring groups.
Seldom do these shipyards have vessels larger than a
big freighter or scout ship. Most are designed to land (or
crash) in an atmosphere, since the expense of an orbiting
station is not possible for these ship dealers.
Of course, all of these buys are "consumer beware."
Glitches and system ghosts are to be expected, looked for
-- and accepted. If you had the cash or opportunity, you'd
buy from a more respectable shipyard or you'd go to a military auction. These ships are the bottom-of-the-barrel.
Oh, and those "hidden gems" you hear about ﬁnding
buried at the bottom of the barrel? Sure, anything's possible,
but realize that most ships as these lots have been picked
over by its dealer. Most of the time, the ship won't really
be worth the little money you buy it for.
But, hey, it's your ticket to the stars.
> Advantage Flaw: Some system of the ship is unreliable,
and may break down entirely. This may also be used with the
optional Advantages system (see pages 50–51).
> Age: At one rank, this Disadvantage is handled through
roleplaying like its character counterpart; people view the ship
as being too old or too unproven to get the job done. At two
ranks, an old ship will have its difficulties increased by +1 for any
action that pushes its systems beyond bare functionality, while
a young ship has all repair and upgrade difficulties increased by
+1 due to the unavailability of new parts.

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 3
Notes: "This ship isn't curs--". . .

> Bad Luck: The ship is cursed. Any roll that fulﬁlls the Bad
Luck condition while directly utilizing the ship will be affected.
(Thus a piloting roll can suffer its affects, while a melee combat in
the gym cannot.) Obviously, this Disadvantage is cinematic.
> Burn-out: This can apply to various ship systems.
> Cultural Unfamiliarity and Employed: These Disadvantages are generally unsuitable for ships.
> Debt: This is one of the rare Disadvantages that would
be incurred by the ship's owner; the person borrowed money
to pay for part of the ship. Failure to fulﬁll the Debt condition
will result in the ship being repossessed.
> Devotion: This could apply to a ship with a stubborn AI,
or a bio-organic ship with its own urges and goals.
> Enemy: The ship may have been stolen, or belong to an
unpopular race. Regardless, some person (or people) will harass or
attack the ship on sight. Efforts to dissuade the attackers will fail
until the Enemy is dealt with (and the Disadvantage paid off ).
> Hindrance: Hindrance cannot affect any skill that has a
bonus provided by the vessel. Thus a ship that provides +1D
to piloting cannot have a Hindrance that penalizes piloting. In
addition, any skills so hindered must have a reasonable chance
at being used (or useful) to the ship. Move penalties cannot be
taken in lieu of the skill penalties.
> Infamy: Perhaps the ship was formerly a pirate vessel or
responsible for notorious deaths. Regardless, it will be treated
poorly by other ship captains and authorities.
> Language Problems: The vessel's controls and programming languages are wildly atypical, and no amount of tinkering
will make it compatible.
> Prejudice: This is akin to Infamy, only it refers to a class
of ships that are unpopular in this neck of the galaxy.
> Price: Some aspect of the ship requires something unusual
to power or maintain it. For example, the interstellar drive may
require rare crystals to operate.
> Quirk: The ship has some signiﬁcant quirks that require either living with or considerable effort to work
around. For example, the ship might
not dock easily (requiring a shuttlecraft to get to and from other ships),
or the targeting computer may have a
difficult time shutting off (continuing to
ﬁre even after the battle has ended). At
acquisition, this Disadvantage is tied to
a skill required to overcome it -- usually
piloting or vehicle repair.
> Reduced Attribute: This will
only apply to Maneuvering or Hull
Toughness, and only if the affected
attribute hasn't been improved
(either through thrusters, armor,
or shields).
How this system is used is up to
the gamemaster. If a number of ships
are available, a failed but close Funds roll
may have the difference made up in Dis-

advantages; the ship seller has a ship similar to the original one
offered, only not quite as good. Alternatively, the Disadvantages
may be unknown to the buyer (or mostly unknown, if Debt is
taken). This can represent the haggling between the buyer and
the seller, with the seller coming down in price because she
knows the ship has problems she didn't disclose.

Damage and Disadvantages
As another separate option to introduce Disadvantages into
ships, a Critical Failure on a failed armor repair, ﬂight systems
repair, or gunnery repair roll for a ship with Severe damage may
introduce one or more ranks of Disadvantages -- usually Quirks,
Achilles' Heels, or Hindrances. In this case, such Disadvantages
can exceed the limits of this chapter, at the gamemaster's discretion. For example, Hindrance might represent a reduction in the
ship's Space Move or Interstellar Speed, or Reduced Attribute
might affect the Hull Toughness of a ship with shields.

Paying off Disadvantages
While taking a Disadvantage may make it possible to afford
a ship in the ﬁrst place, getting rid of those ﬂaws can be nearly
impossible. Really, it's usually easier to melt the ship down into
molten ore and recast it into a new, less-ﬂawed form. But it's
not impossible.
There are two different possibilities for getting rid of a ship's
Disadvantages. The ﬁrst is to pay money for its removal. If using
the Funds system, getting rid of one level of a Disadvantage has
a price difficulty equal to the current cost of the vehicle. Thus
the scout ship with a difficulty of 41 (45 minus four ranks of
Disadvantages) would require a Funds roll of 41 to remove one
of those four levels. After so doing, a future roll of 42 would be
required to remove another level. In the case of a Disadvantage
that doesn't have a lower rank version (such as an R3 Achilles'

before it goes away; each level would need to be paid for with a

costs 50,000 credits to remove.
The second way is to spend Character Points to remove the
Disadvantage. The players' characters may pay 50 times the
die code of the Disadvantage. They may pool their Character
Points to do so. All the other rules concerning the removal of
Disadvantages from p. 53 of the D6 Space Rulebook still apply.
Note that either of these two rules apply to Debt, even though
that Disadvantage is technically taken by the buyer.

Advantages and
Special Abilities

The Disadvantages system simulates ships with quirks and
other oddities. A similar system can also be used to emulate
ships that can do more than the average vessel.
Although uncommon, some ships may -- with gamemaster
approval -- have abilities that are not otherwise accounted for
in the rules. These are represented by levels of Advantages or
Special Abilities. For each rank given, add 1 to the ﬁnal price
difficulty of a vessel, or 10,000 credits. All such options must
be approved by the gamemaster, who should consider the
implications carefully.
Most Advantages and Special Abilities are inappropriate for
space ships, although of course creative shipbuilders can ﬁnd
odd uses for these options. Special Abilities in ships are usually
uncommon, and they may get ranks of Disadvantage added at
no additional modiﬁer.
Some of the most appropriate Advantages are:
> Authority: This represents a vessel that obviously holds
sway over some aspect of space merely by its presence. For
example, a ship may be a galactic police vessel, a ﬂagship for

a space-faring empire, or an interstellar humanitarian aid
ship. Regardless, other ships will give the vessel access or wide
lanes to do its duty. Note that the captains (and often other
crewpersons) of such ships either have appropriate levels of
Authority themselves, or they -- and quite likely their ship
-- have levels of Enemy (if the captains are using such ships
without permission).
> Contacts or Patron: It is unlikely for a spaceship to"know"
anyone itself, although it might be possible if the ship has a
sophisticated AI or is a bio-organic construct.
> Equipment: This Advantage is good to represent some odd
piece of equipment that can't be simulated any other way.
> Fame: The ship will be treated better than normal. Of
course, great things are often expected of the famous.
Under no circumstances should a ship have the Size Advantage. Instead, ships should buy up their size normally (or be made
smaller), if so desired. Wealth and Trademark Specialization are
likewise impossible, although a ship could simulate the renowned
aspect of Trademark Specialization with Fame.
It's impossible to detail all the Special Abilities that a ship
might have, although some of the more common possibilities
are as follows.
> Atmospheric Tolerance or Water Breathing: These
can be bought by a ship that's already atmosphere-capable to
make it compatible with additional or extreme environment
-- usually water.
> Blur, Darkness, Invisibility, and Master of Disguise:
These are all useful for ships with stealth or other unusual
abilities that thwart their detection.
> Extra Sense and Infravision/Ultravision: These abilities give the ship the ability to sense some form of energy or
phenomenon that is usually impossible for vessels to detect. For
example, a shuttlecraft might be able to detect wormholes. What
things are detectable or undetectable should be established by
the gamemaster beforehand.
> Fast Reactions: For whatever
reason, the ship is fast. Unless the
ship is autonomous (via an AI or
bio-organic nature), the pilot chooses
when to activate the extra actions. In
addition, the pilot receives the +1D
per rank bonus to his Perception when
determining initiative.
> Fear: Because of size, armament,
or other aura, the ship is scarier than
normal.
> Hypermovement: This Special
Ability can only be used to increase the
in-planet movement of an atmospheric capable vessel, as per the
chart on page 43.
> Immortality: It is actually
possible for a ship to be immortal.
Perhaps it is destined to survive no
matter what (such as a "ghost ship"), or
perhaps it is a bio-organic vessel that does

not die as the average mortal understands
it. Any damage is still passed on to the passengers, as per normal; the crew can all die,
even if the ship cannot.
> Intangibility: Some ships are
rumored to be able to use the spacetime warping capabilities of their
interstellar drive in-system, enabling
them to "phase out" of the universe for
short periods of time.
> Luck: While some ships are cursed,
others seem to be made out of horseshoes and
clover. Such ships often have Fame as well.
> Omnivorous: This Special Ability is
usually inappropriate for most campaigns
that don't make an issue about refueling.
However, in campaigns that have more
stringent fuel requirements, Omnivorous
can represent a ship that has many other
refueling options: ram scoops, alternate
processing units, and so on. In this case, the
vessel will still require an amount of fuel (as
determined by the gamemaster), but the ship
will have more options as to where it gets that fuel from.
> Teleportation: This ability enables the ship to breach the
normal space-time continuum, and in so doing move up to 10
space units per rank instantly. The ability can only be used to
teleport this number of units maximum per day; thus a ship with
two ranks of this Special Ability could make one 20-space-unit
jump, four ﬁve-space-unit jumps, or 20 one-space-unit jumps.
Otherwise the rules are the same as the Special Ability of the
same name.
> Ventriloquism: The ship can generate some kind of sensory ability that can fool other ships, up to three space units
away per rank.
Any abilities that add to an attribute or skill are generally
unavailable, since those abilities can be purchased through
computer or system upgrades. However, it's possible that
some of these might represent abilities unavailable through
other means. In this case, the cost per level should generally be
greater than the cost of similar enhancements; if the 10,000credit cost is not sufficient, the gamemaster can adjust this as
necessary. These include Accelerated Healing, Ambidextrous,
Armor-Defeating Attack, Attack Resistance, Confusion, Endurance, Enhanced Sense, Environmental Resistance, Hardiness,
Immunity, Increased Attribute, Life Drain, Multiple Abilities,
Natural Armor, Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon, Natural
Ranged Weapon, Paralyzing Touch, Sense of Direction, Skill
Bonus, Skill Minimum, and Uncanny Aptitude.
Other abilities are reliant on a humanoid, organic, or spiritual
body to make sense. Although it's feasible a ship might use them,
they would be incredibly rare. These include Animal Control,
Elasticity, Glider Wings, Longevity, Possession (Limited or
Full), Quick Study, Shapeshifting, Silence, Transmutation, and
Youthful Appearance.

Damage, Advantages, and
Special Abilities
For those games using the"Damage and Disadvantages" option
from earlier in this chapter, the gamemaster may opt -- instead of
adding Disadvantages -- to instead remove Advantages or Special
Abilities as the result of a Critical Failure on a failure.

Buying Advantages
There are three different possibilities for adding Advantages
to ships. The ﬁrst is to pay money for its addition. If using the
Funds system, adding one rank of an Advantage has a price difficulty equal to the current cost of the vehicle. Thus the scout
ship with a difficulty of 45 would require a Funds roll of 45 to
add one rank of an Advantage or one point of a Special Ability.
After so doing, a future roll of 46 would be required to add
another rank or point. In the case of an Advantage or Special
Ability that costs more than one point (such as Silence), all the
ranks or points of the Advantage need to be bought before it
is added; each level would need to be paid for with a separate
roll. In games using credits, each rank of Advantage or point of
Special Ability costs 50,000 credits to add.
The second way is to spend Character Points to add the
Advantage or Special Ability. The players' characters may pay
25 times the die code of the Advantage or Special Ability. They
may pool their Character Points to do so. All the other rules
concerning the addition of Advantages or Special Abilities from
pages 53–54 of the D6 Space Rulebook still apply.
The third way to add an Advantage or Special Ability is to
add one more rank of Disadvantages than the new option added.
Thus to add a rank 2 Authority a ship might acquire a rank 3
Enemy; a ship that was christened and repainted as a galactic
police vessel now has to deal with the scum of the universe.

What's in this Chapter

This chapter offers a sampling of popular ships built with
on of the three different systems suggested in the ship design
chapter. Suggested images are included, but actual conﬁgurations
depend on the speciﬁcs of the setting.

Key to Descriptions

In these descriptions, "areas" refers to area units, "eu" stands
for "energy units," and "cr" means "credits."
For general information about various modules in each ship,
consult the "Revised Ship Design" chapter.

Four-Factor Ships
Drop Ship

Drop ships are gunboats designed to transport troops to other
vessels and planetary surfaces more efficiently than outﬁtting a
cruiser for atmospheric duty. More heavily armed versions are
often used as patrol craft. Because of their short-distance service,
they generally don't get interstellar drives.
The ﬁrst ship is outﬁtted for a squadron, while the second
provides a means of getting a ground assault vehicle and its
crew onto a planet.

In one form or another, nearly every high-tech worlds
have these small vessels darting about their planets or
battleships. Light defenders are commonly carried on battlecruisers and used for the protection of those vessels.
The Wasp class of light defenders, though admired for
its quickness and maneuverability, has been dubbed "ﬂash and
burn" by their pilots, due to their tendency to explode after
taking only a few hits.

Light Freighter
The workhorse of the mercantile industry, light freighters make short runs between established and colony worlds.
Unfortunately, it's also popular prey for pirate assaults more
often than megacorporate executives care to admit.
The primary feature of a freighter is its bays, capable of carrying bulk equipment, fragile wares, and so on. This versatility
allows independent freighter captains to ﬁnd work with virtually
any megacorporation.
This is also the most common template for other small-tomid-range vessels: Add some nice paint and luxury upgrades to
the interior and a ﬂashy name, and this sample ship serves well
as a yacht. Stock the ship with survey equipment and long-term
supplies, and it becomes a large research vessel.

Remote Outpost
The remote outpost can serve as a research station or a
communications relay on an asteroid or moon. Add a small
energy cannon, and it works well as a military defense station.
It's designed to work automatically, having no means of supporting life, though it needs periodic checking for refueling
and maintenance.

Scout Ship
The military depends on scout ships for gathering information and transporting important couriers and some supplies.
Megacorporations and independent adventurers use these ships
for much the same reason. They are designed to be quick and
agile, able to get their crews out of trouble as quickly as they
got into it. Those with interstellar drives and long-term supplies
can patrol the wastes of space for years.

Strike Fighter
These ships represent two different versions of a hard-hitting

The carrier is a huge military vessel used to ferry sublight
ﬁghters via interstellar travel and to launch them into combat.
The carrier's ﬂight compliment includes six squadrons of six
ﬁghters each. The carrier usually also holds four shuttlecraft
for administrative duties or ship-to-shore travel (as carriers are
too huge to operate within the atmosphere of a planet). Most
carriers are not as heavily armed as their massive size would
imply, instead devoting more space to hangar and launch facilities and entrusting their defense to the ﬁghters they carry, as
well as to the escort vessels that usually accompany the carrier
in ﬂeet operations.

Pirate Corsair
Pirate vessels come in all shapes and sizes. This example is
fairly typical, being a reﬁtted cargo vessel with much of the portage space being used for additional weapons and shields. Many
of the components come from several black-market sources,
making the typical pirate ship look like a ragtag collection of
parts welded together.

Freeform Design System

The game characteristics for these vessels are reduced from
that required by the full design system. As these vessels are more
gamemaster's characters than something the players control,
that works ﬁne. Plus, they give examples of ships made with
the freeform method.

Ship Weaknesses _
Many ships, especially those bought (or stolen) used
or large ones designed with the freeform method, have
ﬂaws. Damaging the power plant may cause the weapons
to overload and explode. One vital part might not be as
heavily armored as the rest of the ship. Concentrating
ﬁre on a seemingly meaningless opening may trigger the
self-destruct sequence. Or the gamemaster might come up
with another weakness.
Once the gamemaster decides what it is, he should
set the difficulty to ﬁgure it out; the difficulty to hit it
(including the scale value), if it's outside the ship; and the
amount of damage that needs to be done to it to cause the
ship's destruction.

An interstellar cruise ship and transport vessel, the Galaxy's
Wings offers a means of getting around the universe without
purchasing an entire ship. The vessel is one of many in its
corporation's ﬂeet. It offers numerous amenities, such as exercise

has a strict schedule and visits only the most popular planets.
This is partly for safety (it has minimal armaments and thus
sticks to patrolled space) and partly for economic reasons.

What's in this Chapter

Space is a realm of literally inﬁnite dimensions, with limitless
potential for variety in encounters. Elements from any genre can
be incorporated into a space-based campaign with only a little
work. Characters traveling the galaxy in their own starship can
be explorers, scholars, warriors, criminals, law enforcers, or any
other of a hundred different roles that have been portrayed in
ﬁlm, ﬁction, and adventure gaming for decades.
This chapter offers a toolkit for gamemasters to create
adventures revolving around the possession of and operation of
a starship, the ultimate piece of equipment for characters in an
interstellar campaign. Themes, plots, and encounters, , including
alien encounters, natural phenomenon, navigational hazards,
criminal enterprises, and others, are examined. Players are also
encouraged to look through the chapter, to get background and
goal ideas for their characters and to get ideas about the kinds
of adventures they'd like to experience.

Basic Story Aspects
Theme
The ﬁrst and most important step in creating an encounter for
a space campaign is to determine the theme. Generally speaking,
an encounter's theme should be compatible with the overall theme
of the campaign. Exceptions should be relatively rare in order to
preserve both the cumulative atmosphere that must be gradually
developed in any campaign, as well as the more immediate plans
for the impending encounter. Repeatedly changing the mood
and ambiance of a campaign can diminish the enjoyment for
everyone involved. With that in mind, here are three common
themes and how they interact with one another.
Exploration: Exploration is perhaps the quintessential
theme of the space genre. A lone starship, traveling into deep
space, encountering places, creatures, and phenomenon no other
being has yet discovered is the perfect representation of a space
campaign. There is literally no limit to the types of encounters
such a campaign can contain, given its inherently varied nature.
It's simple to introduce encounters of other themes into such a
campaign, as conﬂict is a universal truth that can be encountered
in the uncharted wilds of space just as easily as in the galaxy's
politic-ridden heart. Conﬂict should be used cautiously, however,
as such encounters can damage the sense of wonder and discovery
that are the linchpins of an exploration campaign. Independence

Notes: Indie explorers start galactic war.

as a theme goes hand in hand with exploration, for few explorers
are not self-reliant, freedom-loving wanderers at heart.
Conﬂict: A theme of conﬂict can take any number of forms
ranging from the dark and sinister experiences of blood-thirsty
pirates to that of a just, noble cause being carried out by loyal,
valiant warriors. Starships make excellent resources for such
encounters, as they can be tailored to suit the needs of ﬁghters
perfectly, employing defense, offense, and mobility in whatever
capacity is required. Exploration-themed adventures can be at
odds with a conﬂict-based campaign, although they can serve to
instill a sense of wonder in an otherwise bleak campaign, allowing
jaded warriors to reconsider their chosen lifestyle or reminding
noble soldiers of the reason for their righteous campaign.
Independence: The theme of independence is an integral
part of many common spacer archetypes. Smugglers, privateers,
free traders, and even law enforcement personnel traverse the
galaxy in search of true independence. The starship is the ideal
vessel for such character, permitting them to go anywhere for
any reason. Encounters with exploration themes work well in an
independence campaign, allowing characters to enjoy the fruits
of their self-reliance. Conﬂict as a theme should be used less
frequently, unless as a struggle for the characters to maintain their
independence. Occasional forays into an interplanetary war during the course of an adventure can demonstrate to the characters
exactly why they have chosen the lifestyle they embrace.

With a theme selected, the gamemaster now determines the
plot of the adventure. In the 1920s, an author named Georges
Polti published a book entitled The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations, in which he theorized that every story could be grouped
into one of a number of possible plots. Not all of these plots
are of use in a space encounter, obviously, but there are several
that can be broadly incorporated into an appropriate encounter.
Each plot in this list of examples includes the broad category
followed by a list of the major participants or factors and then
an explanation of the plot.

69

Supplication (factors: persecutor, suppliant, a power in
authority): A supplication is a request for aid made by someone
suffering persecution. Genre favorites along this line include
the request to an old general to come out of retirement to aid a
persecuted group under the heel of some petty tyrant, the hiring
of freelance starship crews by the citizens of some backwater
planet to protect them from a pirate ﬂeet, or the request of a

dying stranger to deliver a package of some sort to a distant
world or individual.

Creating Atmosphere _

Daring Enterprise (factors: bold leader, goal, adversary): A daring enterprise can describe almost any act or mission undertaken
by a starship crew. Rescuing a prisoner from a distant asteroid
prison encampment, delivering a cargo through an impenetrable
blockade, or hunting a lost artifact through the drifting ruins of a
destroyed planet all fall into this category. In any such enterprise,
the crew's skill and bravado take center stage, but the starship
provides the tools with which to complete the task.

As with so many elements of a successful space campaign,
careful planning and a bit of creative thinking can work
wonders in creating the proper atmosphere and enhancing
the gaming experience for everyone.

Erroneous Judgment (factors: mistaken one, victim of mistake,
author of mistake, guilty person): Any character can be accused of
acts he hasn't committed, and it's a simple matter to incorporate
an existing nemesis of some sort as the author of this mistake.
Perhaps the crew's vessel has been identiﬁed as containing illegal
cargo, or perhaps it has been targeted by law enforcement as having
been used in the commission of a crime. In either case, the ship
becomes the focus for an unpleasant conﬂict that can be resolved
in a wide number of ways depending on the inclinations of the
crew and their hopes for the campaign's future.
Loss of Loved Ones (factors: person slain, witness, executioner): This plot is easy to incorporate into a starship-based
campaign: use the destruction of the crew's ship to spiral them
into a completely unexpected encounter with existing enemies,
new enemies, or a third party responsible for the destruction
(perhaps completely by mistake).

Types of Encounters

Once the gamemaster, with input from the players, selects
the theme and plot, it's time to ﬂesh it out into an adventure.
This section examines several broad types of encounters that
an adventure could contain. In each case, options for using that
particular type of encounter are discussed, and short encounter
ideas are provided in each section. These ideas are intended as
simple capsules to spark the imagination and provide material
for developing stellar adventures.

Alien Encounters
The notion of an encounter with aliens is probably them
most tantalizing possibility for players and gamemasters alike
when participating in a space-based campaign. It's the deﬁning
element of the genre, the quintessential experience for every
player who dreams of ﬂying among the stars in a craft capable
of faster than light travel. Though there are of course exceptions,
it's safe to say that most space-based campaigns will experience
an alien encounter at some point during their tenure.
By deﬁnition, an alien encounter involves something unfamiliar or unknown to the characters involved. While this can
take many forms, new beings (possibly intelligent and wielding incredible and fantastic technology) are the most typical
manifestation. There have been countless works of ﬁction based
around this simple premise, and it's an easy concept to use as
an adventure idea for any space-based game. Other variations
on this idea include encounters with some sort of artifact left
behind by an alien race, or with events set into motion through
the action or lack thereof by aliens and their civilization.

Music: Music is the most accessible and possibly the
most effective means of establishing a proper atmosphere.
There are a number of motion picture soundtracks available
that are practically icons of the genre, and they can evince
particularly speciﬁc images and emotions. Some preparation prior to the encounter can let the gamemaster queue
up certain pieces of music for certain scenes.
Movies: Watching a portion of a movie or series that
involves similar events to an encounter can inspire players, but can also bring about accusations of unoriginality
if overused. Generally, this technique works best by using
only portions of a movie that contain no dialogue or recognizable characters, but focus instead on background,
setting, or just a little bit of "eye candy."
Maps: For situations occurring within a starship's interior, a map can be invaluable in speeding up any combat
encounters and answering players' questions about where
rooms are located. For intense, suspenseful combat scenes
wherein the characters are searching for an unknown foe,
gamemasters may consider covering portions of the map
that the characters don't know about, adding an element
of mystery to the affair.
Likewise, a map can simplify matters for ship-to-ship
combat. A simple two-dimensional map can offer a basic
idea of where each vessel is in relation to others. Using
stands of variable heights can improve the experience by
simulating the three-dimensional nature of space.
Food: Although not as effective as other genres, it still
may be possible to set the mood for a space encounter with
food. Various freeze-dried foods are commercially available, and they are an excellent representation of the type of
rations some crews might have to make do on for weeks or
even months at a time between planetary visits.

Alien Life Forms
Alien life forms are the most intriguing form of encounter, perhaps because of our own inherent fascination with those things
that are new and different from our existing body of knowledge.
An intelligent foe is the most bracing challenge a character can
face, and introducing one whose mannerisms, motivations, and
abilities are completely unknown only complicates the matter
further. Likewise, making an ally out of an unknown quantity is
an achievement that can distinguish a character from the pack,
giving them a unique resource to draw upon.

Alien Starships
The simplest means of encountering alien life forms while
traveling through space is to meet them in ships of their own.
Communication is the ﬁrst and most pressing obstacle characters

must overcome when interacting with a new race. The technology
necessary for interstellar travel is truly impressive, but it does
not mean a ﬂawless communication between different species.
Depending on the setting, computers capable of interpreting and
translating thousands or even millions of different languages
can and do exist, but many are too large or too expensive to be
found on the average privately owned starship. In other games,
understanding other species may be commonplace.
Once communication has been achieved, things may or may
not progress smoothly.
The encounter could be resolved peaceably and diplomatically, establishing ﬁrst contact between whatever group
the characters represent and the new alien civilization. It also
could serve as comic relief as a group of seasoned deep-spacers
attempt to play the diplomats to a noble entity whose customs
are an utter mystery.
It's equally simple for a ﬁrst-contact encounter to rapidly
turn to violence. Perhaps the characters' ship inadvertently
strays into a high-security region of some alien military
organization, or into a system that's hotly contested by two
separate alien races. In either case, the aliens will respond
quickly to the appearance of any unknown ship (such as that
possessed by the characters) with violence -- and a warning
ﬁrst, if the characters are lucky. Even if the characters can
comprehending alien languages, the best they can hope for is
to be quickly boarded and interrogated. This could lead to any
number of interesting scenarios, perhaps even one wherein
the characters must escape from an alien prison ship.
Alien starships can be incorporated into encounters that
do not involve direct interaction. The characters may become
aware that such a ship is in the area but be unable to locate
it for whatever reason, perhaps because it has more advanced
technology. This can have an effect on whatever other activities are taking place with regard to the characters' mission. If
the party is in the system on a survey mission, for example,
the alien vessel's cloaking ﬁeld could be dramatically altering
the results of their scans or even their navigational systems,
making it difficult or impossible to complete the mission
or leave the area until the matter is resolved.
Another potential encounter type, one that involves
the characters' ship tangentially, is a reversal of a common
theme in science ﬁction ﬁlm and stories: reconnaissance
and experimentation. As a military or scientiﬁc endeavor,
the characters and their vessel could be hired, forced, or
conscripted to make early contact with an alien civilization

via espionage or abduction. This would allow the players to
experience the opposite side of a traditional genre convention
and raise interesting ethical questions for the characters to deal
with in the process.
Another interesting encounter with aliens might be with
primitive beings that have been taken into space against their
will, usually as slaves. Characters who defeat an attacking vessel
or who track down slavers for some reason (perhaps they are
law enforcement officials) could encounter such primitive beings
who might regard the characters as saviors, perpetrators, or even
deities. The characters could be saddled with these unwanted
passengers until such time as they could ﬁnd somewhere else
for them to go or locate their home planet, a difficult prospect
at best unless they've found a means of communicating with
the former slaves.

Space-Dwelling Organisms
Perhaps the most alien form of life that can be imagined is
that which exists in the cold, airless vacuum of space. Such beings
are often more similar to the metals and plastics that make up
a ship's substance than that of the crew piloting it. Obviously,
this type of life form is exceedingly rare, as space is the most
inhospitable environment known to exist. The pressureless
vacuum, the unﬁltered solar radiation, and the constant peril of
impact from countless drifting items of debris does not create
an environment conducive to evolution. Nevertheless, under the
rarest of circumstances, that's exactly what occurs.

Space-borne organisms are typically primitive creatures operating on instinct and little else. Survival is all that can be expected in
space; the development of language or culture is nearly impossible.
In most cases, these organisms are similar to those that might
develop deep in the ocean, or to microscopic organisms.
Characters intent on investigating the mining possibilities in
a vast asteroid belt might ﬁnd their plans altered considerably
if they discover that same belt is the spawning ground of a vast
herd of titanic space creatures similar to drifting jellyﬁsh. And
what if the characters' favorite shipping route becomes infested
with millions of strange, ﬁsh-like creatures intent on feeding
on the energy particles left in the wake of starships exactly like
those the characters pilot?
Space-borne life forms should be used sparingly in a campaign unless they are its focus. The sense of wonder that such
organisms create can easily be lost if overused, diminishing the
appeal of the concept in the ﬁrst place. The key element of any
encounter involving them is to maintain an alien atmosphere.
Beings such as these should remain mysterious, foreign, and
ultimately unknowable to the characters.

Parasites and Inﬁltrators
There is no more insidious threat than that which threatens
the characters' starship. The ship is more than just the party's
home; it's the source of everything that sustains them during
their travels. If the ship is damaged, disabled, or inﬁltrated,
their life is in serious jeopardy from asphyxiation, starvation,
or a violent, unexpected death.
In space, a starship is the only immediate source of electrical
energy. Electricity is a basic form of energy that many creatures,
particularly those born in the depths of space, can metabolize
and use to survive. Creatures like these might view a passing
starship as little more than a traveling restaurant, and they
attack it like any predator would their prey. With the power
cells drained, the ship would become a tomb for its crew, and
the satiated creatures would continue on their way until the next
meal became available. Many ships carry a shielded, secondary
power cell to be used in the event of emergencies like this, but
installing them can prove a lengthy and complicated process,
adding another element of tension to such an encounter.
The slow dread a character can feel at the prospect of a lonely
death from starvation or suffocation can create tremendous
atmosphere for an encounter, but even more can be generated
with another basic sensation: fear of being hunted. Introducing
a creature onto a starship that the crew cannot identify but that's
clearly both hostile and dangerous, can create an environment
rife with potential for roleplaying. Countless ﬁlms have captured

this sense of panic and paranoia and can provide inspiration for
reproducing it during an encounter.

Alien Artifacts
There may be nothing more strange and mysterious than
discovering a relic of an ancient alien race that has endured
for ages. With objects constantly drifting through the literally
inﬁnite span between planets, stars, systems, and galaxies, it's
possible for space-bound artifacts to be discovered millions of
light-years away from their point of origin, leaving those who
discover them with absolutely no means of learning about their
true origins or purpose. This can be a frustrating experience,
or it can be quite fulﬁlling if it's tailored to the interests and
strengths of a well-rounded party.
See also "Artiﬁcial Hazards" later in this chapter for additional ideas.

Drifting Artifacts
A mysterious object is discovered ﬂoating in space -- the
very thought can stir the imaginations of many players. There
is an almost limitless variety of such objects that can be introduced, allowing gamemasters to create as grand or as personal
an experience for the characters as they choose.
Drifting artifacts need to be of at least comparable size to a
starship, else they might never be noticed in the vast nothingness
between planets. Manageable enigmas would necessarily be of
a size that the characters can control. An alien vessel or space
station adrift in space is something that an average party can take
advantage of, either salvaging what they can from it or taking the
ship to use as their own, assuming it's in condition to do so. An
encounter like this can propel the characters into the spotlight
as they use a previously unknown technology to make a name
for themselves in their profession of choice. This can also lead to
further encounters, as this technology will doubtless be coveted
by rivals, criminals, and government officials alike.
Larger scale artifacts include space stations the size of planets
or moons, giant rings that encircle entire planets, and colossal
spheres built around a star to harness its energy. The existence
of such an artifact could form the basis for an adventure or even
an entire campaign. In the case of a sphere, a party of adventurers stranded on an artifact of that size could explore it for years,
decades, or centuries and only discover a fraction of its surface.
Likewise, characters could create a headquarters or temporary
base from large-scale enigmas. (If they do this before they explore
the neighborhood, they might be in for unpleasant surprises
when they return from their forays into space.)
Taking a mundane object and adding even a single unique
feature can dramatically alter the way that the characters perceive
it. For example, a starship might be constructed from organic
material rather than metal and plastic, or a space station could
possess systems operated entirely through song.
Personal Artifacts
Out-of-the-ordinary artifacts of a more personal scale can
be introduced into a campaign through any number of means,
although salvaging them from a derelict ship can add another
element of mystery to the adventure. Is the alien artifact the

driving force behind the not-soalien ship's derelict status? Or was
the ship destroyed because of the
artifact, rather than by the artifact directly?
The effects of smaller
scale artifacts can vary considerably. Players may not
consider the notion of scale.
An artifact the size of a normal laser riﬂe could actually be
a vehicle for a race of beings far
smaller than the norm -- a single
piece of nanotechnology from a race
of beings larger than the average
Human could comprehend.
Personal artifacts with an
unknown function but immediately identiﬁable, seemingly beneﬁcial effect can quickly become
a fixture for characters who
discover them. Allowing them
to make use of them for lengthy
periods of time before revealing
their somewhat questionable (or
in some cases downright sinister) origins or uses is an excellent
way to ensure the characters have a personal investment in the
adventure's outcome. A character that discovers her revolutionary
new suit of alien body armor is actually an advanced sarcophagus
designed to perfectly preserve a corpse placed within it might
think twice about how she interacts with other unknown
quantities in the future. If the sarcophagus seals after becoming
attuned to its wearer, it could be a harrowing few days before
her friends ﬁgure out how to get her out of it.

Remnants
Leftovers from an alien civilization do not need to be mysterious to have an impact. There are large number of possible
encounters that are mundane but that have more than enough
intrigue to capture the interest of a starship's crew. An abandoned
mining facility built into an asteroid amid a belt is interesting,
but if the characters' scans reveal absolutely nothing of any interest worth mining throughout the entire belt, curiosities might
be piqued. No mining operation is so efficient as to remove a
resource from a belt entirely, so the nature of whatever was being
mined becomes a particularly valuable puzzle.
Another alien remnant that has served as a source for several
popular ﬁctions is that of bacteria or other microscopic organisms. Infection can be a terrifying foe, as there are no visible
weapons that can be turned against it, and few starship crews have
the skills necessary to combat a menace of this nature. Exposing
a crew to an unknown but debilitating illness can send them into
a frantic whirlwind of activity as they seek a means, any means,
of combating the illness. Introducing such a threat can serve as
a seemingly harmless beginning to an encounter that will end
with a desperate race against time to save the lives of an entire
crew while managing to avoid infecting anyone else. Perhaps

the crew becomes tainted when exploring the drifting hulk of
an ancient alien starship, or when delving into a forgotten ruin
in deep inside a backwater planet. Regardless of the means of
introduction, such a threat can become life-threatening almost
immediately, or it may linger for a long period of time before
ﬁnally coming to a point, allowing for a series of encounters
based around the threat's manifestation.
Remnants of an alien civilization can be very simple in nature.
The enigma comes from their abandonment. An alien starship
found ﬂoating abandoned in space, with no sign of any damage
and all systems fully operations, is a mystery itself, even if the
technology used in the ship's construction is relatively mundane.
An asteroid-mining facility becomes even more intriguing if
it were somewhat primitive in nature, begging the question
of how a race with such limited technology could create and
oversee an asteroid-mining operation, much less what strange
quantity they sought there.

Alien Legacies

74

Just as every planet has ancient civilizations that no longer
exist, the galaxy is full of lost secrets every bit as engaging and
involved as the artifacts described in the previous, but less
tangible. These secrets can be extraordinarily valuable to the
right parties, and a starship crew can make a ﬁne living pursuing
remnants of a lost age as their primary occupation. Governments, 
educational facilities, scholars and wealthy collectors all
hire freelancers to assist in the reclamation of data lost to the
eons. Although involving alien life only indirectly, these types
of adventures can offer a substantial ﬁnancial reward that can
motivate even the most conservative spacer.
Alien legacy encounters depend heavily on a sense of the
mysterious and the interaction with others. Fellow scholars,

Subdirectory > Deep Space Exploration _
As crewmembers aboard a deep space survey vessel, the
heroes travel into unexplored territory, charting new worlds,
safe jump routes, and astrographic hazards. They must make
ﬁrst contact with previously undiscovered alien species, analyze worlds for important resources, decipher the mysteries
surrounding ancient artifacts, and continue delving into the
farthest, darkest reaches of space with little or no support.
The characters might have an agenda they must fulﬁll in a
speciﬁed time: ﬁnd a colony world for a dying planet, discover
components to cure a devastating plague, or establish contact
with new allies to aid against enemies back home.

Adversaries and Allies _
Exploring the unknown often pits the characters against
a variety of challenges, each one quite different as the ship
jumps from one system to the next. Recurring adversaries,
however, help shape a consistent campaign, so gamemasters
should develop some foe to regularly harass the heroes. Perhaps an alien empire is currently invading (or already rules)
this region of space and enforces a strict prohibition against
outsiders. Local warlords might try extending their inﬂuence
against nearby worlds, especially with the characters' willing
or unwilling assistance. A rival group of corporate- or government-sponsored explorers might seek to get rid of the heroes
and exploit the area for their own interests. A sun nearing
the supernova stage might threaten the entire region and all
its inhabitants.
Since they're far from their home territory, the characters
have few allies. Gamemasters might help the heroes along
with occasional remote supply pods jettisoned in their direction, or maybe a small depot on the edge of known space
they can use in emergencies. The deeper they go, however,
the more self-sufficient the crew must become. In the course
of their explorations, they might make allies who can offer
them food, fuel, and repair facilities, so diplomacy is vital to
their success.

73

Starships _

74

Since an exploration campaign centers on the survey craft,
gamemasters should work with players to design a vessel that
suits their needs. Do the heroes want a small ship where each
character plays a vital role, or would they prefer to serve as
the command crew aboard a capital ship? Venturing into
the unknown requires the craft to possess adequate shields
and weapons to deal with threats, plus specialized equipment to understand and analyze new ﬁndings: powerful
sensor arrays, research computers, ground instruments and
vehicles, science labs, probes, landing shuttles, and storage
bays for samples.
The ship should have adequate facilities to maintain the
crew for extended periods away from home, including living
quarters, recreation facilities, gardens and hydroponics works,
supply bays, and repair facilities. Deck plans can help determine
what's onboard and what capabilities the ship possesses.

Support Locations _

Each scenario in an exploration campaign brings the heroes
to some new world or astrographical feature. Unless characters
establish some safe haven, few locations exist that can reliably
support their starship.
A gamemaster's greatest challenge is creating different
adventure settings. Each new planet encountered should have
a different ﬂavor: the ocean world; the planet with a primitive, ancient civilization; the collapsing star with a core of rare
and valuable metal; the world whose inhabitants suddenly
died before the heroes arrived; the moon-sized derelict alien
spaceship drifting on a collision course with a planet whose
people are just attaining orbital ﬂight.

Adventure Hooks _
First Contact: The heroes encounter a strange alien species
(either planetside or in their own starship) and must establish
peaceful relations. The aliens have their own agenda -- ﬁnd a
colony world, recruit new allies, trade for valuable commodities,
eliminate all intruders -- and the characters must somehow
comprehend this and, in most cases, help them attain it to
gain their trust and future friendship.
Haunted Planet: While exploring a seemingly uninhabited
planet, the characters discover a long-abandoned ruin from
some arcane civilization. Although they know the world has
no intelligent life, crewmembers suddenly get impressions that
someone's following, even hunting them. The life forces of the
ancients taunt them subtly, slowly turning them against each
other as they chase shadows. When the heroes bring anything
from the surface onto their ship, this paranoia affects everyone, including the vessels' instruments, sensors, computers,
and weapon systems. The heroes must somehow realize this
danger and exorcise it from their ship back to the ruins where
the spirits originally resided.
Evacuation: Just as they conclude extensive studies of a
primate society, the heroes learn of advancing enemies or an
imminent supernova that threatens the simple civilization's
existence. With no means of defense or escape of their own, the
people rely on the characters for evacuation. After ﬁtting the
population, their livestock, and their ungainly cultural treasures
on board, the heroes must ﬂee from the imminent threat, then
begin a search for a new world for these people to call home.

rival relic hunters, competing collectors, and many other similar
groups can serve as foils for the characters in these scenes, where
the alien inﬂuence is merely the motivation. Research, investigation, interrogation, and discovery are possible motivations for
such an adventure. These encounters can be similar to incidents
with alien remnants. The distinction is that a legacy adventure
uses alien material as the motivation rather than the focus.
Information is the most potent alien legacy. An espionage
satellite of unknown origin that has spanned across the width of
the entire known galaxy and beyond would be invaluable to any
number of agencies and individuals. The characters might travel
to a dozen worlds and run afoul of innumerable schemes searching
for the mysterious satellite before ever even encountering it, much
less its true contents. Such a scenario could even be the focus
of a series of adventures, with the satellite and the information
it contains only coming into focus near the campaign's end. It's
even possible that, at the conclusion, the information contained
within it's either useless or indecipherable.

Interstellar Hazards
Space is as dangerous and unpredictable as it's vast. In any
campaign, regardless of how advanced it may be, only a tiny
fraction of the void between systems can have been mapped.
Even in well-known and well-traveled systems, there can be areas
light-years in length that have never been extensively explored,
if for no other reason that there are no immediately identiﬁable
resources contained within that make exploration worthwhile.
Planets with no ability to support life and no valuable elements
can be given a cursory evaluation and then passed over for decades
at a time. Asteroid belts are in a constant state of movement and
are dangerous even for the most cautious explorers.
With any campaign where the focus involves the characters
and their starship, familiarity can breed contempt with regard
to the nature of space itself. Players can become complacent
and overlook the dangers their characters face every time they
leave a planet en route to some distant destination far across the
galaxy. In some cases, however, this can work to the advantage
of those creating encounters for such campaigns.

Natural Phenomenon
While there are an abundance of hazards created by intelligent
beings that drift through the galaxy, naturally occurring hazards
are far more common and typically far more dangerous. Chaos

Navigating an Asteroid Field _
Navigating a ﬁeld requires a piloting roll each round at
+20 to the speed difficulty (see the "Spaceship Movement"
difficulties on page 18 of chapter 2). Failure results in a
collision with one large or several small asteroids, inﬂicting
5D damage to the starship plus an additional amount of
damage equal to the number of points by which the piloting
roll was missed. A Critical Failure combined with a failure
may result in the destruction of an essential system. Use the
"Damage Systems" chart on page 25 to select or randomly
determine which one.

is the nature of space, and there is little that mortal beings can
do to inﬂuence the grand scheme of the cosmos. The best that
can be hoped for with regard to these natural dangers is to map
any that are located and attempt to alert others to their location.
Unfortunately, many of them can claim countless lives before
someone survives to reveal their location to the galaxy at large.
Even more unfortunately, there are those who would use the
location of a hidden danger like these to their own advantage,
as a secret weapon of sorts to waylay their enemies and destroy
any who cross them.

Asteroid Field
Asteroid ﬁelds are an extremely common phenomenon, found
in countless star systems throughout the known universe. They
are made when systems ﬁrst form, as planets begin to settle into
orbit around their star. Inevitably, some planets form orbits
that intersect with one another and eventually collide, creating
a disaster of cosmic proportions. From these celestial head-on
collisions, trillions of tons of debris create vast ﬁelds of rocks,
some of which become captured by larger bodies.
Asteroid belts are typically restricted to certain regions of
space, captured as they are by the same gravity that destroyed
their parent planets. This is not to say that they are static,
however, as the gigantic rocks that make up the belt, some the
size of moons themselves, drift through the region. Collisions
happen frequently, and any event that creates a disturbance
within the region, such as a pitched battle between starships,
can send shockwaves throughout the entire belt. It's in this way
that many meteors and comets are ﬁrst created. Obviously, this
completely unpredictable and random nature makes it virtually
impossible for asteroid belts to be consistently navigated successfully. Most interstellar travelers avoid the belts by going above
or below them to prevent any unforeseen drift that could place
obstacles in their path.
An asteroid belt can serve as a rather unorthodox center for
a campaign, particularly if the characters are using their starship
for less than honorable purposes. Because their unstable nature
causes most groups to shun them, they can afford numerous
places to hide. Criminals use asteroids to avoid their pursuers,
and in some cases, they discover relatively stable pockets within
the belts. More than one pirate base has been built into a large
asteroid and protected with heavy shields. Such a locale can create
a sinister atmosphere for an encounter, one ﬁlled with a sense of
peril as smaller asteroids constantly crash into the shields and are
deﬂected or destroyed. The discovery of the base by law enforcement could make for a battle between multiple starships that takes
place in one of the most hazardous locations known.
More legitimate uses of asteroid belts take the form of
respectable businesses. Asteroids are comprised of many different elements, some of which can be extremely valuable. Just
as planets are extensively mined for precious materials, so too
can a planet's corpse be picked over for large deposits of any
number of valuable commodities. It may even be possible for
normal resources to evolve into something different, given their
state of existence in a vacuum and constant exposure to a variety
of different forms of radiation. Such precious elements might
only be found in asteroid belts, making it far more important for

Piloting in a Nebula _
Every round spent within a nebula requires a Difficult
shields roll. Failure results in 4D damage being inﬂicted on
the ship by electrical discharge. Every 15 points inﬂicted in
this manner results in one system on the ship sustaining
heavy damage. Use the "Damaged Systems" chart on page
25 to select or randomly determine which one.
Nebulae also add +1 or more to sensors difficulties

various parties to make use of the belts. Interplanetary corporations could hire freelancers to scout out secure pockets within a
belt, ﬁnd large deposits, or even to scare away rivals.
Although improbable beyond all reckoning, it's possible
that planets destroyed in the creation of an asteroid belt might
already be home to civilizations that leave remnants to be
discovered in the belt's midst. These remains would have be
among the most durable objects in the universe to survive such
a cataclysm, and would be of interest to many parties simply
because of their survival.

Black Holes
Without question the most dangerous of any naturally
occurring phenomenon in the depths of space, a black hole is
created when a star's natural lifespan expires and it implodes,
collapsing in on itself. The gravity of such a collapse is so enormous that nothing can escape its pull, not even light itself. There
is a distinct border to phenomenon like these, called an event
horizon. Anything that comes too close, anything that crosses
the event horizon, is trapped by the black hole's intense gravity
and will eventually be consumed by it. It may be possible, with
sufficiently advanced technology, to escape the event horizon,
but in most campaigns, such things are typically beyond the
capabilities of a commercially available starship and are available
only to certain military or experimental craft.
Black holes, also called singularities, can be difficult to incorporate into adventures successfully because of their somewhat
terminal nature. Any encounter with a black hole has the potential
to be lethal for a starship and its crew, and there is little room
for error. Assuming a certain degree of technology on the part
of the characters, they could be hired to retrieve something or
someone trapped within the black hole's event horizon. Any such
endeavor would be incredibly pressed for time; there is a very
short period between the time an object crosses the singularity's
event horizon and the time at which it's consumed. The cargo
in question would have to be of great importance, possibly a
personage of extraordinary wealth or inﬂuence, or an object
that could not be replaced and that was necessary for some
particularly important task.
Perhaps the best use of a black hole in an encounter is as a
looming threat. An ordinary delivery or exploration encounter
could be dramatically altered when a starship's interstellar drive
fails after the vessel's journey through space is interrupted by

a singularity's gravity well. This transforms what the players
might expect to be a standard, light-hearted adventure into a
desperate race against time to restore the ship's systems and
escape the area before the inevitable. Such encounters must
be planned carefully so as to equip the characters for success.
A campaign that ends when the party is utterly consumed by
a black hole's inescapable gravity is generally not the desired
outcome for anyone involved, and it can understandably lead
to hard feelings among the group.
Somewhat more fantastic or existential encounters become
possible when the black hole serves as a gateway to another
dimension or location. Singularities used in this manner could
radically alter a campaign that has become stagnant or commonplace. Virtually anything can be introduced in this manner,
from vast alien civilizations to locales with radically different
laws of physics to dimensions where everything the characters
know is completely opposite -- a mirror universe of sorts. Used
in this way, the black hole can be the tool through which an
entire campaign can be transformed into anything the gamemaster imagines.

Comets and Meteors
Meteors are large chunks of rock that crash down to planets after being set in motion, frequently from an asteroid belt.
(They are often called meteorites should they survive entry into
a planet's atmosphere.) For whatever reason, the meteors come
free of their position within the system's asteroid belt and rocket
through space on inertia until they are captured by the gravity of
a moon or planet or simply cross paths with something bigger
than they are. If large enough, meteor can destroy all life on a
planet by dramatically altering the climate or atmosphere by
sheer force of impact. Obviously, most planetary governments
wish to avoid occurrences of this nature. Some control ﬂeets of
sufficient size to eliminate such threats, but if those ships are
involved elsewhere and cannot be freed (such as in the case of
a large scale conﬂict or other commitment), then they will hire
freelancers to deal with the situation. Events of this sort can be
both proﬁtable and noble endeavors for the intrepid crew of a
capable starship.

Hostile Environment of Space _
An unprotected character in space takes at least three
points of damage per round or one Wound level every two
rounds. One point comes from the exposure to the vacuum,
one from the exposure to intense temperatures, and one from
the lack of oxygen. (For characters using Wound levels, being
exposed to one of these factors results in losing a Wound
level every six rounds and being exposed to two of them
means a loss of a Wound level every four rounds.)
The gamemaster may increase the damage because of
a space debris shower, the intense heat of a nearby sun,
the cinematic effects of the setting, and so on. The gamemaster may allow Special Abilities or equipment to slow
the rate at which damage is taken or protect against some
or all of this damage.

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 5
Notes: Check out Erose's comet.

Comets, composed primarily of ice, tend to be more predictable than meteors because they have ﬁxed paths that they
travel regularly as they hurtle through the galaxy. Of course, if
the path isn't mapped yet, they could cross with the interstellar
ﬂight of a ship and damage the drive, causing a sudden halt to
the journey. Likewise, a slight altering of a comet's path could
send it toward a planet, where it could cause the same damage
as a meteor.

Cosmic Storms
Often related to nebulae, the so-called cosmic storms are vast
clouds of gas and charged particles that constantly discharge
incredible amounts of energy through them, much like atmospheric storm clouds. These storms can drift slowly through
the void, and although they rarely present a threat to planets,
they can have a devastating effect on space stations, ﬂeets, and
lone starships that happen to stumble across them. The energy
discharges they frequently exhibit can wreak havoc on a starship's
systems despite shielding, and they can disrupt or destroy virtually any part of a vessel's technology, leaving behind a lifeless
husk adrift in the midst of a cosmic hurricane.
Cosmic storms are somewhat different that the majority of
natural space hazards in that they are a mobile threat. Unlike
comets and meteors, they are far too large for there to be any
hope of neutralizing them ahead of time. Also unlike comets
and meteors, they are exceptionally slow-moving and can be
detected well in advance of their arrival. This allows for gamemasters to foreshadow the storm for lengthy periods of time and
use them as a distant threat, a background for initial encounters
in a campaign that slowly builds until it arrives near where the
characters' vessel is moored. This can provide a change of pace
as the characters ﬁnd themselves planet-bound for the storm's
duration, or it can be used to much more dramatic effect if the

characters' ship is docked at a space station when the storm ﬁnally
arrives. Although most modern space stations take precautions
against such phenomenon by employing advanced shielding,
survival is never assured under such dire circumstances.

Nebulae
Beautiful and potentially deadly, a nebula is a vast ﬁeld of
charged gases that dominates a large area of space, sometimes
light-years in length. These gases are relatively static in their area
of effect, although they do shift and ﬂow within their borders.
Over thousands or millions of years, these gases congregate and
create new stars, giving birth to new star systems in the process.
This rare event is the subject of great interest from stellar cartographers, but it has only been witnessed and recorded a handful of
times in galactic history due to its unpredictable nature. In many
ways, a nebula is the antithesis of a black hole. It's the fetal form
of a star waiting to be born, just as a singularity is the rotting
corpse of one that has died and now seeks to destroy others in
its ﬁnal hours. Despite that a nebula has the potential to bring
new life to planets after millions of years, and despite the beauty
that many ﬁnd in them, they can be every bit as deadly as any
other phenomenon detailed in this section.
As static ﬁxtures in the galactic landscape, nebulae are
typically well documented and identiﬁed on most modern star
charts. Any pilot with a reasonable degree of skill and access to
dependable equipment can avoid them almost without thinking. The excited gas particles that make up a nebula can play
havoc with a starship's advanced electrical systems, and those
who venture into one for whatever reason rarely emerge without
some form of damage.
Nebulae are best used as a backdrop for an encounter, serving
to block a means of escape or force a starship to remain in one
area for long enough to complete the scenario. Any conﬂictbased encounter could ﬁnd its
dramatic climax in a peril-ﬁlled
race through a nebula's outer
edge, and any explorationbased adventure might require
an intrepid crew to delve into
the nebula's heart in search of
some long-forgotten remnant of
the past.
Solar Flares and Supernovas
There are few things in the known
universe that simultaneously possess such incredible potential for
destruction and creation as a star.
With a few rare exceptions,
life cannot exist without the
warmth and heat provided by
a star. Life begins with these
brilliant jewels of the galaxy,
but unfortunately it can end
with them as well.
Relatively speaking, solar ﬂares
are largely benign in nature. The

Subdirectory > Effects of Gravity _
Every so often, characters are going to come up against
alternate gravities. Those accustomed to 1-G environments react
differently when gravity changes. For very cinematic and simple
difficulty modiﬁers, use the following values (based the ones
suggested by the "Combat Options" chapter of the rulebook).
> In low gravity, all Agility, Strength, and tool-manipulating
Technical attempts have a -1D (-3) modiﬁer.
> In null gravity, all Agility, Strength, and tool-manipulating
Technical attempts have a -2D (-6) modiﬁer.
> In heavy gravity, all Agility, Strength, and tool-manipulating Technical attempts have a +3D (+10) modiﬁer.
Gamemasters who want a little more detail in their gravity
situations can use these guidelines, which have been designed
for ease and cinematic action.
All acrobatics, brawling, ﬁrearms, melee combat, missile
weapons, riding, sneak, throwing, and lift attempts get a modiﬁer
equal to 1 for every 0.1 difference in gravity between 1 G and
the current gravity. (Round down.)
Example: In a 0.25-G environment, the modiﬁer is 7, while
in 1.2 G, the modiﬁer is 2. In 0 G, the modiﬁer is 10.
The gamemaster may also apply this modiﬁer to other Agility, Strength, or other tasks that depend on movement, lifting,
or precise manipulation. Generally, the modiﬁer adds to the
difficulty, but in some cases, especially lifting or catching in
low gravity, the attempt may become easier and the modiﬁer
is subtracted from the difficulty.
Any sleight of hand or Technical action that employs tools
risks having the tool or object used spin out of control (in light
gravity environments) or becoming too heavy to handle properly
(in high gravity environments) on a Critical Failure.
All movement rates equal the base movement rate divided
by the number of gravities. Thus, a character who can jump
2.5 meters in a 1-G environment jumps 0.8 meters in 3 G and
10 meters in 0.25 G.
The distance characters can throw objects also changes.
Divide the throwing distance by the gravity to get the new
distance. Thus, an object thrown ﬁve meters in a 0.01-G environment can travel 500 meters or until it leaves the affected
area or is stopped by something. This also means that objects
in 0 G can travel forever in a straight line, unless they exit the
ﬁeld or something stops them.
Falling damage is determined differently when the gravity
varies from 1 G. Divide 1.5 meters by the number of Gs to
determine the distance the character would have to fall in
order to sustain 1D of damage. (Round down to the nearest
half meter.)
Example: A character falling 10 meters would take 6D of
damage in a 1-G environment. If that environment is 3.75 G,
he gets that much damage after a 2.5-meter fall; while in 0.25
G, it would be 40 meters before he sustained that amount.
Another way to look at this is to multiply the damage total
(not the die code) for a similar fall in 1 G by the number of
current Gs.

This also means that a character can't fall in 0 G; rather,
the character is injured from being pushed into objects. (Apply
only the base damage, not any damage bonus.)
Gravity can affect how much damage a dropped object will
do. Multiply the amount of damage that the object does (the
total, not the die code) by the number of G. In 0 G, a dropped
item simply ﬂoats.
To determine how much an item weighs in the new gravitational pull, multiply the weight by the number of G affecting
the item. For example, a man weighing 90 kilograms in 1 G
weighs 180 kilograms in a 2-G environment. (For gamemasters
who wish to determine whether a character could lift his new
weight, the lifting difficulty is based on the difference between
the character's standard and the new weight -- not on total
new weight.)
Zero G generally has no effect on objects, except to make
them easier to move (because they no longer have a weight
-- though they still have mass and can still hurt if a character
runs into them!). An object in 0 G ﬂoats when moved.
Gamemasters may wish to impose permanent penalties
(in the form of Hindrance Disadvantages) on characters for
long-term exposure (a month or more) to unfamiliar gravity
conditions. Gamemasters may also add other factors (such as
recoil affects) to nonstandard-gravity situations, as they think
best suits their campaigns.

Low- and Null-Gravity Conditions _
When characters encounter low (less than 1 G) or 0-G
conditions, they use their ﬂying/0-G skill to perform actions
effectively. Since most species orient themselves to gravity
environments, they're often confused and clumsy in weightless
situations. Training can help the character understand how
body weight, counter balance, handholds, and other factors
work in weightless conditions.
As characters ﬁrst enter a low- or null-gravity environment,
they make, as a free action, a ﬂying/0-G attempt. The orientation difficulty is 5 for those with the skill or 10 for those who
default to the attribute. The characters use the result points
(the difference between the difficulty and the roll) to reduce
the gravity modiﬁer up to a maximum amount equal to the
gravity modiﬁer.
The modiﬁer lasts until the character gets a Critical Failure
on any roll or until the character leaves in the same environment (whichever comes ﬁrst). After the Critical Failure, the
character needs to take a moment to reorientate herself. As a
free action, she makes an orientation attempt again at the same
difficulty as the initial attempt. The same conditions apply for
the new gravity orientation modiﬁer.
Characters may also make the orientation attempt as a
normal action, to see if they can get themselves more accustomed to the environment (and lower the gravity modiﬁer
more). Those who wish to take extra time getting used to the
environment get the bonus for preparing.

exact cause of solar ﬂares have never
been precisely determined, as there
seems to be some strange variation
between systems. Some ﬂares
are caused by ill-defined
"storms" across the surface of
a star. Others may be generated by the ongoing chemical
reactions within the star's
heart. Still others owe their
origin to gravimetric ﬂuctuations
caused by asymmetrical orbits.
Regardless of their source, solar
ﬂares send pillars of ﬂame billowing out from the star's surface like
hairs reaching out from a head.
This analogy is far from perfect,
obviously, but the idea is essentially correct. Given how large a
star is, the "hairs" generated by
solar ﬂares are truly spectacular,
capable of completely vaporizing
entire star cruisers or space stations that may be too close when
this phenomenon occurs. Solar
ﬂares can also interfere with communication, sensor readings,
and navigation throughout an entire system, dramatically complicating even the most basic starship functions for days on end.
Used in this way, solar ﬂares need not even play a direct role in
an encounter to have a noticeable effect on the events over the
following few days.
A supernova is the cataclysmic death of a star. The fusion
reactions that take place in the star's heart gradually decay over
time, changing in style and composition. As these reactions decay,
eventually the star becomes unstable and extremely volatile.
When this reaches a critical point, the reactions can no longer
sustain themselves, and the star goes into a supernova stage,
detonating with the force of more nuclear weapons combined
than Humankind has created throughout the history of a
thousand worlds.
The effects of such an explosion are what might be expected.
The planets closest to the star are usually vaporized, with not even
gases remaining. Planets in the system's inner half are destroyed
when the shockwave reaches them, leaving little more than
asteroids and trace elements. Outer planets are broken apart by
the diminishing power of the explosion. The result is an empty
pocket of space where a thriving star system once existed, with
little more than the manner of debris one might expect from a
typical asteroid belt. (Alternately, the star might implode upon

Solar Flares _
The presence of solar ﬂares increases the difficulty of
all comm, navigation, and sensors roll throughout the system by +5, along with any other effects the gamemaster
wishes to include.

itself in the ﬁnal stages of its decay, creating a black hole that will
consume anything left from the system's destruction.)

Artiﬁcial Hazards
Natural phenomenon are hardly the only threats posed by
the galaxy at large. Despite that civilized beings utilize only a
fraction of the space that has been successfully explored at this
point, there are nevertheless regions that have deﬁnite dangers as
a result of some artiﬁcial creation that lingers after its designers
have long since departed the area. For whatever reason, either
through intent or happenstance, these phenomenon can be every
bit as threatening as any natural danger.

Debris Field
Battles fought on an interplanetary scale are terrible, gruesome spectacles. The raw destructive potential of even a single
star cruiser is truly frightening to behold, but a pitched battle
between two, or even an entire ﬂeet, can leave entire star systems hopelessly scarred for decades afterward. Although more
localized than an asteroid ﬁeld, the ﬁeld of debris left behind
following a battle can pose not only a signiﬁcant navigational
hazard, but a deﬁnite hazard to any ship that travels through it
even at a safe speed. This is particularly true with debris left from
primitive space vessels, some of which use dangerous chemicals
in their propulsion drives. Some pockets of these chemicals
persist, and they can be caustic enough to damage a starship's
exterior if left exposed for long enough. Anyone attempting to
exit the vehicle in such conditions would ﬁnd his environmental
suit quickly eaten away.
Despite the obvious dangers, debris ﬁelds are popular destinations for independent businesspeople for a number of reasons.
The ﬁrst, of course, is salvage. It's possible for entire sections

of a star cruiser to remain intact once it breaks up in a battle,
and these large pieces are full of electronics and weapons that
can fetch a spectacular price on the salvage black market. The
risks gathering such items are considerable, but the seductive
allure of reward is too much for many to overlook. Criminals
in particular are keen to acquire such forgotten weapons, as the
illegally obtained military weapons cannot be traced and there
is little worry that law enforcement will be able to track them
through records of sale and purchase.
Information is another major reason to return to a debris
ﬁeld. Many cruisers have compartmentalized computer backup
systems, and informational records can survive within these
systems for long periods of time even after the cruiser's destruction. Either side involved in a battle will wish to retrieve such
secrets following the battle's conclusion, and many third parties
as well. Even if the conﬂict is not military in nature, information
found in the wreckage may still be of great value to someone.
Mercenary or pirate ﬂeets that are involved in conﬂicts with
legitimate ﬂeets or various law enforcement armadas may leave
behind data that could serve as evidence of their many crimes
or provide the location of their hidden bases. On more than
one occasion, smaller scale battles have been fought between
starships and soldiers in space suits among the debris following
a major battle, as both sides attempt to recover the information
lost in the battle.

Abandoned Traps
For whatever reason, be it military, scientiﬁc, self-defense, or
megalomania-induced cruelty, there are instances when beings
leave behind devices that can only be described as traps. These
devices, sometimes ancient holdovers from a previous era, range
in complexity from crude explosives to elaborate traps designed
to imprison starships until they can be retrieved, something that
may not be possible as the creators are often no longer alive or
at least in the area to maintain them.
The ﬁrst and most basic type of trap is one designed to destroy
any ship that ventures into its area of effect. Proximity-activated
explosives and simple mines are the most common form of
these traps. There may be vast ﬁelds of mines that have been
located and defused by a galactic government, but thousands
individual mines could be still scattered throughout the galaxy,
waiting to be discovered by some poor, doomed starship crew
hurtling through the galaxy.
Proximity charges placed on asteroids through commonly
used passages are another common variation of this theme.
These traps can have far-reaching repercussions, as an explosion within any asteroid belt can create a chain reaction that
sends asteroids spiraling through space, where they may damage other ships, space stations, or even planets as they crash
through the system.
More elaborate, insidious, and far rarer traps are those that
are designed with a speciﬁc purpose in mind. These often involve
devices such as tractor beams, gravity-well projectors, electromagnetic pulse generators, and all other manner of powerful
machines. Some devices are created as a military project, as a
means to detain and capture enemy starships without need for
risking valuable assets in combat. Some more rationally minded

pirate groups prefer such techniques as well, as there is far less
chance of damaging the prize during capture if it has been denied
power long enough for systems to shut down. Some even go so far
as to allow the ships to lay dormant long enough for the crew to
expire before returning for their prize, guaranteeing no resistance.
A few corporations use similar tactics against their rivals, and even
certain scientiﬁc groups have experimented with such devices
beyond the frontier in an attempt to acquire specimens for study.
Commonly, these tactics are restricted, and those caught practicing
them without permission suffer enormous penalties. However,
space is quite vast and impossible to patrol completely.
Perhaps the most insidious and enigmatic use of traps is in
the hands of individuals whose motivations may or may not
be known to those who suffer their predations. Some wealthy
eccentrics ﬁnd sport in hunting starships like big game, trapping 
them in elaborately constructed circumstances that require
their crews to succeed at nearly impossible tasks in order to free
themselves. Others may be powerful, godlike beings who enjoy
testing"lesser beings" in order to learn more about mortality and
the abilities of those who do not share their power. Beings of
this nature, whether merely eccentric or truly omnipotent, can
serve as a recurring threat to any starship's crew and may even
upstage existing campaign villains for short periods of time.
These hidden dangers can serve as excellent sources for
encounters when the campaign is at a point where something
is needed to interrupt the normal ﬂow of events. If properly
designed, traps can provide an outstanding problem-solving
challenge for the starship's crew to overcome, perhaps exercising
skills that they are not often called upon to use.

Politics and Contraband
Despite the inﬁnite width and depth of space, there is no
single quantity found within it that simultaneously has more
capacity for insidiousness and nobility than the soul of an intelligent 
being. Just as the histories of thousands upon thousands of
individual planets are full of treachery, betrayal, war, and suffering,
so too is the galaxy's history full of truly wretched, unthinkable
acts of cruelty that are easily the equal of any harmonious event
celebrated throughout the known universe.
For additional ideas, see the "Space-Faring Authorities" section, 
which starts on page 7 in chapter 1.

Criminal Enterprises and Law Enforcement
Numerous ﬁlms and works of ﬁction have established the
charming scoundrel as a staple of the space genre of science ﬁction.
The notion of playing surly yet noble rogues, plying their trade
amidst the galaxy's seedy underbelly, can be quite appealing to
many players interested in a space-based campaign. Fortunately
for gamemasters, the genre is full of encounter material to cater to
the needs of such players. It can be a simple matter to construct
a campaign built on such ideas, or to introduce such elements
into a campaign of another sort.
In addition to the relatively common instances of criminalbased 
campaigns, it's also fairly normal to base campaigns on the
exact opposite premise: that of law enforcement. Bounty hunters,
sector rangers, galactic intelligence agents, and dozens of other
permutations on the same basic concept have their place in the

Subdirectory > Fleet Service _
The characters serve aboard a capital ship as members of
the crew. They might work among the rank-and-ﬁle, carrying
out the basic duties of comm operators, sensor trackers, shield
technicians, gunners, security officers, engineers, or even mess
hall cooks in the face of hostilities against an enemy ﬂeet. For
a more high-powered campaign, make the characters key
members with various command duties aboard the vessel: chief
engineer, bridge officer, gunnery coordinator, political liaison,
tactical advisor, executive officer -- even captain!

Adversaries and Allies _
This campaign requires an enemy and an allied military
force. Although the heroes serve aboard one capital ship, they
may receive assistance from other ﬂeet vessels accompanying
it in different missions as a task force or vast battle armada.
Give the enemy ﬂeet enough resources and capital warships
to provide a demanding challenge. Create a reason behind the
conﬂict: misunderstanding with alien diplomats, political or
ideological disagreements, or sheer conquest. Although the
characters' success and failure should inﬂuence the overall
course of the war, actions elsewhere in which they do not take
part may affect their theater of operations.

Starships _
Choose a capital ship that best suits the planned campaign
and the characters. The "Advanced Ship Design" chapter
offers sample characteristics for carriers and patrol frigates.
Smaller vessels like frigates and destroyers need require huge
crews and thus require personnel to undertake more duties to
ensure smooth operation. Larger craft like carriers, cruisers,
and battleships demand such immense crews that the vessel
often seems like a ﬂoating city.
After deciding which ship to use, develop enough details
about it to make the craft seem like a complete setting: game
characteristics, deck plans, gamemaster's characters, standard
regulations, typical crew characteristics, sample layouts for
quarters, mess hall, wardroom, and facilities the heroes to
use while on duty and off. Determine basic procedures for
standard operation, general quarters, damage and hull breach,
evacuation, and other emergencies.

Support Locations _
The ship on which the heroes serve functions as the central
location for the campaign. Here they
live, work, and interact with other
crewmembers. They don't always
face the enemy, and when they do, it
usually involves viewing them at long
ranges from bridge viewports, control
displays, and gunnery control consoles.
Nobody spends all their time in space.
Other locations may help the campaign along
and provide a change of pace from shipboard
duties. The characters might take shore leave at a

military depot, ﬂeet base, deep space station, or stardock repair
facility between operations. They might supervise drop-ship
operations for ground assaults. Should enemy ﬁre destroy their
vessel, the heroes might have to evacuate, using escape pods
to reach a habitable planet where they must survive despite
enemy attempts to hunt them down.

Adventure Hooks _
Secret Weapon: The heroes' ship attacks a smaller enemy
vessel in the course of its patrols, only to ﬁnd that their adversaries 
have concealed some new, more destructive weapon
technology aboard. Although the characters beat a hasty retreat,
they must gather intelligence on this new enemy weapon and
ﬁnd some way to defeat it before the ship (near their patrol
sector) decides to go on the attack.
The Prisoners: After a devastating raid against an enemy
supply convoy, the characters capture several escape pods
of personnel. They must manage their imprisonment and
interrogation to determine their captives' identities, the ﬁnal
destination for the convoy, and whether they know of overall
strategies for invading in this region. Several prisoners attempt
to persuade the heroes to join their side and liberate them,
especially before anyone ﬁnds out that the captives include
several high-ranking military officers.
Cat and Mouse: After a particularly desperate confrontation with a 
superior enemy vessel, the heroes' ship seeks to
hide within some astrographical feature that interferes with
sensors and communications: a nebula, cosmic storm, or
asteroid ﬁeld. The characters must maintain watch for the
enemy ship hunting them, carefully navigate through their
astrographical cover, and effect repairs so they can either
ambush or ﬂee their pursuers.
Saboteur: During a seemingly routine skirmish repelling
the enemy, the character's vessel sustains damage, malfunctions, or 
other failures attributed to sabotage. While the ship
travels back to base for resupply and repairs, the heroes must
uncover a secret agent working among them, reveal his plans,
prevent him from relaying classiﬁed intelligence to the enemy,
and stop his scheme to disable the ship at a crucial moment
during an upcoming battle.
Into the Trap: One of the heroes intercepts and deciphers
enemy intelligence claiming that they're aware of an impending
allied invasion of a border world
and plan to ensnare the task force
with a hidden ﬂeet of power vessels operated by elite crews. The
character and her comrades must
convince the commanders of their ship
and the ﬂeet to cancel the attack, or at least
alter their plans to prepare for increased
opposition, despite high-ranking officers who
have utmost faith in their strategy and refuse to
believe their plans have been compromised.

Subdirectory > Starﬁghter Squadron _
The heroes serve as ﬁghter pilots in a squadron on the
front lines of a hostile conﬂict: an open war against another
interstellar government or powerful alien species, a prolonged
police action against pirates, a civil war between factions in a
divided empire, or a ﬁght to bring renegade systems in line.

Adversaries and Allies _
Gamemasters should establish two different military forces
and ally the characters with one of them. As a unit within a
larger ﬂeet, the squadron receives some degree of support during its 
operations, but it primarily functions on its own along
the fringes of the war. The enemy ﬁelds an equally formidable
force: ﬁghter squads of its own, capital warships, landing craft,
elite commando units, heavy ground assault forces, spy ships,
and supply freighters. Provide some motivation for the conﬂict:
One side might prosecute an invasion of the other's territory.
The two factions might violently disagree about politics or
moral issues. The enemy might simply be bent on efficient
annihilation of the heroes' side.

Starships _
Squadron campaigns center around ﬁghter craft. Commanders assign each 
hero their own snub ﬁghter, light bomber,
or other small vessel suitable to the mission at hand. Sometimes
characters stick with the same craft the entire storyline; other
times their equipment varies.
Design suitable ﬁghters to help the heroes achieve victory
in combat and survive unfortunate incidents. Make sure they
possess enough armor, shields, and weapons to hold their own
in a dogﬁght, and allow for modiﬁcations for different mission
proﬁles against larger capital ships and ground targets. Devise
escape systems so heroes can eject and survive if enemy ﬁre
destroys their craft. Pack some survival equipment in a rucksack
behind the cockpit so they can carry on if they crash land on a
planet. Since everyone's in the same squadron, each character
pilots the same kind of ship.
Gamemasters can also use the light defender or strike
ﬁghter characteristics from the "Example Ships" chapter in
this book or the in-system defender characteristics on page
118 of the D6 Space rulebook.

Support Locations _
The characters require a base from which to sortie
against the enemy. Most squadrons are stationed aboard
capital-sized carriers, orbital facilities, planetside bases, or
some combination of the three if command transfers the
squadron between different hot zones. Each provides living
and recreation quarters, docking hangars, repair facilities,
and set defenses. Customizing a base with maps, military and
civilian gamemaster's characters, and detailed facilities can
offer more opportunities for roleplaying and provide heroes
with a "home" they can ﬁercely protect. Personnel aboard
capital ships might also engage in adventures outlined for
"Fleet Service" campaigns.

Adventure Hooks _

Preemptive Strike: Acting on time-sensitive intelligence,
headquarters assigns the squadron to engage an enemy force
entirely unprepared for a strike. The target craft occupy a
repair staging area and resupply depot with minimum defenses
behind enemy lines. At ﬁrst the raid goes successfully, with the
characters inﬂicting incredible damage against target ships.
Then fully operational ﬁghters and cruisers move out from
amidst the vessels under repair; the facility was intentionally
stocked with derelict ships to lure the heroes into a trap! The
characters must ﬁght their way out of stardocks, debris ﬁelds,
and advancing enemy craft.
Ground Cover: During an assault of an enemy-held planet,
the commander orders the squadron to provide ground cover
to infantry and mechanized artillery forces advancing on a
dirtside objective that must be captured relatively unharmed
(the capital city, vast supply depot, ore processing facility, 
communications array, power station, etc.). The heroes must fend
off intercepting ﬁghters, identify and destroy threats ahead of
the ground units, and disable defensive emplacements near the
target. Anyone who goes down crashes behind enemy lines
and must hold out until allies arrive.
Hold the Line: The squadron must hold its base, planet, or
patrol area against an overwhelming onslaught of enemy ﬁghters and 
light bombers intent on invasion. They must overcome
this assault through desperate ﬂying, carefully allocating their
resources, and defeating key craft and aces. Encounters include
head-on dogﬁghts with enemy craft; defense sorties to protect
crucial sensors, communications, and depot installations; and
running escort for incoming freighters with supplies vital to
the squadron's continued successful operation.
Guard the Retreat: The squadron's planetside base receives
orders for all military and civilian personnel to retreat to a
rearward rendezvous point in the face of devastating enemy
advances. The characters must delay an advance force sent to
capture the base ahead of the main enemy ﬂeet to give base
personnel time to destroy sensitive data and technology, scuttle
the facilities, and ﬂee in cumbersome, lightly armed transports.
Should any raiders get through, the squadron must chase them
down before they capture any vital intelligence or personnel.
The heroes must make sure their ﬁghters do not sustain such
damage as to prevent them from jumping to the rendezvous
system and trapping them behind enemy lines.

genre. The combination of authority, independence, and the
constant challenge of ruthless, violent opponents can be highly
enticing despite the lack of material rewards that playing the
opposite side of the coin typically offers.
Regardless of which option a crime-based encounter or
campaign focuses on, it's possible to create an atmosphere more
beﬁtting an inner-city police drama than a fantastic tale of aliens,
black holes, and the wondrous sites of the universe. Using space
as a backdrop, a campaign such as this can tell almost any tale
the gamemaster and players can envision, with the genre being
added for group appeal or scenic beneﬁt.

System Patrol Craft
Planetary governments are stereotypically paranoid agencies
typically staffed by individuals who are constantly fearful of
threats to their personal power. In a typical star system containing 
anywhere from 10 to 24 planets, it's virtually impossible to
monitor even a fraction of the vectors from which a potential
threat could approach. Even vast ﬂeets of starships could not
possibly expect to monitor all traffic into and out of a system.
The best a government can hope for is to place patrols and space
stations along the most frequently traveled routes and to distribute 
a reasonable number of independent system patrol craft
throughout less frequently traveled regions. System patrol craft
are not particularly powerful, but they are sufficient to deal with
most privately owned starships and small pirate cruisers. They
normally operate outbound, or out of dock, for weeks or months
at a time, making it more difficult for anyone attempting to follow
their movement to track them. At any given point, individuals
entering important systems for illicit purposes can expect there
to be two to three dozen system patrol craft circulating through
the near-star region, hunting for those will ill intent behind their
visit. (Less critical systems may get only a few patrol craft.)
An entire campaign could be developed wherein the characters take on 
the roles of a system patrol craft's crew. The
position would allow characters to enjoy liberal amounts of
autonomy and authority, not to mention a larger starship with
more powerful defenses, weaponry, and power system than
most commercially available craft. Given the lengthy tour of
duty such vessels normally enjoy, the patrol craft could become
much more of a focus in the campaign than a starship might
normally enjoy. A detailed ﬂoor plan of the ship would be of
great beneﬁt for such a campaign, as it would play an integral
role in each encounter.

File Name: Adventures in Space
Notes: Be careful of ﬁckle governments.

Smugglers
No criminal career has been so gloriﬁed in the space genre
than that of the smuggler, due in no small part to the inclusion
of smugglers in numerous popular ﬁlms that are considered
icons in the genre. Almost everything that can be appealing to
play in a space-based character can be found in some degree
in the archetypal smuggler. They can be suave, daring, bold,
independent, and cocky, or at least they have been presented as
such in many popular works of ﬁction.
Heroic smuggler encounters can revolve around the use of
a greater evil that places the acts of such a crew in perspective.
What harm comes of a little larceny or smuggling when faced
with the horrors of war or slavery? Characters who are not
involved in smuggling may come into contact with such individuals 
and receive an entirely different point of view based on
what transpires with them. Encounters with heroic smugglers
can present a theme of "lesser evils," in which smuggling essential
items such as food or medicine behind the lines of war-torn
or trade blockaded planets can provide not only considerable
proﬁt but also substantial relief to those who suffer from events
beyond their control.
Those with a more sinister sense of the galaxy may wish to
design encounters that highlight the more damaging side of
smuggling. Those crews who regard it as a noble profession,
perhaps inﬂuenced by encounters with heroic goals, may ﬁnd
that the universe is far less pleasant than previously imagined.
Smugglers do not only traffic in harmless but illegal substances
but also in many substances that have an impact well beyond
the small criminal circles in which they travel: weapons of mass
destruction, highly addictive narcotics, intelligent beings sold
into slavery, or priceless religious artifacts stolen from primitive
peoples whose culture spirals into chaos without them.
Pirates
Pirates are the quintessential threat of space travel, a ruthless 
danger created by the greed and violence of mortal beings
that lust after wealth and power at the expense of other beings.
Space is so unimaginably vast that at any given time only a
tiny fraction of it's ﬁlled with starships or space stations. The
rest goes unseen and unknown by the citizens of the civilized
galaxy. It's there, in the void between life and emptiness, that
pirates make their living. The threat they pose can range wildly
from small private craft equipped with improvised equipment

Pirate Campaign _

69

Seeking a campaign more suited for outlaw characters?
Adapt the "Fleet Service" setting (described on page 75)
and adventure hooks to a pirate vessel or ﬂeet, with the
galactic navy, rival privateers, and the customs service as
enemies; merchant vessels as targets; and friendly pirate
bands and criminal organizations as allies. Incorporate
a starﬁghter squadron for scout and interception duties.
Develop a haven where pirate characters can recuperate
from encounters with the law, repair their craft, and store
or sell their loot.

to entire ﬂeets of cruisers that can attack even the largest and
most well-protected trade groups without fear of defeat.
The most obvious use is the pursuit of the characters' ship by
pirates intent on taking their cargo. Any such encounter should
contain a sense of dread and helplessness as the pirates seize
what they want and leave the rest, with varying stages of violence
involved in the process depending on the pirates in question.
Independent starship crews are a cut above the rest, however,
and they may not be so inclined to let the matter rest. This is
understandable, and can lead to further encounters wherein they
seek vengeance upon those who have wronged them. Alternatively, 
they could encounter them again somewhere along the
line, granting them a chance to take back what is theirs when
the pirates least expect it.
Many great campaigns have been conducted with players'
characters taking on the roles of pirates. The starship crew may
take the form of privateers in some galactic conﬂict, or they
may simply be another ﬂavor of the same dashing rogue that
many imagine as the archetypal smuggler. Whatever the background, 
merchant trade groups, planetary militias, law enforcement agencies, 
and even other pirate groups can be potential
adversaries for a pirate crew. A truly creative encounter could
pit them against some greater foe in a temporary alliance with
one of the same groups, which always proves to be interesting
and complicated.

Slavers
Slaving is among the most despicable acts that can be committed 
against intelligent beings. Depriving another being of the
most basic freedoms and choices is a cruel, heinous crime that
only the most heartless individuals would even contemplate.
Unfortunately, the galaxy seems to have individuals of such a

nature in more than adequate supply. While slaving is against the
law in almost every advanced civilization, there are more brutal
worlds where such practices are perfectly acceptable, and there
are always groups or individuals who are eager to embrace the
inexpensive labor that slaves can provide, increasing their proﬁt
margins in any number of legitimate or illicit enterprises.
Slavers frequent the galactic frontier, where law enforcement
is sparse and potential slaves are more available. Primitive alien
species are among the most common victims of slavers, as there
are few speciﬁc galactic statutes against a particular race (although
there are still many against slavery in general), meaning the potential 
penalties are marginally less severe. In addition, the primitive
state of such beings, many of whom are plucked from tribal
civilizations, makes it easy for a handful of slavers to dominate
vast numbers of them with relatively little difficulty. There might
be instances of entire planets falling under the heel of a single
crew of slavers manning a lone starship with factory standard
weaponry. A starship crew's ﬁrst encounter with a primitive people
could be severely colored by that race's previous experience with
slavers, making them either extremely hostile to all off-worlders
or merely fearful in the extreme. A series of encounters could be
constructed around the premise of the crew discovering a new
world and slowly coming to realize the involvement slavery has
had in the development of their new friends' culture.
Presumably, an encounter for a space campaign would involve
the characters acting in opposition to slavers, as there are few
players who are comfortable participating in such an insidious
practice, even in a role-playing exercise. In the event of such an
encounter, the characters could face any number of different
opponents. The slavers themselves, of course, will likely not be a
great deal different from the characters: entrepreneurs who own
their ship and use it to make a proﬁtable living (though, in the
case of slavers, at the expense of other intelligent creatures). An
encounter such as this can provide a rather sinister reﬂection of
the characters -- a look into the potential for evil that the party
has (hopefully) managed to avoid thus far in their careers. Law
enforcement characters will have a clear and obvious mandate to
put a stop to any slaving activity immediately, though there may
be an element of undercover work involved. This could make for
an interesting encounter or series of encounters as the characters
experience the darkest side of the galactic criminal underworld.
Another recurrent theme involving slavery is that of a party of
criminals contracted to pick up an unknown cargo, which turns
out to be slaves. This can serve as a turning point in a campaign,

when the characters ﬁnally confront a line they will not cross
despite the potential for proﬁt or prestige among their
criminal cohorts.
It's possible to construct scenarios or campaigns
wherein the characters take the role of slavers, although
this is discouraged for use by all but the most experienced and 
mature roleplayers. Such encounters would
have a very different feel indeed and could perhaps
best be used as an ongoing background enterprise for
the characters that rarely takes center stage. When it
ﬁnally does come into the spotlight, an encounter could
be constructed so that it serves as a turning point, where
the characters ﬁnally realize the horror of their actions. Of
course, if the players are comfortable with the notion of
exploring the more sinister elements of roleplaying, then
they could continue in their efforts to whatever extent
the gamemaster feels comfortable involving them.

Hostile Intentions

74

Unfortunately, it seems that conﬂict is a universal
truth. There is no culture known to exist that does not
have some instance of war or violence liberally appearing in its 
history, and there are perhaps a handful of
planets throughout the galaxy where violence has been
eliminated from their culture.

Intergalactic Warfare
There are an almost inﬁnite number of reasons
that planets and governments go to war, ranging from
legitimate and irreconcilable differences in philosophy
to the greed of a handful of powerful, petty individuals.
Regardless of its cause, technology can further war such that a
conﬂict between two advanced cultures can lay waste to entire
solar systems, and the term "weapons of mass destruction" has
taken a new meaning. When a lone star cruiser can ﬁre weapons that 
can destroy an entire planet's ecosystem or unleash
torpedoes that can accelerate the fusion reaction within a star
until it prematurely reaches supernova millions of years prior
to its normal development would dictate, the horrors of war
are beyond all reckoning.
Despite the inevitable death and destruction that war brings,
it can nevertheless have a stimulating economic effect that can
spread across entire systems as planets scramble to produce or
purchase the materials they need to maintain their war efforts.
Traders and smugglers can ﬁnd a healthy business moving a
variety of cargos through restricted space. If a war goes on long
enough and becomes costly enough, some governments may be
unable to replace lost ships, and they may instead hire freelance
starships to take a variety of roles within their navy. Although
many privately owned starships are inappropriate for direct
combat duty without signiﬁcant modiﬁcations, exploration,
transport, and even medical ships may be required as ships
previously assigned to those functions are pressed into combat
duty. Even if only serving the war effort for a single encounter,
a large-scale battle can present a starship's crew with a sense of
the bigger picture in galactic events.

Less conventional encounters using war as a backdrop could
involve characters working in opposition to the war effort,
perhaps as agents of some third party. Criminal organizations
may ﬁnd that a protracted war effort begins to negatively impact
their proﬁts, philanthropic organizations may be opposed to the
conﬂict on philosophical grounds, or intergalactic corporations
with holdings in the domain of both feuding parties may wish
to protect their assets from potential destruction.

Privateers and Press Gangs

85

Privateers and press gangs (euphemistically described as
conscript training vessels) have their place in galactic affairs.
Times of war often cause shortages on both sides, particularly
if the conﬂict is a lengthy one of attrition. In such cases, it's
not uncommon for one or both sides to hire on privateers to
supplement their supply lines with materials seized from a list
of legitimate targets. These target lists are typically restricted
to the enemy, their allies, and any corporate entities supporting
the opposition more substantially than the privateers' sponsors.
Depending upon the alignment of the sponsor, however, the
privateers may be unleashed on any ship that contains resources
that could be beneﬁcial to the war effort.
Privateer encounters typically fall under one of two categories. 
Legitimate privateers can serve as a reminder to the crew
of starships that war is a vast unpleasantness that impacts
even those with no involvement with either side. A privateer
encounter can be used as a gateway tool to alter the course of a
campaign, involving the players' characters and their ship in the
conﬂict in whatever capacity the campaign demands. While this
experience can be as noble as required, it can also be a terrible
and scarring experience, as some privateers are little more than
pirates with a polite name attached to describe their activities.
In these instances, the reality of war is again reinforced to those
who exist beyond it.
In ancient times, press gangs were groups of pirates or other
nefarious sailors who kidnapped innocent bystanders and forced
them to serve alongside them aboard their ships. This premise
lives on in the space age, although it's far less common due to
the simple impracticality of the entire affair. While unwilling
captives aboard a starship cannot hope to escape their containment, 
there are thousands of ways for such individuals to seek
revenge against those who hold them, through sabotage, working
slow, being obnoxious, or otherwise resisting the conscription.
Although such an act would likewise complicate the life of the
captive as well, the risk of unruly captives is enough to discourage 
most ship captains, particularly when there are any number
of beings willing to serve a tour of duty on board a starship for
little else than the opportunity to escape their home world and
explore the galaxy at large.
Despite the impractical nature, there are mercenary bands,
pirate groups, and even planetary governments who are so
desperate for new soldiers or crewmembers that the practice of
conscripting the unwilling into their service is not unheard of.
It's necessary for training to be an expedient affair for something
of this nature, obviously, or else it would prove more timely to
simply clone or engineer new soldiers and crew. In the interests
of speed and convenience, many large agencies that require
conscripts employ vessels for just this task, known as conscript
training vessels. These ships are usually retroﬁtted bulk freighters
or other ships that cannot be used for a more military function,
thus preventing further loss of resources on the front line. The
ships are equipped with extensive training equipment and
often a signiﬁcant amount of subliminal conditioning devices.
Conscripts are sent through an exhausting training regimen at
threat of terrible punishment if they fail to comply. Those who
do as they are ordered are rewarded and reassured that after a
brief tour of duty, they will be returned home along with considerable 
compensation for their time. This is rarely the case,
but it's sufficient to motivate a surprising number of conscripts
into compliance. There is a signiﬁcant percentage of washouts
or people who die during training, of course, but the success
rate is sufficient to warrant continuing the process. The staff of
such vessels are usually comprised of castoffs from the regular
military (or whatever other agency is maintaining the vessel) and
those individuals who are too cruel, too injured, or otherwise
inappropriate for regular duty. These frustrated individuals ﬁnd
trainees the perfect outlet for their anger.
Players' characters conscripted into service will have considerable 
amount of work ahead of them. Surviving the process is
merely the ﬁrst step, followed by escaping from the vessel and
then reacquiring their own vessel (assuming it still exists) or

obtaining a new one. From that point, there are any number of
directions that the campaign could take, changing the scope and
direction of the game thus far completely. A fugitive campaign,
for instance, would require an ongoing current of desperation
and paranoia, wherein the characters could rely on nothing
except for their skills and equipment, ﬂeeing across the galaxy
from angry forces that wish to bring them to some twisted
form of "justice."

Commerce and Recreation
Starships are expensive to purchase, expensive to maintain,
and extremely expensive to repair. Choosing a spacer's lifestyle
requires a constant source of incoming cash ﬂow, a feat that can
prove difficult given the ever changing political and economic
landscape of the galaxy. Fortunately for spacers, there is a seemingly 
endless variety of jobs to be done, required by an inﬁnite
array of individuals, groups, and entities throughout the known
universe. The"Criminal Enterprises" section earlier in this chapter
details several such tasks that are somewhat less than legal, but
there are an equal number, if not more, of perfectly legal and
legitimate enterprises that can be used to fuel the adventures
of any starship crew.

Customs Officials
The bane of entrepreneurs both legitimate and illicit, the
customs official is a ﬁxture in starports throughout the known
galaxy. Theirs is the thankless, endless, proﬁtless duty of ensuring
that the thousands of cargo manifests that pass through their
assigned sector each week are accurate descriptions of the cargoes that are being transported, and that no illegal or restricted
substances are brought into or out of their designated areas. It's
a monotonous job, one without any particular reward other
than the ﬂeeting sense of a job well done or, for those who crave
excitement, the constant threat of angering dangerous individuals
who may attempt to kill them for merely doing their job.
Custom officials most often appear in an encounter as a foil
for the characters. Regardless of whether or not the characters
are transporting illicit goods, an encounter with an overzealous
customs official can allow even the most straight-laced characters
to experience persecution as if they were dastardly criminals. Of
course, if the characters are dastardly criminals, it makes such
an encounter all the more appropriate. Even more entangling,
the characters could encounter a customs official who is looking
for a bribe, or one who seems completely disinterested in his
job. While the ﬁrst has obvious potential for encounters, the

Subdirectory > Free Traders _
One of the heroes has acquired her own ship and decides
to go into business for herself as a free trader, roaming the
galaxy, seeking new and exotic cargoes to sell at grossly inﬂated
prices. The rest of the characters sign aboard as crew or fellow 
entrepreneurs. They travel to distant worlds -- some
settled, others only recently discovered -- to ﬁnd cheap
commodities that might fetch hefty prices in more civilized
systems. Although everyone hopes to make a huge fortune
off one cargo run, they inevitably spend their time chasing
down worthless deals, repairing old machinery on their ship,
avoiding competition from large trade organizations, explaining 
strange merchandise to suspicious customs officials, and
scrambling to make ends meet. Some free traders eventually
turn from honest transport jobs to more lucrative (and riskier)
smuggling assignments.

Adversaries and Allies _
Free traders have many enemies. Gamemasters can choose
one or several from this list, developing each with resources
of their own (ships, mercenaries, bases) and a primary reason
to harass the heroes:
> competing shipping corporations seek to shut down
small operators, but not before they cash in on their remote
commodities sources and other markets
> customs officials constantly suspect free traders of dealing
in stolen or illegal goods, and when they don't ﬁnd any, manufacture 
excuses to ﬁne them or tax their legitimate cargo
> some pirate bands prey on free traders assuming they're
cashing in on some newfound goods from an exotic world
> crime syndicates seek to collect on loans made from
credit-hungry free traders, either in cash or illicit favors, and
often send bounty hunters after those who fail to cooperate
> rival free traders and smugglers seek to drive off other
small-time competition, sometimes resorting to dire and
underhanded measures
Most free traders must depend on themselves for survival,
but some groups occasionally offer aid:
> petty nobles who depend on the heroes to provide valuable goods and services
> entrepreneurs who sell commodities free traders
import
> oppressed natives who depend on trade with more
civilized worlds to improve their standard of living
> starship mechanics who rely on the heroes as regular
customers
> scouts who chart previously unexplored regions of space
with potential for new commodities and markets

Starships _
A free trader campaign centers on the freighter the heroes
use to transport cargoes. Develop some background to explain
how the captain acquired his freighter (the "Your Own Ship"
section in this chapter offers several ideas). Decide with the
players what kind of ship best ﬁts their characters' needs. Make
sure it has adequate cargo space, shields and weapons to defend
itself, and accommodations for all the heroes. The light freighter
described in the "Advanced Starship Design" chapter provides
a basic cargo vessel well-suited to free traders (the characteristics also appear on page 118 of the D6 Space rulebook). More
ambitious characters might wish to ﬂy a larger freighter on a
capital ship scale. Although such bulk transports have superior
cargo capacity, they also require a larger crew, more armament,
and more expensive costs for overhead. Gamemasters should
spend some time with players before beginning a free trader
campaign to design a ship that's right for everyone.

Support Locations _
While the heroes' freighter serves as the campaign's primary
location, it's ﬂexible enough to take them to innumerable
worlds to carry out trade. Gamemasters should still develop
several stock settings on which the characters can rely.
Create at least one safe haven where the characters can ﬂee
to resupply, recover, and repair their ship. Remote or secret
locations work best. The haven might consist of a friendly
docking bay in a vast starport whose proprietor owes them
a favor. Their wealthy patron might offer one of her remote
estates for their use in emergencies. The characters might
have prestocked a bolt-hole on some isolated, uncharted
world unknown to the authorities. Gamemasters should use
this location as a story element beyond providing refuge from
enemies; keeping its existence a secret and otherwise protecting
it for future use could serve as the goal of an adventure.
The heroes visit numerous ports in the course of their
entrepreneurial activities. Gamemasters shouldn't feel they
must detail every one, but they should have some consistent
notes about the most-frequented starports. What planetary
authorities administers security and customs? What are some
key businesses and contacts the characters can use in port?
What can they proﬁtably buy and sell there? Where do they
stay overnight, take their meals, and ﬁnd recreation? Each
starport should have its own character. Some might strain
under the iron ﬁst of the local tyrannical government, while
others could have the atmosphere of a huge, chaotic party. For
some ideas on making notes about planets and starports, see
the "Sample Planet Log" sidebar on page 13.

become a mixed blessing when the official's superiors reprimand
or dismiss him outright and begin to review his most recent

a crime, the characters' ship could suddenly become the center of

questionable characters, this is an excellent opportunity to see
the other side of how the law operates. For legitimate traders,
it may simple by an opportunity to experience the enormity of
the task that officials face. Given that they will almost certainly
have a negative opinion of custom officials, as the vast majority
of traders do, this can be a chance to steer the party in a direction they may never have attempted.

Intergalactic Bazaars
The vast majority of all planets, star systems, and space stations closely supervise or tax cargoes that are traded or purchased
while using their starport facilities. On larger cargoes, these taxes
are usually not enough to substantially impact the proﬁt margin
for either party involved. A certain subset of traders, however,
prefer to carry large amounts of cargo broken into much smaller
lots, and conduct multiple deals in a single location. Fortunately
for such traders, most systems and governments make allowances for this manner of business in their tax and tariff laws,
protecting what basically amounts to small entrepreneurs from
fees designed to regulate much larger corporations. Some systems, however, do not have laws that recognize the difference
in such matters, and they tax each individual transaction. Legal
entanglements of this nature cripple small traders, completely
eliminating their proﬁt margin to the point where it actually
costs them money to conduct business in certain systems and
closing entire markets to their goods and services. To counteract this unfortunate legality, certain trade confederations and
merchant guilds maintain intergalactic bazaars in open space
near to but technically outside of systems that practice such
draconian trade restrictions.
Intergalactic bazaars, sometimes referred to by critics as
"intergalactic bizarres," are truly a sight to behold. The agency
or individuals sponsoring the event tend to bring in a handful of
large, bulk cargo freighters with most (if not all) of their holds
completely empty but pressurized and supplied with life support.

Ships arriving in the area pay a reasonable fee
to bring their cargo (or at least a manifest) on
board to conduct trade with other similarly
minded merchants. Starship crews who
prefer more privacy in their business
dealings may dock with one another as
they see ﬁt, or travel from ship to ship
via environmental suits. Those who do
not come aboard the bulk freighters may
still pay the fee to have their cargo manifest
and prices broadcast by the sponsor to all
nearby ships on a secure channel, notifying
any potential customers of what they have
to offer for sale.
These large scale gatherings are typically
frowned upon by most planetary or system
governments, but those who organize them
are careful to remain outside the jurisdiction of such agencies, and the problem is
far too insigniﬁcant to draw the attention
of any galactic authority. Pirates are a concern, of course, but between the security
forces the hosts usually have on hand and the
tendency of small, independent starships to ﬂee in all directions
at the sight of a pirate cruiser discourage most pirate groups.
As a result, an intergalactic bazaar can be a surprisingly calm
and enjoyable environment, and those who disrupt it quickly
ﬁnd that everyone will turn on them in an instant. Somewhat
understandably, no one likes the economic downturn that crime
and violence brings to such locations.
An encounter with an intergalactic bazaar could just as easily
serve as a bit of comic relief as for serious trading business. A vast
star ﬁeld with ships arrayed in a passable grid is a powerful visual
image that can entice players with a simple description. Such
bazaars are full of quirky personalities that are only interested
in the next sale and how to convince their customer that their
merchandise is the ﬁnest. Free-wheeling hucksters with dank,
cramped ships ﬁlled to the brim with all manner of curiosities
are the order of the day for such an encounter. Creating an
atmosphere of exotic, questionable goods is a simple affair. Add
to that the possibility of a unique chase scene, one involving
the characters pursuing or being pursued while outside their
starship in traditional environmental suits, and the scene takes
on the feel of a frantic Old World marketplace, complete with
a lengthy vehicle chase.

Free Trade Zones
Intergalactic trade laws can be an extremely complicated affair,
what with tariffs, taxes, and tracking systems that can involve
multiple planets and dozens of governments. Inexperienced
starship crews may discover that without proper planning, their
proﬁt margins are consumed entirely by the fees and penalties
they incur in transporting cargoes across systems. This economic
phenomenon has not gone unnoticed by entrepreneurs and has
given rise to the notion of free trade zones. These zones tend to
be highly discouraged by most governments, but enterprising
systems with an eye for bringing in tourism and business persist in

Accessing: D6 Space Ships File 5
Notes: Fantastic ﬁnds at D'ton Bazaar.

the practice. The premise is that entire systems can be designated
a tax-free, tariff-free zone wherein any two parties can conduct
private transactions without any interference from government
personnel. This type of arrangement is attractive to all manner
of individuals, both legitimate and illegitimate. Criminals can
make exchanges without concern for customs officials interfering in 
their business, and corporations can make deals without
allowing governments to cut into their proﬁt margins. With the
new cargo secured and possession clearly indicated through the
proper documents (which free zone personnel are all too happy
to provide for a small fee), the transaction is completed and
everyone leaves content -- at least most of the time.
Surprisingly, free trade zones are relatively crime-free environments. 
There are a vast number of criminals, to be sure, but few
wish to risk losing the privileges they enjoy in such a place by
turning their craft against their hosts. Considering the amount
of money such systems tend to make on inﬂated prices for food,
lodging, and starport fees, money that they turn and reinvest in
security, the prospect simply is not worth the risk.
The concept of a free trade zone is one that has enormous
potential for encounters. The most obvious use would be as an
attractive and recurrent destination of a starship crew that plies
a frequent trade as smugglers, couriers, or independent traders.
For such a group, the zone can be used to capture any number
of different atmospheres, from the hectic trading atmosphere
of New York's Wall Street to the frantic, free-wheeling chaos
of an open air market in the innermost regions of Singapore.
It can be a bewildering environment for characters, and one a
gamemaster can use to introduce new contacts, employers, or
crewmembers without great difficulty. Properly utilized, these
zones can become an enjoyable ﬁxture in a campaign, and one
that players look forward to revisiting as the encounters staged
there can be quite a departure from the normal emptiness of
space and the harassment by custom officials, law enforcement,
and government official of all types.
On the other hand, a free trade zone can serve an entirely
different purpose for other types of characters. Law enforcement 
personnel traveling the galaxy in search of their prey can
ﬁnd the zones extremely frustrating and challenging, given a
free system's tendency to avoid entanglements or dealings with
outside law enforcement whenever possible. Free systems allow
known criminals to walk openly in berths directly adjacent to
those occupied by the sector rangers who so frequently hunt
them. This is accomplished by an arrangement of system laws
commonly known as "active morality laws." These laws are the
subject of an ongoing, seemingly endless galactic debate regarding
their legality, but the essence of their content is that no one can
be arrested for nonviolent crimes in a free trade zone unless they
are in the act of committing them at the time of their arrest.
So long as criminals are careful not to commit any larcenous
acts during their visit to the zones, they cannot be arrested by
off-world law enforcement agencies.

Recreation
Sporting events in one form or another are wildly popular
on almost every planet in the galaxy. Competition is a favored
pastime of many alien races as well as Humankind, and the

gradual merging of cultures can create dozens of new sports as
existing sports are combined or adapted to new environmental
conditions and alien physiques. One type of sporting event that
remains consistently popular throughout countless systems is
that of recreational starship piloting.
The ﬁrst and most popular starship sport is that of racing.
There are dozens of circuits that have races in every condition
imaginable scattered throughout the galaxy. Asteroid belts are
a popular location for such races, as are the tumultuous atmospheric 
condition of large, storm-covered planets. Obviously,
races of this nature can be exceptionally dangerous, but most
reputable circuits maintain a large number of small, fast ships
that serve as rescue craft for the inevitable accidents. Even so,
there are a substantial number of deaths, and there is always
a movement by activists to have the races outlawed. Ironically,
the illegal racing circuits that might go unnoticed by the same
activists have a dramatically higher mortality rate, but they have
far fewer protesters and generally seem to be less objectionable
to most fans and observers. This is most likely because the indi-

Special Order: A wealthy aristocrat hires the heroes
to acquire a laundry list of diverse items found on several
different worlds. They might be medicinal, technical, or
artistic in nature. As they begin collecting the goods, the
characters realize another group of traders, bounty hunters, or commandos also seeks to collect the same items.
In some cases, the heroes must directly confront one or
more of these factions for possession of the sole item on
a world. They might also try deducing why their patron
wishes to collect this odd assortment of materials -- are
his intentions purely innocent, or is he pursuing some
sinister agenda that might affect the course of politics and
trade in this sector?

80

Blockade Running: A merchant promises the heroes
an extravagant commission (probably enough to pay for
their ship or some other debt) to deliver a perfectly legal
commodity to a world currently under blockade by invading forces or military vessels enforcing some punishment
against the planet. They heroes must avoid heavily armed
and aggressive blockade craft, plus ground units occupying the starport. What should they do when they ﬁnd out
occupational troops have imprisoned their buyer -- who
has their commission -- and impounded his warehouse?
The Red Box: A mysterious client pays the characters
an advance, and promises them a vast sum later, to deliver
a large red crate intact and unopened to a distant world.
They forfeit the sum if they open the crate or allow it
to sustain any damage. The challenge comes when they
discover several groups desperately want the box: crime
syndicates, pirates, bounty hunters, government agents, or
religious fanatics. The heroes must deliver the crate to their
client's vaults before these factions take drastic measures
to grab the box for themselves.

viduals who sponsor such races have a markedly lower tolerance
for disturbances -- those who disrupt them tend to disappear.
Regardless of whether a race is legal or illegal, there is rarely a
shortage of potential participants. The prizes for such races are
simply too great for daring pilots to ignore.
More dangerous starship sporting events range from live-ﬁre
targeting exercises (wherein daring crews defend themselves
against drones ﬁring powerful but non-lethal energy blasts in
an attempt to disable the crew) and literal death matches (where
crews are pitted against one another).
The targeting exercises take two forms: (1) multiple ships
are attacked simultaneously, and (2) single ships are assaulted
separately and timed. In each event, small drones are sent in
ever increasing waves against the participating starships until
they are ﬁnally successful in disabling them. The vessel
that endures the assault the longest is considered
the victor. Although there have been instances of
disastrous system failures resulting in contestants'
or even spectators' deaths, this is a relatively benign
sport with little risk. This is far from the case with the
(generally) illegal death matches.
There is a subset of any society that craves entertainment at any cost, with more and more exciting
events required to stimulate their jaded sensibilities.
For individuals such as these, there are many criminal entrepreneurs eager to capitalize on this desire.
Whether in the deepest regions of space or the most
turbulent atmospheres of uninhabited planets, various
underground producers hold a number of exceptionally
destructive competitions each year. Each crew pays a
small fee to enter and has their ship carefully examined
by circuit personnel. The results of these examinations
are kept private, but the gambling odds are often quite
telling in that regard. The crews are then given coordinates
somewhere in the area, usually referred to as the arena,
and told to wait for the signal to begin. Once the signal
is broadcast, the crews' intent is to destroy as many
other competitors as possible. Each kill earns a ﬁxed
reward, and these rewards are passed on to any ship
that kills another. Any ship that ﬂees the arena is
disqualiﬁed, and a kill is credited to the last ship to
attack that ship. The surviving ship, or the last ship to
remain within the arena, is also awarded a percentage
of the house's take on all gambling. Obviously, this can

lead to tremendous proﬁt for skilled ships. There are more repeat
competitors than might be expected, as canny competitors will
ﬂee the arena when their survival becomes untenable, allowing
them to enact repairs after the event and enter again once they
have corrected whatever weaknesses brought about defeat in the
ﬁrst place. Other ships may only be disabled during the conﬂict,
and circuit organizers frequently conduct debris examinations
following the event's conclusion. Granted, the primary purpose
for these examinations is for salvage, but there have been many
occasions during which the salvage crew has pulled survivors
from such ships, some of whom have gone on to repair their
disabled vessels and compete again.
Starship recreation can be used as single encounters or
entire campaigns. These events can provide additional income
for starship crews who have the skill, opportunity, and need
for such things. Such encounters can be an opportunity for a
crew to exercise skills that may only normally be called upon
in times of duress, and they can allow players to showcase their
characters' favorite skills and specialties. Campaigns can be
constructed around similar premises, should the players desire
an opportunity to create characters a bit outside the normal
templates. Professional athletes as space-based characters is
not a niche that has been explored a great deal in ﬁction or ﬁlm,
and can be a chance for a role-playing group to explore a wildly
different element of their favorite campaign setting.

What's in this Chapter

This chapter offers a fast planet creation system for those
who intend to do plenty of planet hopping. The system provides
just enough details to give a generalized overview of the current
state of the planet. Gamemasters should add information on its
history, cultures, customs, other planets in the system, and so
on, if the players' characters intend to stay there for any length
of time. Chapter 1 of the Gamemaster's Screen and Aid booklet
contains ideas for adding depth to the world. Pages 41–42 of
the D6 Space Rulebook offers suggestions on ﬂeshing out alien
characters; that chapter also has some sample races.

Creating a Planet

There are several key aspects of a planet and its people
described here, each with an associated table. Use the tables
to randomly determine what the planet is like, or simply pick
what seems appealing. Record decisions on the "Planet Design
Log" included at the end of this book. Also included on this log
are places to put down times to other planets and various costs
associated with visiting the planet.
When an aspect suggests rolling twice on the tables, either
come up with a creative reason why the duplicated entries coexist, or discard the duplicate and reroll.
Do not include the Wild Die when making rolls on these
tables.

Number of Objects in the System
Although these guidelines deal with one system, it can provide
ﬂavor to know how many other bodies there are in the system.
Roll 3D to ﬁgure out how many major objects there are in addition to the main planet and the sun. If the number is greater
than seven, roll 1D to determine how many of those bodies are
asteroids belts or comets (gamemaster's choice).

Number of Moons
Roll 1D and subtract 1 from the result to ﬁgure out how
many large chunks of rock orbit the main planet. The fewer the
moons (aside from zero), the bigger they are.
On a result of ﬁve, either the moons are very small or the
planet has a ring around it.
Moons create tides, and, by reﬂecting the sun's rays, they
serve as a source of light at night. They can also inﬂuence the
behavior of creatures living on the planet.

Atmosphere
Most planets of signiﬁcant size have some kind of atmosphere,
though a large passing body can rip it away. Native species can
breathe their own atmosphere, but they will have trouble in
other environments. Roll 1D on the table to determine the
composition

periods of time
Environmental suits required by Humans and
similar species to survive on this planet

Hydrosphere
This aspect shows how much of the planet is covered in liquid.
If the atmosphere is harmful to Humans and similar species,
then the liquid is probably not pure water -- the water might
be contaminated with other substances or it might be even more
deadly, such as lava or ammonia.

Common Terrain
This aspect reveals the dominate terrain on the planet, though
certainly not the only one. The exact nature of the terrain is
affected by the hydrosphere, length of day, and gravity, among
other factors. A dry world with a long day and high gravity is less
likely to exhibit a jungle or wetlands terrain than a moist with

an average day and low gravity. Gamemasters should adjust the
result based on previously determined factors, if desired.
At minimum, roll 2D on this chart, though gamemasters
may wish to roll twice on the table to get primary and secondary
terrains. As this is only a sampling of possible surface conditions,
gamemasters may feel free to substitute any conditions that they
desire for the ones listed here or include a subtable under the

Because the genre rulebooks are based on the same system,
there's no need to worry about changing difficulties, modiﬁers,
or the like. Design a ship works the same as described in this
book, though gamemasters may wish to further restrict what's
available to spaceship designers. Gamemasters may also wish
to multiply the cost and the price difficulty by 2, 5, 10, or some
other number, to reﬂect the lower availability of space-faring
vehicles in most modern and near-future settings.
As the skills in both systems are generally not the same,
this aspect of conversion requires the most work. Use the
accompanying chart to determine the D6 Adventure skill most
equivalent to the D6 Space skill. (The list contains only those
skills referenced in this book.)
Note that some of the equivalent D6 Adventure skills indicate
that a focus (listed after the slash) must be purchased. The focus
costs the same as the full version of the skill, due to the highly
technical nature of it. Gamemasters may choose to impose a less
severe penalty on someone who has the basic skill but not the

equivalent foci on D6 Adventure skills, or simply
drop them under tech and repair. In speciﬁc: Flight
systems repair skill deals with the ability to ﬁx onboard
systems, including communications, sensors, shields,
engines, and the like. It does not cover the ship's
weapons, armor, hull, or computers. Gunnery
repair is needed for ﬁxing ship weapons, while
armor repair is needed for working on the hull
and its armor. Computer interface/repair aids
with the computers.
