introduction
Who am I? That’s not important. Let’s just say that I
might be a bard who may have angered a certain fairy
once upon a time, and as a result is forbidden from
mentioning his name in his writings. (Tip to all young
men: Fairies are notoriously jealous.)
Anyway, I accepted a tidy sum of silver to scribe a
guide to some of the more unusual places within our fair
lands. (Okay; technically I’ve had a rather substantial
debt forgiven as a result of my agreeing to this project
. . . let us not quibble the bits.) Another friend of mine
penned a composition on several of the interesting
settlements in this region, while a third provided a
treatise on castles, including a few examples.
I presume that my fellow bards managed to get their
facts and ﬁgures on their own, as they mention nothing
of how they came by their information. I, however, was
given the most dangerous section to expound upon,
and my exploits may make more sense if you know a
bit more about who my band of companions is.
The leader of our group is Okent, a paladin within a
holy order devoted to upholding the good and protecting the innocent. I’ve never known a more eﬀective
leader, mixing determination and compassion in a
way that’s compelling enough to make even me stick
around through thick and thin.
The healer of our group is a priestess named Raichael,
a woman who is as holy as she is beautiful, and I could
go on and on about her beauty if I wasn’t afraid she’d
see this and break my ﬁngers. Although I have visited
her temple many times, I still don’t know who or what
she worships. Apparently one of the core tenets of her
faith is that the name of her deity (or deities) is sacrosanct; no one who isn’t a true and heartfelt believer is
to ever hear the deity’s name.
Our oldest member is Grubba, but that’s only because
Dwarves are so long-lived. I don’t want to be stereotypical, but I will say Grubba is a humorless, hard-working,
industrious, ﬁercely loyal companion. I also confess to

having tossed him once in the heat of battle
to break an enemy’s lines. I think he enjoyed
that, given the slightly higher inﬂection in
the curses he hurled at me.
As for me, I’m the youngest of the group.
I’m as good at writing as I am at sneaking
and hiding, and each skill set has enabled
me to get out of sticky situations the other
skill set created. I’ve had it said that, despite
my protestation, I’m a good friend when the
chips are down, but I like to think I don’t know
what I’m capable of, since the chips could fall
even further yet.
The more I see the world with my companions, the more I realize there’s so much left I
want to see. While some things vary all over
the world, other aspects remain the same. The
discovery of the new and the comfort of the
old. Making new friends and seeing old faces.
The world is big and the adventure is just
beginning. I hope that you’ll ﬁnd this book
as useful as it was interesting to create.
May all your travels be ones you can write
about, and may you live to write all of your
travels.
The game mechanics in this book are based
on the system found in the D6 Fantasy Rulebook, but the general information, including
the random location generators, is suitable for
any fantasy campaign.

Settlements
My friend has stayed in some pretty interesting places
in his travels. Here’s just a few of the most notable
settlements from his trip around the world.

Delmara,
Forest-side
Hamlet

Standing alongside a trade route is the small hamlet
of Delmara. The ancient deciduous forest that edges
the city provides the inhabitants with the material for
housing, fuel, and trade. Carpenters, wainwrights,
and shipwrights favor the ancient hardwood trees
in the area, providing most of the 300 denizens with
a valuable commodity for barter. Those in Delmara
who are not foresters rely upon farms for their sustenance, selling their excess nuts, fruits, vegetables,
and livestock at markets. Even though the hamlet is
small, it’s situated upon a heavily traveled trade road,
bringing many merchants to the settlement. In turn,
Delmara’s solitary inn is quite successful and is a
favored gathering point at sunset. Not even Bede
Trowbryde, Delmara’s mayor, is immune to the
appeal of the Forest Nymph Inn.
Although the fertile ground makes the land
surrounding Delmara perfect for farming, its
rich soil lacks an abundance of stone. Over
the years, many people have attempted to dig
a stone quarry, but each attempt has failed
as there’s seldom enough stone for the construction of more than one or two buildings. The majority of the structures in
the settlement are wattle and daub
buildings. These are constructed of
woven strips of oak, covered with
a mud and straw plaster to insulate against the cold
weather.

Delmara Forest
Spanning for miles around the hamlet are the tall,
brooding hardwood trees of the Delmara Forest. Bards
sing songs about this ancient woodland, and the
resilient trees. The songs recount a history of a forest
imbued with magical properties, tended and farmed by
Elves. The Delmara Forest in these songs is often called
the Bowood Forest, as it’s told that for centuries elves
used the trees to make beautiful and powerful bows.
Most folk in Delmara consider this nothing more than
a folktale. Certainly many bowyers have attempted to
construct bows from the hardwood of the trees, but
none have succeeded, as the wood either cannot be
bent or snaps during shaping.

Darkwater Swamp
Just north of Delmara is the foreboding Darkwater
Swamp. This place is avoided by all of the inhabitants
of the hamlet. Both animals and people have lost their
lives in this treacherous region. Many folk believe
that the swamp is not natural, that it’s a living thing
itself. It’s said that it often calls to those who wander
within its sight, luring them into its watery clutches
with familiar voices. Or its fetid stench is replaced by
an alluring smell of food that leads animals to a watery
grave. At night, for those who dare to look, lights are
often seen ﬂoating over the black waters, dancing about
as though they were alive. All who visit Delmara are
warned away from the Darkwater Swamp.

The Hamlet
Pushcart Market: Just oﬀ the road, north of the
Forest Nymph Inn, is where the local farmers gather
each day with their pushcarts. In this small, mobile
market, fresh fruits and vegetables are sold. Salted
and smoked meat is also oﬀered. While the hamlet is
small, the market sees much traﬃc, as all of the locals,
and some travelers, frequent the spot for food. On
occasion, a traveling caravan that oﬀers cloth, spices,

Settlements

•5

pottery, and other rare products joins the farmers. By
noon each day, the pushcarts vanish as quickly as they
appeared, only to return again on the morrow.
Church: One of the few buildings to be constructed
of stone is Delmara’s church. In the early years of the
hamlet, the cleric Cernay Avers arrived, and with his
newly acquired ﬂock, constructed the church. Believing
the daub and wattle building did not properly serve his
deity, Cernay convinced his sect to rebuild the church
in stone. It’s become an emblem of Delmara’s staunch
and steadfast devotion. Many travelers who encounter
Cernay ﬁnd him a triﬂe over zealous. The locals tend
to overlook his determined attitude.

Bede Trowbryde’s House: Opposite the Fang River
from the church stands Delmara’s second stone building, the mayor’s house.
When the building was
ﬁrst erected, the intention was to make it the
abode of the elected
mayor. As it happens,
Bede Trowbryde has
been the elected mayor
for 20 years. Most of
the people in the hamlet now simply refer
to the dwelling as the
“Trowbyrde House”
or “Bede’s House.”
Because of the stone
and mortar used, the
building stands twostories high, and is
quite comfor table
compared to many of
the smaller residences
in Delmara.

Kiselton,
Riverside Town

Nestled upon the banks of the Durbin River is the
town of Kiselton. With a population of over 1,000,
it’s a booming trade center that relies upon its salt
mines as a chief source of revenue. Like most settlements of its size, Kiselton has a ruling council and a
mayor to perform the civic duties, such as appointing
a sheriﬀ, negotiating trade agreements, and collecting
the taxes required to maintain the town’s dock, roads,
defensive walls, and government buildings. Over the
years, Kiselton has done well, attracting laborers to
work in the mine for wages seldom seen in smaller
villages or warrens. Along with the opportunity for

6

so-called heroes are the true perpetrators, and the members of the council
anticipate their arrival.

Settlement
Considerations

Rumors of War

Settlements in fantasy settings vary depending upon many
factors. Population, resources, location, and trade are often
the inﬂuential elements that give a settlement its distinct
personality, whether it’s a small hamlet or a booming metropolis. Some locations serve focal points for trade and travelers,
while others may possess small populations but have abundant mineral mines or farms. Gamemasters need to consider
these aspects when designing settlements or when heroes are
exploring them. Every city is distinct. Intrigue, adventure,
and excitement are plentiful in such places. Avoid making villages nothing more than spots to purchase equipment; doing
so, while sometimes entertaining for players, slows the pace
of a scenario. This is not to say that the players’ characters
should not be allowed to resupply; rather, gamemasters can
take advantage of this to introduce subplots, new characters
or entirely new adventures. The locations included in this
chapter serve as templates and ready-made settlements for
immediate use. Additionally, the “Settlement Design Sheet”
provides a quick system for creating hamlets, villages, towns,
cities, and other similar places.

greater earnings comes a broad range of entertainment,
attracting more residents with a variety of talents to
the riverside town. Its ease of access makes it a popular stopping place for travelers, caravans, and various
touring merchants.

The Salt Mines
Located northwest of Kiselton is the vast series of
underground salt mines that have brought the town
its rapid growth and wealth. Each year, several tons
of salt are pulled from the earth and sold to smaller
and larger cities, near and far. Although the work is
wretched and dangerous, it’s the lifeblood this thriving riverside settlement. The recent deaths of miners
have forced Mayor Garvin Belot to place city guards
inside and outside the mines. No one in Kiselton is
sure what or who is killing the workers, but the talk in
the taverns is that a monster is lurking about, feeding
upon warm ﬂesh.
Such rumors do not sit well with the mayor, or the
ruling council. At every opportunity, all town oﬃcials
deny claims of monsters; instead, they place the blame
on rogues, claiming that soon a band of brave souls will
arrive and oﬀer to rid the town of the “bandits.” These

• Chapter One
Perhaps council members have
hired ruﬃans in an attempt to oust
the ﬁrmly planted mayor. Or maybe
they hired toughs, but there’s also a
monster prowling about. However,
should the players’ characters hear the
rumors and oﬀer to help, the mayor
doesn’t hesitant to have the sheriﬀ
arrest them, and he proclaims he has
captured the villains responsible for
the deaths, hoping to keep the favor
of the people.

The Town

With wealth often comes a fear of
losing that wealth. As Kiselton started
to prosper, one of the ﬁrst undertakings of the ruling council was to
construct defensive walls around the
town, leaving only the riverfront open.
Each wall has a guarded gate, which is
normally open during daylight hours. During the night,
the gates are closed, though the guards remain. Gaining
entry to the town is much more diﬃcult at night, as the
guards carefully inspect all who wish to enter.
Here are a few of the locations with the town, but
there’s plenty of other places that weren’t visited during
a visit not too long ago. As things hardly ever change
in these little places, it’s likely that other visitors will
ﬁnd the sights familiar from these descriptions.

Locations in Kiselton
1. Government House (Mayor’s Abode): This
luxurious manor was one of the ﬁrst town structures
to be erected. Beautifully tended, old hardwood trees
surround the structure, providing plenty of shade for
the three ﬂagstone patios situated on the north, west,
and south sides of the building. Standing two stories,
constructed of stone and mortar, the Government
House is the location for council meetings and trade
negotiations with merchants and emissaries from
neighboring cities.

2. Temple: Kiselton’s temple rivals the Government
House in size and beauty. Entirely built at the cost of
the temple’s followers, it’s another of town’s prominent structures. Not only does it serve as a house of
worship for the locals, it also provides boarding for
its growing number of clergy. Presently, the temple
houses 15 priests, but it’s capable of rooming twice
that number.

3. Durbin River Inn:
This inn existed years
before the city walls were
erected around Kiselton.

It’s a favorite haunt of the riverboat crews and roadweary travelers. Its sturdy wooden frame stands
three-stories high, and it has 20 rooms, varying from
cramped and windowless on the lower ﬂoors to large
and brightly lighted on the top ﬂoor. As with most
settlements, the local inn is a locus of rumors, gossip,
and shady deals.
Renting a room at the Durbin River Inn varies in
price with the quality of the room. Cramped, single
bed rentals are Very Easy (10 copper pieces), while
large two- and three-bed suites are Moderate (four gold
pieces). Jurin is not fastidious when it comes to cleaning the cheaper rooms. Dust and discarded material are
included in the low-budget rentals, and the bedding is
crawling with lice. These extra amenities are not found
in the upper, more expensive suites.

4. Dock: While commerce is readily conducted by
road, it’s much easier by water. This is truer when
transporting heavy loads of salt. While many of the
neighboring settlements haul the precious mineral
by horse, along the rutted roads leading to and from
Kiselton, the larger cities use riverboats, carrying vast
cargos of salt to be resold to even more distant locations.
As a result, the dock has become an essential part of
the town’s economic success. It’s not diﬃcult to hitch
a ride on one of the riverboats — for a small fee paid
to the captain, naturally.

All who spend an evening at the inn
are likely to hear numerous rumors.
The gamemaster can use the following
table for determining random rumors,
deciding which is true and which are not.
Amend the table to suit the needs of an
existing adventure, if desired.
1. A clandestine band of thieves practices their trade in town. They identify
each other and communicate through
secret gestures.
2. The mayor is planning on expanding the dock. The ruling council had a
private meeting. They intend to purchase the houses along the river before
announcing the plan, so that they can
buy the property at a low price.
3. The priestess at the temple is an
excellent healer. It’s said she came here
from a distant city, hiding from the
elders of her order for a crime she committed.
4. Monsters did not kill the mineworkers! The mine
foreman had them murdered to slow the production
of salt. The foremen have been secretly mining it and
selling on their own.
5. The mines run deep into the earth. Something
has been disturbed there, something that should not
have been awakened.
6. The bard Selwyn of Burch knows many histories
of Kiselton and the local lands. Often he visits the inn,
regaling customers with forgotten tales and delightful
songs.

Inachon’s
Point,
Coastal City

Perched on the side of a coastal mountain is the
seaport city of Inachon’s Point. For over 200 years, the
city has served as a coastal beacon with its towering

Settlements

•9

lighthouse. Inachon’s Point is a free city-state, ruled
by a six-member governing council and an Assembly
of 500 citizens, legislating for a population of nearly
100,000.
Decades before the city’s founding, it served as a
base for pirate ﬂeet that scoured the coastal cities,
plundering every place encountered. But all residents
of the now thriving trade and port city agree that the
ugly history is behind them.
Defended by massive stones walls, a rocky outcrop,
and the sea, this maritime settlement is well protected
— which was part of the appeal for the original pirate
base. Visitors to the city ﬁnd plenty of soldiers patrolling
the streets and docks. While all are welcome to enter
the magniﬁcent city, those who disrupt business or
cause civil unrest are dealt with severely.
From a distance, the brilliant white houses of lime
and sandstone catch the sun, making Inachon’s Point
shine like a gem. Even at night, its lighthouse blazes,
warning ships of the shallows and welcoming them
to a delightful haven. Merchant ships, caravans, and
traders all descend upon the thriving city
each day. Spices, textiles, precious metals,
gems, and common and rare items are all
to be found within its time-worn walls.

The Port
When the city’s location existed as a
pirate base, a lonely, ramshackle pier served
all the ships that ventured into port. But
after the pirates were forced from their
stronghold, the newly formed Assembly
constructed a marina that extends for
nearly one mile. This mammoth undertaking has served Inachon’s Point well.
It allows over 100 ships to dock and load
or unload cargo. Like most other areas
of the city, soldiers patrol it. Damage to
the harbor would be catastrophic for the
city’s economy. All those who threaten this
important part of the city are executed for
the crime.

The Bazaar
Located near the port is the open-air
bazaar where merchants sell, trade, and
barter all manner of goods. Day and evening, the bazaar bustles with traﬃc, its
narrow cobblestone streets so crowded that
simply moving from one end to another is

time consuming. During the hot afternoons, many of
the merchants hang rugs above their stalls, oﬀering
shade to their customers in the hopes of selling more
wares. Lamps and candles guide the customers once
the sun sets, while the enormous ﬂames from the
lighthouse add an eerie cast to the area. But all business ends at midnight: Even the proﬁtable merchants
need to rest.
Heroes who venture into the maze of merchant stalls
and pushcarts are likely to ﬁnd most anything they
could need. The air is redolent with the sweet and spicy
smells of cooking food, the calls of hawkers, and the
consistent buzz of amazed customers. Unless a player’s
character is familiar with the bazaar or has a guide, he
must make either a Moderate streetwise or a Diﬃcult
search attempt to ﬁnd a particular merchant during the
day. The diﬃculty increases by +5 at night.
If a hero is in search of a particularly rare item (such
as a well-crafted weapon, poison or exotic materials for
spells), increase the diﬃculty by +10 during the day and
+15 during the night. A guide familiar with the twisting

10

streets of the bazaar can reduce the diﬃculty by 10, but
an incompetent one can make things worse!
The prices in the bazaar vary from day to day. A
gamemaster might change the location or price each
day, or require a player’s character to haggle over prices
— the more unusual the item, the greater the cost.
Some items have such high prices that heroes might
have to work for the merchant before the fee is met.
Many merchants in the city hire daring adventurers to
seek out extraordinary things to resell.

Kasen the Merchant
For the entire 40 years of his life, Kasen has lived in
the city of Inachon’s Point. From outer appearances, he
is a moderately successful spice merchant — but this is
deceiving. During the years of toiling at his stationary
wagon, Kasen has acquired a vast amount of wealth. He
has also purchased stalls for family members who, while
not as successful as he, have done well for themselves.
Although Kasen has much experience, this is not the
secret of his success. Rather, he sells unusual potions
and incense that possess nearly magical qualities. His
years of working in the bazaar have provided him with
numerous contacts from distant shores, and the amazing qualities of his product have made him a favorite
among warriors and wizards. His goal is to one day sell
his stall and move to a large house above the city. To

• Chapter One
protect his investment, he sleeps in
a caravan wagon in the bazaar, and
he has hired two guards, who never
leave his side.
Because of Kasen’s renown, many
potential customers seek him. Trying to get Kasen to part with some
of his special stock requires a suitable (and successful) interaction
attempt, greased by an appropriate
monetary oﬀering. The merchant
response much better to charm than
anything else.

The Scar
Nearly at sea level, running along the outskirts of
the bazaar is Inachon’s
slum quarter. This district
of the city is the oldest,
and it looks its age. Scattered throughout the ramshackle neighborhoods
are the occasional stone
buildings, but for the
most part, the structures
are comprised of rotting
wood. Age and the damp
wind have conspired to
destroy many of the once
beautiful residences and
stores.
Gathered in this neighborhood are the laborers
who load and unload cargo.
There are far more people
then there are jobs, so each
morning thousands of the
Scar’s denizens trot to the
docks, each waiting in line,
hoping to be selected for

work. The pay is low and the work is hard. But desperate people work for desperate wages.

Fane’s Tavern
Sitting among the myriad rows of unassuming buildings in the Scar is a shuttered shack that has served as
tavern and secret guild house for decades. Although
history tells that the pirates who once called Inachon’s
Point home are long dead, it isn’t the case. On the contrary, the pirates have simply adapted. When sailing
the seas and stealing gold and jewelry became too risky,
many of the former seamen traded their sea legs for
walking boots — soft-soled walking boots.
On the surface, Fane’s appears nothing more than
a rats’ nest of a tavern. All respectable citizens of Inachon’s Point avoid the despicable site. But underneath
its haggard façade is the gathering place for the city’s
thieves. Beneath the ﬂoor of the tavern is the cellar
where meetings, plans, and territories are discussed.
The descendents of the forgotten pirates do not limit
themselves to stealing from wealthy houses. They help
themselves to cargo on the docks — bribing soldiers to
watch the stars while barrels and crates vanish into the
night. They also smuggle cargo into the city, avoiding
tariﬀs and taxes, allowing them to resell it to merchants
on the cheap. This is accomplished by a series of smugglers’ coves that pepper the coastline, with a maze of
tunnels leading beneath the city. The members of this
exalted guild are sensitive about freelancers.

12

members of the guild are ruthless in
remedying the situation.

Politics
One essential element in designing a settlement is the
political system. The very nature of villages, towns, and
cities requires them to be organized under some form of
rule of government.
The type of political system used in a settlement is mainly
determined by the gamemaster in the end. However, consistency does make fantasy locations more credible — although
bending the rules of politics can create intriguing and memorable places. To make a hamlet or metropolis fascinating for
players, a gamemaster can allow them to discover through
roleplaying the type of government present. As the heroes are
likely to travel from one land to another, from one kingdom
to another, from one city-state to another, it’s quite plausible
that they would not be aware of the laws of each place they
stop. If the laws or politics of a settlement is an essential part
of the location’s “personality,” then the gamemaster needs to
deﬁne these elements before the players’ characters arrive.
However, it’s not necessary for a gamemaster to become
entangled in the complications of politics to devise a political system. Sometimes using an land lord who is appointed
by a king is suﬃcient. Unless the politics of a settlement are
essential to an adventure, then all that need be done is to
provide enough surface information to give the village or
town plausible background. The list in the “Types of Leaders”
sidebar gives some common possible political systems that
can be used when designing a settlement.
Of course, each of these basic political structures can
be modiﬁed with various ﬂavors of political philosophies
such as democracy, communism, oligarchy, monarchy,
republic or constitutional government, and scores of others. Possibly the best rule that a gamemaster can adhere to
when designing a government for a settlement is the rule
of consistency. Avoid placing political systems that oppose
each other within the same borders, unless the realm is
a collection of city-states. Don’t create laws that conﬂict
with a settlement’s politics simply to control or confuse
the heroes. And equally important, keep the politics in the
background unless it’s essential to the story.

Any thief who attempts to practice her trade inside
the city is certainly going to encounter a member of
the guild. Such an event is only a matter of time. When
this happens, the “scab” thief is given the option to join
the guild, usually by performing several jobs that are
both risky and proﬁtable, or the thief is told to leave
the city. If one or the other option is not accepted, the

• Chapter One
Fane, Tavern Owner
Fane is a spry man in his mid-ﬁfties,
with dark hair streaked with gray. He
is rotund, friendly, and unimposing.
Underneath this friendly exterior is
the head of the thieves’ guild, and a
ruthless criminal. Although he no
longer practices his trade, he does
train and guide the members of his
guild. He assures their interests are
protected by eliminating any other
guilds that vie for power, and by
preventing any outside thieves from
working the city.
Any new customer who enters
Fane’s business is carefully scrutinized.
Unable to resist practicing his art to
some degree, Fane greets all new faces
with a warm smile, while patting them
down for money and belongings. He
never steals anything; he just sizes up
his prey. He doesn’t’ want to draw any
attention to the tavern by having a client accuse him or one of his customers
of theft. Once he knows the “worth”
of a person, later that night he sends
out one of his guildsmen to acquire
the goods.
Besides being the leader of the
largest underground business in
Inachon’s Point, he is also a useful
source for rumors and information.
Heroes who manage to befriend him
ﬁnd him a useful ally for garnering
secrets, gossip, and news.

High Town
Sprouting from the mountainside
upon which the city’s lighthouse
rests are numerous residences, each
growing larger as they move upward.
This quarter of the city is where the
money lives. It can be seen in the
limestone-plastered houses, and
the mansions lining the cobblestone
streets. Groomed gardens and spraying fountains are common fare for this
neighborhood. Few residents walk the
streets, preferring to ride in carriages.
Every morning, there’s a great exodus
from High Town as the servants plod
down to the bazaar to purchase food
and daily necessities. Unlike the lower
levels of the city, this is the land of
successful merchants, bankers, politicians, and city oﬃcials.

populace or by speciﬁc oﬃcials. These oﬃcials in turn might
be elected, or they might have the ability to foresee the
future, thereby making them the best people to choose
a ruler. The ruler might be of average ilk, be a persuasive
orator, have demonstrated leadership ability, possess
mystical qualities, or claim birthright. The title can vary
from chief to constable to mayor, depending upon the
nature of the settlement.
Appointed Leader: In some cases, this class of ruler
doesn’t diﬀer much from an elected leader. However,
in most instances, an appointed leader is one who has
been granted the rule of power by a higher authority in
an empire, kingdom or city-state. Titles for this class
of ruler vary from consul, governor, pro-consul, mayor,
lord, or prince.
Self-Appointed Leader: Occasionally these rulers are
benevolent and concerned about the welfare of the people
they govern. In most instances, though, they’re tyrants
who have come into power through money, otherworldly
means, or military might. These self-appointed leaders
might adhere to a rigorous military code or be religious
zealots, determining laws by whim and interpretation of
their belief system.
Ruling Councils: Rather than limit governing of
people to a solitary person, ruling councils have multiple
members, ranging from two to hundreds. These rulers
could be selected by a law that requires each member of
the settlement to serve as a member of the council, by the
drawing of lots. Or they might be elected or appointed,
depending upon the political landscape of the country they
occupy. This is also a common system of government for
large city-state that are independent of greater rule.

Phylo Duran,
Librarian

Besides being a library with a vast collection of
manuscripts, it’s also the residence of Phylo Duran. His
private rooms can be found on the highest ﬂoor. On
warm days, he stands upon the ﬂat roof, either reading
in the sunlight or gazing at the horizon.
Even though Phylo is a lighthearted man, he doesn’t
let everyone peruse his collection of tomes. Heroes
longing to gain entrance to this large and unusual
library must ﬁrst persuade Phylo. A hero that succeeds
through charm or bluﬀ is welcomed into the library. If
she fails, she must return on another day, and Phylo
adds a +2 bonus to his opposed mettle total. For each
failure, another bonus accumulates.
Another approach is to engage Phylo in a scholarly
debate. Again the player’s character makes an opposed
roll against Phylo, both using their scholar skills. If
the player’s character wins, the librarian is stumped
and invites the character into the library for further
discussion.
The last alternative is the use of a letter of reference.
The persuasion or reading/writing total used to craft
the letter must beat Phylo’s reading/writing roll by
ﬁve points, as he’s always careful to examine a letter

The somewhat eccentric librarian lacks
good interpersonal skills. He spends much
of his time with books, which seldom speak
back. The endless years of one-way conversations has made Phylo a bibliophile and an
introvert. He is lanky, gray haired, and 55
years old. He tends to overdress and is seldom seen without a book in hand. The truth
is Phylo feels awkward without the heft
of a volume of lore to balance him. When
engaged in conversation, he occasionally
turns away and commences reading from
whatever book he is toting around. He is
very imaginative, so sometimes when an
idea is lodged in his head, he tends to stare
into the distance, pondering whatever
thought has captured his fancy.
The peculiar librarian is a diﬃcult man to
befriend. Even if a hero manages to charm
him, this only lasts for a few hours, after
which, Phylo grows weary of the person’s
presence and requests her to leave. The
only sure method of gaining the man’s
favor is by entering into a debate with him
or by presenting him with an interesting manuscript.
Because of his vast collection, the character’s scholar
roll must beat Phylo’s scholar total, with a +5 modiﬁer
to the librarian’s total. If this succeeds, the hero has
gained a lifelong friend.

The Library
1. Entry Hall: This is the main entrance to the library.
The door is made of oak with iron rivets hammered into
the wood to strengthen it (Toughness of 3D). Most of
High Town’s residences consider this an unnecessary
security measure that only reduces the beauty of the
neighborhood. However, it does make the door much
more diﬃcult to smash. (Picking the lock has a diﬃculty
of 22.) Also located in this hallway is a trapdoor, which
leads to the cellar. The door is normally locked and has
a diﬃculty of 15 to successfully be picked. The cellar
stores mostly food and wine.
2. Common Library: Shelves stacked with books,
scrolls, and loose paper clutters this room. In the center
is a reading table, and a ﬁreplace is set into the eastern
wall. A tall ladder leans against each shelf, providing
access to the higher texts in the room. In the northeast
corner is an iron spiral staircase leading to the next
level. Performing a search in this room with a diﬃculty
of 15 reveals the majority of volumes on the shelves are
historical and probably only of interest to local scholars.
(Exceptionally high totals may reveal a hidden book of
obscure and valuable signiﬁcance.)
3. Rare Collection:
This smaller room oﬀ
the entrance hall is
designed for private
study. It also has a
collection of unusual
manuscripts, many of
which discuss legendary beasts and magical practices. Heroes
who use search have
a diﬃculty of 10 to
ﬁnding some of Phylo’s
personal notes.
4. Second-Level
Hallway: The spiral
stairs that lead to this
level continue upward,
all the way to the top
level. Locked and set
in the eastern walls of

this hallway are two doors. The locks on both doors
have a diﬃculty of 15.
5. Forbidden Volumes: This library only Phylo
and his most trusted associates may enter. It contains
several volumes of works that would prove dangerous
in the wrong hands. Rumor of this precious library has
reached ears as far as the Scar — Fane has even heard
of them but has not devised a method of acquiring
them that won’t result in his capture. If asked, Phylo
simply claims that this room is storage. A successful
opposed roll of bluﬀ against Phylo’s bluﬀ allows a hero
to discern that Phylo is ﬁbbing about the room.
6. Storage Room: This is a storage room. Inside
are several crates of bound manuscripts and barrels
of scrolls that Phylo hasn’t inspected yet. After he
scans them, he places them in the proper location in
the library.

The Scroll of
the Lost City
Secreted away in Phylo’s library is a lengthy scroll
that describes a lost city located deep within a desert.
The unknown author of the manuscript describes
the city as being covered by a sandstorm, and all of
its occupants smothered in their homes. While the
document itself is no more than one century old, the
knowledge it contains dates back several centuries.
There are enough clues in the book that a character,
through careful examination, could ﬁgure out where
the lost city is.

16
Additionally, scattered throughout its pages are
also spell fragments. With some months of study, a
player’s character can piece together these fragments
and form entire spells.

The Point
Nearly 1,000 meters above the city, at the highest
point of the stony mountain, rests Inachon’s lighthouse.
It’s guarded day and, as it’s the guiding beacon for
those who journey to the city. As night approaches,
one guard carries a torch, climbing a spiraling staircase,
to the stone summit. There he ignites the wood that
burns until morning. Each morning, the guards clear
the summit and restock the wood so the lighthouse
has fuel for the next night.

Smugglers’ Tunnels
Staggered along the coast on both sides of the city’s
port are numerous smugglers’ tunnels. When Inachon’s
Point served as a pirate base, these subterranean routes
were often used to transport material and people in and
out of the city. Although most people have forgotten
them, Fane and his gang have not. Thieves regularly
use them to haul cargo in small boats to and from
ships anchored oﬀ the coast. Forming a vast network
beneath the city, it’s possible to exit at most any place,
providing the person navigating the tunnels knows her
way around. The tunnels require a Diﬃculty navigation
roll to get through. A roll can be made once per hour.
A failure means that the hero spends another hour
searching the tunnels for an exit. To ﬁnd a speciﬁc
exit from the tunnels, one other than the one that was
used to enter the tunnels, the diﬃculty increases by
+5. The gamemaster should add modiﬁers if the hero
is in a hurry or is traveling without a light.
The tunnels themselves are rugged and ﬁlled with
water. In most areas, the water is only waist high, but
in other locations, it requires swimming or the use of
a boat to pass through. Unless a hero has experience in
the tunnels, there’s no way of knowing which passages
contain which depth of water.

• Chapter One

Izmerlia,
Tree Village

An important feature of a treetop settlement is its
precarious location. An abode built into trees might be
ordinary to those who live in such a place, but certainly
it proves a challenge for those who spend most of their
existence on the ground. When moving about the top
of a tree city, the characters should make regular acrobatics rolls to check for slipping or tripping. Failing an
acrobatics roll possibly results in falling to the ground,
unless the character succeeds in second acrobatics roll.
If this happens, the fortunate hero has managed to
grab hold of a rope, branch, or other feature that she
can use to prevent herself from falling any farther.
The diﬃculty of the catching attempt depends on the
circumstances and the amount of equipment the hero
is carrying.

Living Structures
Just as with a ground settlement, the resources and
the skills of the inhabitants determine the craft and
materials used in building habitats. For denizens of a
tree city, the materials are readily available. But to cut
or saw the trees seems to go against the grain of forest-dwelling beings. Rather, the structures of a tree city
utilize the living forest. With the aid of ropes, weights,
skill, and possibly magic, the trees can be “trained” to
grow in the desired fashion, using branches for walls
and a canopy of leaves for roofs. This makes the living
quarters in a tree organic and ﬂuid, not set apart from
the surroundings but a part of the forest. Additionally,
the furniture and other large amenities are likely to be
formed of living wood.
Such architecture not only is a part of nature, but
causes the habitats to blend into the trees, camouﬂaging them well. Heroes passing by a forest city are likely
to spot it only on a Very Diﬃcult search roll. Those
with a penchant for building structures (and some
related crafting skill) may receive a bonus to their
search attempt.

Defenses
The best defense for a forest settlement is its secretive
nature. Walls of stone or wood would certainly bring
attention to it. Instead, Izmerlia uses a militia. These
trained scouts keep watch miles from the perimeter of
the city, and they either attempt to lead unwanted visitors astray, or sneak ahead of the intruders to warn the

Settlements

• 17

city. Should a foe ﬁnd Izmerlia, then the
forces within the tree city are marshaled
and the living wood structures form an
excellent stronghold, impervious to all but
the hottest ﬂames and easily defendable
from its high vantage point.

Ascra, Elven
City guard
For the last 10 years of her life, Ascra
has served as a member of Izmerlia’s city
guard. She patrols the outer edges of the
forest, keeping vigilant watch on all who
enter. She has become so practiced at hiding and sneaking through the forest that
she has taken to listening in on foreign
conversations, mainly for news of the
world beyond the forest. Any intruder she
fears might discover her city, she attempts
to lure away in another direction. She does
this by openly passing through the forest
at a distance from the intruding party.
After she has captured their attention,
she moves away from Izmerlia, slowly
increasing the distance between her and
any pursuers. Once she feels the city is
safe, she pulls on her Elven cloak and fades
into the shadows of the forest. She’s only
aggressive if the forest is being harmed.
Within the last year, Ascra has been paying close
attention to all who visit the forest. A vile fungus has
started growing on the trees of her city, slowly killing
the beautiful creations of nature. Izmerlia’s ruling
council believes dark magic is behind the appearance
of the fungus, and they’ve been unable to prevent its
spreading. However, the council refuses to look for
outside help, not wanting to reveal the location of
their ancient city. It’s this that Ascra doesn’t entirely
agree with. She has seen little success in the research
of the fungus. She hopes to ﬁnd someone — a mage,
scholar or other knowledgeable person — who might
help to destroy the evil growth. Her habit of listening
to the chatter of those passing through the woods has
intensiﬁed as she yearns to encounter someone who
might oﬀer a solution.
Ascra has become desperate. If she overhears anyone
who seems familiar with forests, she approaches them
cautiously, with the sincere hope of gaining help. She
knows that doing so will cause her problems among the
city council, but she believes there’s no alternative.

Typhon,
Undersea City

Not far oﬀ the coast of Inachon’s Point is an underwater city. As might be expected, the city is not occupied by
water-breathing creatures; rather, it’s home to a group
of ancient wizards who long ago decided to hide from
the intrusions of other beings. Deep on the sea ﬂoor
are the crystal domes that the wizards grew to form
the protective shells of their cities. The transparent
crystal can not only withstand the fantastic pressures
of the deep water, but it’s also able to “breath” the sea
water and extract oxygen, while it absorbs the polluted
interior air and exudes it into the sea.
There are countless sailors’ tales about a glowing city
in the sea. In part, these tales are true, because ship’s
passing over Typhon at night can see the illumination
from the crystal domes. Many sailors mistake this for
the reﬂection of the moon, but those who have seen
the glowing undersea city on moonless nights know
better. Spending any time in the nearby Inachon’s Point
turns up rumors of this unusual settlement.

Government
Because of Typhon’s unique environment, the
number of inhabitants entering and leaving is limited.
While there are forays to the surface, very few new
people are allowed to enter the city — or even know
of its location. New residents must meet the approval
of the majority of the citizens. The people of Typhon
have a truly democratic government in which there’s
no central authority. Instead, every member of the
habitat has an equal say in the writing of laws and in
decision-making. This has also led the people to have
communal property. As acquiring new items and raw
material is a diﬃcult undertaking, much of what is used
in the settlement is shared. There’s little individual
property; aside from a few personal trinkets or clothes,
all of it belongs to the community.
On the rare occasions when someone is needed
to visit the surface, the entire community selects a
candidate. Because of her familiarity with the surface
world, for the last few years the community has always
chosen Tiu Mali.

• Chapter One

Domiciles
Most of the construction of Typhon relies upon the
materials found upon the ocean ﬂoor. As collecting this
material is diﬃcult and time consuming, the inhabitants of Typhon have developed interior sea pools that
allow them to grow tremendous shells, which they
use for building homes within their crystal-domed
environment. The farmers of these shells have become
so proﬁcient over the centuries that they capable of
growing shells in almost any size or shape. They’re
used for plates, cups, utensils, furniture, walls, and
other objects. The shells are also ground to create the
thin tiles used as manuscript pages.

Transportation
The talented mages of Typhon have managed to
develop a spherical crystal that can move beneath the
water with the aid of some magic. The few who trade
with the surface use these vessels to travel. It’s large
enough to hold multiple people, although usually there’s
just a solitary occupant, which leaves space for cargo.

Tiu Mali
At age 11, Tiu started studying the history scrolls
about the surface world. She then voraciously read every
manuscript that was brought back from each surface
trip. While most of Typhon’s inhabitants cared little for
the world outside, Tiu hungered to know more about
it. Over the years, she became a prominent scholar and
the city’s most knowledgeable person about the surface
world. On each trip she made to the surface, she studied
the languages, read scrolls, and studied the cultures
and practices of those above the water. As a result, she
blends in with the surface people very well.
Tiu is a charismatic woman of age 28, with long dark
hair, rich green eyes, and a charming smile. Although
she’s extremely curious, she tries to hide it under a
façade of shyness. Most on the surface who engage her
in conversation ﬁnd her quiet and timid. Of course,
this is a ruse to avoid too much contact. She fears that
her accent or some oﬀ-handed remark might attract
unwanted attention.

Gadara,
Island
Nation

Not all settlements adhere to what
most of the world considers the “rule
of civilization.” Located in remote
and isolated areas are small groups
of superstitious people who use
primitive technology. On the island
of Gadara, there exist such a people.
They dwell in huts made of bamboo
and woven leaves on an upthrust of
land with around 20 square kilometers
of surface area. They’re not a seafaring
people, so they have only visited the
local chain of islands close enough
to reach by canoe. For generations,
they’ve dwelt on a bountiful island and
have seldom encountered outsiders.

The Jungle
Serving as a backdrop for the main
village is a thick jungle with heavy
underbrush. Even to the villagers,
the jungle is a hazardous place ﬁlled

Cities
The grandest of all settlements are cities. Populations of
such places range from the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands. Quite often, these are the economic
or political capitals of nations.
These vast urban areas are typically devoid of the
farms and mines common to their smaller brethren. Such
resources have long ago been drained in large cities, requiring nearly all the necessities for living to be imported.
Seldom are these booming environments lacking in manpower, as countless people travel to large cities in search
of wealth and work.
One of the dangers facing large cities are the threats of
conquerors. As a result, city rulers tend to spend extravagantly upon civil defenses, including soldiers, war machines,
and stockpiles of food (should there be a siege).
Another aspect of vast settlements is the unique architecture. Proof of power can be found in large civil ediﬁces and
ornate buildings. Tremendous structures or marvels cause
visitors to stop and gaze in awe. But for as much money
that ﬂows through the hands of the wealthiest city, there
are countless poor. This dichotomy between extreme wealth
and extreme poverty often results in the development of
city quarters or neighborhoods. Most every large city has
a dilapidated section of houses where the unemployed
and poor congregate. It’s often in these seedy areas that
heroes ﬁnd the most adventure. Such environments are
perfect for experimenting wizards or secret guild houses.
Very few people inspect the downtrodden parts of a city
with a careful eye.
Along with the fusty quarters come the wealthy warrens. Here’s where the city’s elite live and celebrate. These
sections of a city are well guarded, both by city guards and
by private guards. Rather than broken-down wood frame
houses, the posh portions of a city are more likely to have
granite and marble residences. And most commonly, this
section of town exists upon higher ground. This allows the
waste and sewage to ﬂow from the lavish quarter into the
lower, and poorer, districts.
Political intrigue, murder, kidnapping, revolution and
rioting are all ailments for large settlements. Simply by
entering the city’s gates, adventurers can become embroiled
in all manner of exciting challenges.

with wild animals, dangerous reptiles, mud pits, and
quicksand. Seldom does a hunter venture into the jungle
alone, instead traveling in groups, killing as much food
as possible to stave oﬀ another trip as long as possible.
To these islanders, the jungle is a demon that longs to
devour them with its vicious spirits.
Heroes attempting to move through the jungle can
readily become lost, and they ﬁnd progress is extremely
slow because of the dense foliage.

The Village
The village itself has a population of several hundred,
and there are a few hundred more living in extended
family groups and scattered around the island. All that
the people need can be found on the island or in the
water. As a society, they have a uniﬁed religion, and
their priest rules the island.

The High Priest
Living in the largest hut in the village is the High
Priest, Namo. Upon the death of Namo’s father, the
previous high priest, stewardship of the village and the
people transferred to Namo. He rules the people with
the guidance of spirits and visions. Once a year, the
village sacriﬁces a member to appease the god of the
sea, to prevent his wrath. The selection of the sacriﬁce
is a duty that Namo doesn’t take lightly. It’s an honor to
be chosen, and he is very judicious in his selection.
Recently Namo has been besieged by dreams of “outsiders,” people from beyond the island who threaten
it. In his dreams, Namo sees men come to take the
treasure of his people, and to bring a new way of living
that leads to the destruction of his tribe. Knowing these
dreams are portents, Namo prepare for a visit from
the strangers; he intends to oﬀer them as sacriﬁce to
the god of the sea.

Finding Gardara
Certainly the island of Gardara is not on any map.
So, its discovery must either be by chance or by a rumor
learned from a sailor. As a play upon the dreams of
Namo, the heroes’ ship be tossed upon the island by
a tempest. With such an arrival, Namo undoubtedly
sees the storm that brought the heroes to him as an
act of the sea god.
Once the strangers arrive, Namo doesn’t want them
to leave. His visions tell him that he must sacriﬁce the
outsiders, and that’s his intention. He, at least initially,
comes across as a friendly ruler who’s anxious to learn
about the strangers. He relies on charm as long as he
can, but he resorts to force if necessary. Heroes who
make a Moderate investigation roll realize that Namo
is hiding something, which the other villagers know
about but won’t discuss.

Rhakotis,
Secret Library

Rumor of massive and ancient libraries have passed
the ears of many scholars, historians, and mages over
the centuries. To most, the libraries remain nothing
more than folktales, but for a few, they’re a dream
realized. For centuries, poets, philosophers, mystics,
musicians, artisans, and countless others have labored
to amass large collections of knowledge in secret
locations. Each one is a marvel of determination and
dedication. All who visit any one of the libraries never
forget the things they behold.
One of these libraries, the Rhakotis, has grounds
that are vast and protected by high stonewalls with
patrolling guards. The front gate, with a portcullis, is
the only visible means of entry into the library. The gate
is open during the daylight hours, but it closes at dusk.
Only those who live in the library and select visitors are
allowed to remain on its premises after sunset.

There’s also a charge for those who wish to live

Selling Items
The librarians and curators of the library are voracious collectors. However, because of the enormity
of its holdings, unique new oﬀerings are becoming
increasingly rare. Rather, knowing what’s lacking, the
head of the library often hires people to acquire desired
items. These undertakings certainly pay handsomely,
but they’re usually arduous tasks fraught with danger.
Some needed acquisitions include locating ancient
stone tablets that have been cited in other texts in the
library; capturing wild animals that the library’s zoo

Desert Nomad
Camp

Deserts are dangerous places for even the most
experienced traveler. The scalding heat during the day
and the frigid nights combined with the lack of water
often brings the death of people and animal alike. This
is why veterans of this harsh environment travel in
groups. Perhaps the most experienced of the desert are
the nomad tribes that endlessly wander the seemingly
barren lands, surviving for generations.

• Chapter One

A typical band of nomads varies in number from 50
to 300. The solitary leader, sometimes almost tyrannical, usually claims birthright. There are always several
lieutenants ready to ﬁll the position in case of an
unexpected vacancy — occasionally precipitated by an
impatient lieutenant and a number of supporters.

The Dahae
Under the command of the ﬂamboyant leader
Mukhtar, the Dahae tribe has been very successful.
During his years as leader, the tribe has gained great
wealth and infamy. With over 200 riders, the Dahae
are not limited to robbing caravans or raiding villages.
Fortiﬁed cities and supply trains for armies are some
of the tribe’s new targets under Mukhtar’s guidance.
Their reputation as excellent horseback warriors has
also brought them oﬀers from kings to join armies as
mercenaries.
By their nature, the Dahae do not remain in one location for long. They’re hardy and have learned the ways of
the land, adapted to the environments they enter. But
it’s the desert that’s their greater protector. Knowing
they cannot stand against an army — and many nations
long for the destruction of the Dahae — they dwell in
the deep desert, where the heat and sandstorms shield
them from the massed troops of enemies.

The Camp
Tents, horses, camels, waterskins, and packs ﬁlled
with food and loot are the primary features of a
Dahae camp. It’s among the ergs and hammada that
these nomads settle between raids. To the Dahae, the
ergs, or shifting sand dunes, are allies. Inexperienced
travelers easily fall prey to the soft sands of an erg, or
become lost overnight after a sandstorm has changed
the terrain.
There’s also the hammada, or the “frozen” sand dune.
Over countless centuries, the sand has hardened, forming rocky plateaus, barren of vegetation. These make
good landmarks for those who venture into the desert,
as they’re virtually permanent.
Another common feature of a nomad camp is its a
secret water hole or well. The Dahae, like many other
desert tribes, have remembered the locations of water
across the vast deserts in which they venture. These
secrets are ﬁercely guarded, as the tribes’ life depends
upon them. These places are sometimes nothing more
than a hole in a rocky stretch of ground in which water
can be plumbed. Other times, a camp might form around
a sprawling oasis where date palms, vegetation, and
animals live and water is abundant. When crossing a

Settlements

• 23

desert, or hiding in one, nomads move from one water
source to another, never staying in one place for more
than a few days, so as to keep the locations secret.
While the Dahae are encamped, a few nomad warriors
are always on guard. Typically they venture into the
desert, away from the camp, to sound a warning should
anyone approach. Whenever possible, the guards hide
and surprise wanders, bringing back the intruders as
captives for ransom, use as slaves, or sale into bondage
at the next city. Should heroes ﬁnd themselves in this
predicament, only the clever use of bluﬀ or persuasion
skills against the leader’s mettle can extradite them.
If the heroes can possibly befriend Mukhtar through
a successful interaction attempt, his trust his gained,
at least enough to let them go.

The
Secrets of
the Dahae
One of the obvious
secrets the nomad
tribe possesses is the
locations of watering holes in the deserts in which they
dwell. As this is tribal
information, handed
down generation by
generation, learning
of it requires that the
heroes join the tribe.

This is not an easy task, as the players’ characters are
likely to be considered outsiders. To be accepted by
the Dahae, a ﬁtting task of bravery and proﬁt must be
performed — one that’s appropriately diﬃcult and dangerous. The trust of the Dahae is not earned easily.
Another secret known by Mukhtar and several of his
closest lieutenants is the location of a necropolis. This
“city of the dead” is cut into a massif in a mountain range
bordering a desert. There’s no map, as the knowledge
has been handed down through the generations. It’s
both a revered and feared place, naturally rumored to
be ﬁlled with treasure. No Dahae leader has successfully penetrated the massif and returned to tell of what
lies inside. Mukhtar wants to be the ﬁrst. If the heroes
show great prowess, he’s likely to suggest they enter
the necropolis as proof of their worthiness, thereby
gaining entry into the tribe.

The Hut of
Morcades
the Witch

Standing in the depths of an ancient, gnarled forest
is the hut of Morcades. Shunned and loathed by most
folks, Morcades has lived her solitary life practicing

24
the black arts, only visited by those who willingly risk
the dangers of bargaining with her.
Upon ﬁrst sight, Morcades’s hut appears to be nothing more than a circular structure of woven saplings
and mud with a thatch roof. The shelter gives the
appearance of being untended and dilapidated. Those
who gaze upon it must roll their mettle skill against a
diﬃculty of 17. A failure results in a forlorn and foreboding feeling, accompanied by an urge to leave. All who
experience this sensation will not approach the hut.
Instead, they back away until the hut is out of sight.
The eerie feeling goes away after about 10 minutes.
Should they wish, they may try visiting again (with
the same potential problem)
The interior of the hut is cluttered, piled with earthen
pots and jars, each ﬁlled with strange dried plants or
noxious smelling liquids. Hanging from cords tied to
the ceiling are bundles of dried herbs and desiccated
animals. Heroes who make a Moderate search attempt
also spot a variety of humanoid skulls stuﬀed in corners
and partially covered by the debris.

purchased in villages or cities. Morcades does have a
fondness for beautiful dresses — even though she never
has the opportunity to wear one in public.
In disguise, she occasionally ventures into settlements to make purchases. But on the whole, she prefers
to stay clear of such places to avoid an unpleasant
demise.
Heroes in need of the witch’s services must successfully bargain with her. The diﬃculty depends upon what
is requested and the method of request. Some days
she response better to a simple plea than to ﬂattery.
Potions tend to be easier to acquire, when she has them,
though brewing is always a timely venture. Removing
curses or reading fortunes is more costly.

Halwyndale,
Burrow Village

Embraced by the Ahern foothills of the Phelan Mountains is the Gnomish hillside warren of Halwyndale. For
many generations Gnomes have occupied this peaceful
settlement, going about their lives, ignoring the strife
or the nearby Dwarves, Elves, and Humans. By far, the
community is agrarian, with animals prowling the wide
dirt roads that lead from one burrow and farm to the
next. But, being creative, the Gnome warren is rich
with unusual devices and contraptions — all of which
are sure to attract the attention of any visitors.

The Ahern
Foothills
The gentle rises and soft curves of the foothills are
deceiving. During the daylight hours, the hills are safe
and a favored location for collecting sour roots for cooking and brewing. But at night, none of the denizens of
Halwyndale venture beyond their village boundaries.
Sprinkled about the land are many caverns that reach

One of the settlement’s
most respected citizens is
Betha Etain. Her popularity is so high in the warren
that she has been elected
mayor for the last 20 years
— a command of oﬃce no
other citizen in the history
of Halwyndale has ever
achieved. Protective of her
warren, she seeks out and
personally greets all who enter the tiny habitation. She
is an excellent judge of character, and upon a “nod,”
visitors are welcome to stay. But a “harrumph” causes
the inhabitants of the warren to chase the unwanted
guests away.
Winning Betha’s favor requires successful charm roll
against Betha’s mettle. Of course, a bit of ﬂattery and
a handful of sincere compliments on the beauty of the
warren earn heroes a +1D bonus to rolls.

Cachamwri Cabry’s Inn
This is the only place in Halwyndale that’s built to
accommodate “tall folk,” although this claim is debat-

able. Cachamwri’s burrow has high ceilings (almost
1. 5 meters) and wide hallways and rooms. While
conﬁning for most humanoids, it’s better suited than
any other residence in the warren. However, the inn
can serve only ﬁve Human-sized occupants in a single
night. The innkeeper charges more for folk who are
tall, as they reduce the number of customers he can
have. Furthermore, customers who cannot pronounce
Cachamwri’s name properly (it’s “kak-am-ree”) soon
earn his ire. This is likely to make him moody and
increase his prices.
In the front of the inn is a cramped tavern. Humans
and all others of similar dimension are expected to sit
around the ﬁreplace. There are “tall folk” chairs but no
matching tables.

Heroes who stay at Cachamwri’s soon encounter
Betha, who is there to “set her mind about them.” If
they’re welcomed, then any Gnome customers present
quickly sidle over to the characters, looking for news
and tales of distant lands. Any of the players’ characters
who decide to indulge the locals with tales quickly ﬁnd
themselves interrupted, and on the listening end of a

If the characters hear this tale and oﬀer their assistance,
they certainly gain the favor of the entire village — once they
succeed, of course.
The exquisite weapon is a long sword, with a engraved hilt
depicting a beautiful woman singing with a lute. Its deadliness
is based upon the wielder’s skill. A hero with a melee combat
skill of 4D or less causes the unsheathed blade to emit a
high-pitched whistle that can distract an opponent who fails

solid objects. Anything composed of stone, glass, wood, or
ﬂesh within the two-meter area of eﬀect suﬀers 2D+2 damage. Each ability may only be used once per day, and the hero
must have the appropriate skill level to use them. The wielder
is not aﬀected by any of the sword’s abilities.

Viking
Village

The Vikings are both farmers and
raiders. They tend to live in agricultural settlements, raising crops
and livestock. Quite often, these
settlements are near the coast, as the
Vikings are shipmakers and travelers.
Because the Vikings venture to many
diﬀerent lands, others often assimilate their customs and cultures, just
as the Vikings adapt foreign folkways
and technologies.
A Viking village is comprised of a
variety of structures, including private
houses, blacksmiths’ shops, leatherworkers, carpenters, and a great
feasting hall. The feasting hall serves
as the focus of a Viking settlement.
This is where celebrations take place

Settlements

• 27

and where the thane, or king, awards gifts to those who
served him, typically in combat.
The construction techniques vary from area to area,
but perhaps the most common is a structure with wood
walls and a thatch roof. Sometimes mud was used to ﬁll
the cracks in walls and around doorways. The feasting
hall usually towers over the surrounding buildings,
well tended and lavish in comparison.
Often a palisade and a gate defends the village.
Although houses and farms exist outside the palisade, the residents retreat inside the protective walls
when there’s trouble. The Vikings are a rugged people,
accustomed to hardship and war, so when inhabitants
of a village gather behind the walls, the threat is usually great.
At one village in particular, the heros notice that the
gates are locked and warriors stand at the ready. Unless
the characters are from this village or a friendly village,
they must convince the edgy inhabitants that they mean
no harm. An opposed roll of a character’s bluﬀ, charm,
or persuasion against the guards’ and the thane’s mettle
is required. Vikings are extremely superstitious. If any
of the players’ characters attempt to use magic openly,
the warriors and the thane receive a +10 to their mettle
totals in all further negotiations.
Once inside the village, the heroes quickly learn of
the fear of attack by a mysterious monster that ventures
out each night the moon is high. Although all eﬀorts
have been made to defend the village and its people, the creature
manages to enter unseen and
steal away a victim. If the heroes
oﬀer to assist, then the thane
promises a considerable reward
for slaying the monster.

The Monster
Perhaps playing oﬀ the epic tale Beowulf might be
entertaining, particularly if the players are unaware
of the story. Other ideas from D6 Fantasy Creatures
include a werewolf, a European Vampire, or ghost
warrior. Whatever the type of creature used, it should
be fearsome and challenging enough to give Vikings
second thoughts.

Thalas,
Greek City

The Greeks of the Hellenistic period are phenomenal
builders. While their structures do not rival the works
of the Egyptians in size, they compensate for this with
quality of craft. This city is an example of the amazing
craftsmanship and beauty at the time, a glorious city
where the sights are as amazing as the events. Like
other prominent Greek cities of the era, stone walls
surround it. These ﬂank the passage from the center
of the city to the wharves. This allows the residents to
have access to the sea even when under siege.
In times of peace, farms are scattered outside the
perimeter of the city walls. (In times of war, the ﬁelds
ﬁll with the tents of armies.) But once the characters
enter the city, they need to make a Moderate mettle
roll to avoid being enraptured by the spectacles. Those
who fail are struck by the sights and spend 1D minutes
looking, pointing and talking about what they see.
The Acropolis: This is one of the oldest structures
in the city. Erected upon a summit, it once served as a

• Chapter One

citadel. Under the guidance of the city’s ruler, Sofronius,
the summit was cleared, and new structures were built.
The Propylaia and several temples are now located upon
the site of the Acropolis. From the lower portions of
the city, these buildings are all visible.
The Propylaia: Leading from the city proper are a
series of stairs climbing to the gateway. The gateway
has four entrances as well, each leading to a diﬀerent location, including temples; a place displaying
paintings, friezes, and statues of gods and heroes,
and an unﬁnished structure. Lining the stone stairs
are statues of marble and bronze. Tremendous Doric
columns support roofs of the massive constructions.
Upon entering the Propylaia, it’s clear that only the
temple is completed. Visitors are not allowed in the
unﬁnished areas.
The Temple: Rectangular in shape, this is the city’s
newest temple for its patron goddess. By Greek standards, the design is simplistic. However, no mortar
was used with the stone. Every block is ﬁnely aligned,
creating what appears to be a perfect building. In the
ceiling are a series of friezes (metopes) depicting the
Greek struggle against “savagery.” At the far end towers
a statue, a marvel of craftsmanship and
Greek technology.
The Academy: This school was established to teach philosophy. To the ancient
Greeks, philosophy is the application of
the mind to understand humanity, nature,
and the world. There are many branches
of philosophy taught at the Academy,
and the work is rigorous. The Academy
also trains orators who serve as members
of the Assembly or as lawyers. Players’
characters who spend at least a year at
the Academy earn +2D to their scholar
skill for no additional Character Point
expenditure.
If any signiﬁcant amount of time is
spent at the Academy, students soon hear
rumors about an invisible thief who has
been prowling through the city stealing
from the homes. Sofronius is troubled by
this, believing it a bad omen. He is relying
upon the council of the Academy masters
to help him ﬁnd the thief.
The Market: Like all Greek cities,
there’s an open air market here. Each day,
a variety of food, necessities, and imported
luxuries are displayed by merchants.
Typically, a moderately wealthy Greek

household sends a male slave to makes purchases from

Utsmuul,
Maya City

The Maya live in metropolises located in the verdant
jungles of South America. They developed original
architectural designs and technologies used in the construction of their cities. They also incorporate religion,
philosophy, and culture in city layout and building
design, making many Maya settlements more than
trading posts and gathering spots; these places serve
as spiritual centers and focal points for government.
The majority of ediﬁces in a city such as Tikal or
Copan are built from large stones, carefully crafted and
set into place. The Maya build large pyramids, which
serve as temples. Every major city has at least one
stepped-pyramid, plus a variety of palaces, shrines, ball
courts, and plazas. Standing in some of these locations
are stelae, large stones (two to four meters tall) with
carved writing and images. To the Maya, the stelae are
works of art that tell stories, identify locations, and
recount history.
Clustered around the periphery of the city are the
stone and mud-brick houses of the farmers, craftspeople, and laborers. Besides being places to eat and

sleep, the dwellings also serve as burial sites. Occupants,
when they die, are entombed beneath their former
residences.
Many Maya settlements are city-states. A king, who
also serves as the lawmaker, independently rules a city,
though the priests have signiﬁcant sway over events.
The king participated in many divine rituals, including
bloodletting ceremonies. The priests, however, were the
only ones with the knowledge to interpret the stars
and the complex calendar and determine the proper
times for rituals.

The Temples
The heart of Maya life is its religion, and the heart
of its religion is the temples. Ceremonies and celebrations are performed at them. They are constructed
of a series of concentric square levels rising to a ceremonial chamber. Glyphs are carved into the walls of
their chambers, recounting Maya religious and other
signiﬁcant events. The largest temple in the city has a
sealed door set into the ﬂoor of uppermost chamber.
This serves as the entrance to the lower levels of the
central pyramid, the location where kings and royalty
are buried. Characters who manage to enter the sacred
upper chamber of the temple can use search to notice
a door. (The diﬃculty is Moderate.)
Opening the door requires pry bars or similar tools,
as the door is held in place by a series of eight stone
pillars that have been cut away to remain ﬂush with
the surface. With the proper tools, a player’s character

30

can use the lifting skill to pry out the stone pinions.
(The diﬃculty is Very Diﬃcult, and they have a Toughness of 6D.)
Once open, a stairwell is visible. It descends several
hundred meters into the pyramid, extending into a
subterranean set of three to ﬁve rooms. Stone doors
connect the rooms, each locked with stone pinions.
Knocking down the doors requires rams or similar
devices (their Toughness is 6D). Heroes can attempt
to pry free the stone pinions; this has a diﬃculty of
Diﬃcult.
While there’s always great treasure buried with
Maya kings, there could be a curse as well. Treasure
seekers who barge through these ancient tombs might
release a creature long forgotten by humanity — and
very dangerous.

The Ballcourt
The Maya enjoy the thrill of deadly competition.
Nearly every major city has a ballcourt, some of which
were over 180 meters in length and 75 meters in
width. At each end of the court stands an angled wall
or (preferably) temple that reﬂects sound with eerie
ability. Without the sounds of the crowds or the players, heroes standing at one end of the ﬁeld can hear
whispers uttered from the other.
Sitting upon a throne set high over the ﬁeld, the king
presides over the games, the object of which is to get
touch round disks set several meters above the ground
or pass the ball through a ring set at right angles to
the ground. The players may only touch the ball, which

• Chapter One

weighs about one kilogram and measures
just under half a meter
in diameter, with their
hips, knees, or elbows.
Generally, the first
team to score wins the
game.
At the end of a game,
the leader of the losing temple is expected
to oﬀer his head for
decapitation to the
captain of the winning
team. Those unfamiliar with this practice
or who have strong,
opposing moral or religious views roll their
mettle skill to restrain
themselves from interfering. The gamemaster determines the diﬃculty based on the character’s views of
morality, religious beliefs, and who’s participating in
the contest.
Any who attempt to interrupt the ending ceremonies
are likely to ﬁnd themselves facing decapitation as well.
The games of the Maya are both entertaining and sacred.
The captains who lose believe that oﬀering their heads
delivers them to the afterworld all the quicker — they
don’t consider it as punishment.

Sala Colonia,
Roman African
Colony

In the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana
stands the city of Sala Colonia. It’s one of the many
territories the rampaging Roman Empire seized from
Carthage. Sala Colonia is situated on the Atlantic
coast, not far from the Straits of Gibraltar, and serves
as a port city. The access to the ocean allows merchant
ships to bring cargo from distant lands to the thriving
province.
The Romans are masters of stone and architecture.
Even when located on another continent, far from
Rome, the artisans and workers cut and craft astonishing stone structures. Unlike many other cities of rivaling
nations, those of the Romans are elaborate, convenient
and well organized. As with Sala Colonia, this tend to
attract many thousands of inhabitants.

Settlements

• 31

While there are many provinces within the domain
of the Roman Empire, there’s essentially one system
of government. Early in Rome’s history, it transformed
from a republic to an imperial state, ruled by an emperor,
or “caesar.” Two consuls, who ruled equally with the aid
of tribunes and a senate, formally held this position.
When Rome became an imperial state, it retained the
Senate, but all authority rested upon the emperor.
From him, authority ﬂowed to the pro-consuls, rulers
of the provinces. Within each province were prefects,
who ruled individual cities. But all bowed to the word
of the emperor.

The City
Many Romans, native or conquered, preferred
to live within the boundaries of a city. Fresh water,
markets, baths, craftsmen, and protection are a few
of the advantages not found in rural life. To provide
ample living space for these vast numbers of people,
engineers developed the insulae. This is a multi-family
apartment that commonly sported a therme (hot
bath), courtyard, and fountains (which also served
as a source of water). These buildings often served
as inns as well. For the wealthier Romans, there
are private villas. These two-story structures have
all of the accoutrements of an insuale, except for
the nearby neighbors. Privacy and plush living
conditions are the marks of a successful Roman
citizen.
The Forum: This public meeting place is popular
among the denizens of Sala Colonia. The Forum is
a gathering spot to share gossip and news and to
discuss politics. It also serves as the seat of local
government. Here politicians orate to the people.
The Forums are so popular that many roads bear
signs indicating the distance to the next Forum.
The Marketplace: Sala Colonia has a spectacular marketplace, even by Roman standards. Besides
the typical street vendors selling everything from
cloth to jewelry, there are taverns and bakeries surrounding the location. People visiting the market
can readily step into a tavern for a drink or visit a
bakery for a snack.
The Amphitheater: Almost as essential to the
city as the Forum is the Roman amphitheater. These
structures vary from city to city, but in most cases
they’re arenas of entertainment. With stadium
seating, the amphitheater of Sala Colonia can hold
over 1,000 spectators. The amusements vary from
the display of wild animals, executions, gladiatorial games, and naval battles (the amphitheater

is sometimes ﬁlled with water and small craft used to
recreate conﬂicts). Additionally, the amphitheater is
used as a means of “taming” the population, thereby
avoiding riots by keeping citizens preoccupied.
The gladiatorial games are always a popular sport,
and often proﬁtable. Characters can enter these deadly
contests with a minimal cost (Very Easy price diﬃculty
or one silver coin). The chance of proﬁt is great — for
those who survive. Gladiators can enter such events
as chariot racing or one-on-one armed combat (man
against man, or man against beast). Battle royales are
also popular in the amphitheater. Such entertainment
involves 10 to 20 contestants who ﬁght until only one
gladiator remains standing.

Settlement
Defenses
Regardless if a village, town, or city is one of
many within a kingdom or a self-governed, independent city-state, some form of defenses are usually
required. Invading barbarians, bands of brigands,
invading armies, or other threats necessitate that
a settlement have some form of protection. For
hamlets and warrens, this might be nothing more
than a small volunteer militia. It’s unlikely anything
more than a handful of local inhabitants exist to
defend the site, and in these cases, they’re probably
poorly trained and armed. With larger villages and
towns, wooden palisades or stonewalls might serve
as a defense or aid a small military force. Large cities
are likely to be surrounded by walls, with a sizable
force of men-at-arms assisting in the city’s protection. Towers, city gates, and war machines are all
likely components of large city’s defenses.
Gamemasters designing settlements need to
consider their means of protection. The greater the
wealth of a city, the better its defenses. Likewise,
if a habitation exists at a strategically signiﬁcant
location within a kingdom, the presence of a welltrained garrison of soldiers is a likely defense that’s
funded by the country’s ruler.

Design

Designing a settlement for many gamemasters is one
of the most important aspects of a setting, while others
avoid the task whenever possible. Because players are
free willed, they often venture into unknown territory,
forcing on-the-spot creations of lackluster locations.
By using the Settlement Design Sheet, a gamemaster
can quickly construct the skeleton of a village or city,
without having to worry over the details. Of course,
it can later be revisited and elaborated upon, adding
vibrancy to a location.
All of the locations within this chapter can be used in
whole or part when developing settings. If a village or
a library is quickly needed, then simply use one that’s
provided. Another option is to take portions from the
chapter and ﬁt them together. Or simply start from
scratch. In all cases, by using the Settlement Design

with minimal eﬀort.

Castles and
Fortresses
This friend has done an extensive study
of castles and fortresses, the common features of which he’s summed in this chapter.
He’s also included a few examples of people
and places that he discovered in his quest for
the perfect castle.

Brief History

Throughout time, people have worked
together for mutual strength and support. A
group is much stronger than an individual, and
objectives tend to be met much faster. Perhaps
the best expression of this mentality is the
tenacity of a group defending their mutual
home. This home may be nothing more than a
hole in a mountain or a hillside, but as cultures
have evolved, so have their building techniques.
The homes these people fought to defend became
castles and fortresses.
As cultures grew and developed, many
common attributes appeared in their designs.
Perimeter walls are among the most common
of these. Every freestanding fortiﬁcation
has some sort of palisade or stonework
wall surrounding it. Likewise, moats,
ponds, ditches, and culverts are also quite
common. These are all used to delay
the attackers from reaching the castle
walls or in some cases to prevent
them from reaching certain areas all
together. The most common and
unifying factor in the design of
a castle, however, is that
each one is designed
and built to be a place
of safety and refuge.

As an army invades a territory, its leaders may choose
to quickly build small motte and bailey-style castles.
These castles provide a foothold in the territory they
have seized. They also provide a fallback location in
case the invasion turns sour. These simple castles can
also be used as a staging ground for more elaborate
castles to be built.
From the other side, a large castle with stonework
wall 10 meters tall would give even the most seasoned
ﬁeld commander second thoughts about laying siege.
The people living in such a structure would also have a
great deal of advantage over an attacking army. After all,
it doesn’t take a trained soldier to stand on a wall and
drop large rocks or pour boiling oil onto attackers.

Location

The foremost consideration to building a castle is
location. The ground should be solid and stable, not
overly wet — swamps are deﬁnitely not a good place
to start. There should be a ready supply of water, such
as a spring or a well. (Some riverside castles include in
their design some means of getting water from the river
that can’t be blocked by a besieging army.) Resources
at hand also allow for ease of building. Mines or quarries speed the building as the stones don’t have to be
transported a great distance. The same can be said for
the ore to be forged or smelted into metal. A castle
placed at a strategic crossroads or port can easily be
used to police the traﬃc in that area and maintain
contact with distant regions of the kingdom.
Castles are generally built on the high ground, making
them easier to defend. In some places, high ground is not
available, so the builder ﬁxes the problem by moving a
lot of earth. These artiﬁcial hills can be relatively steep
but they don’t have to be. A very steep hill allows for
easier defense, as the attacker has to climb the steep
bank. Attacking while having to worry about keeping

Lord Urdane, Baron of the
Northlands

Lord Urdane is the typical land-grubbing
baron. He quite literally bought his title from
King Thuslund of Oktonia, who was busy
ﬁghting a war with his neighbors. Urdane
is a man who wants nothing more than to
acquire wealth and show it oﬀ to his peers.
Everyone from peasants to other lords dislikes him for his greed. Nonetheless, their
disdain of his character doesn’t overcome
the fact that he is one of the most powerful
lords in the land. He has the funding to make
what he says go.

His Castle
Lord Urdane’s castle was completed
two seasons ago, though portions of it
were being lived in long before it was
completed. The perimeter of the castle has
a wall two stories high with a drawbridge,
a gatehouse, and stonework crenels, merlons, and arrow loops. A moat surrounds
it. The inner wall is also two stories high,
with stonework hording and a tower in
each of its corners and a gatehouse oﬀset
from the exterior wall’s gate. The towers
are three stories high. Both gatehouses
include murderholes, arrow loops, and
trapdoors.
The buildings on the inside include two
barracks, a great hall, servant and guest
housing, a kitchen, a smithy, stables, and
other, small craft buildings. All the buildings aside from the smithy and the stables
have ﬂooring. The housing, barracks, and
kitchen have wooden ﬂoors, while the great
hall has a stonework ﬂoor.
All the structures aside from the great
hall, kitchen, and extra housing have
thatch roofs. Those three buildings have
lead sheet roofs. The great hall also sports
numerous narrow glass windows.

38
your balance and footing is
very complicated.
Artificial hills, however,
provide some distinct engineering problems. Packed
earth from a natural hill is
dense and can have many
tons of stonework placed
on it. Usually this requires
some foundation work but
not always. Artiﬁcial hills are
not densely packed enough to
allow for most stonework to
stand on them no matter how
much of a foundation is built.
As more stonework is added
to the top of an artiﬁcial hill,
the chance of the earthwork
collapsing increases. This collapse is very sudden and usually happens without warning.
Very few people working on
the site and in the area where
the earthen pile will slide are
likely to survive.
Another consideration is the people who will be
building it. Anyone can dig a ditch or carry earth, but
not just anyone can work stone or forge iron. Having
a good work crew is best. The more people the builder
can have on a job, the quicker they can do a job. Likewise, poor management can also lead to a great deal
of problems and delays.

Parts of a
Castle
Hills
Hills are a necessary part of a castle, though larger
castles need natural hills as artiﬁcial hills cannot always
support the weight of a large stonework fortiﬁcation.
Along with building hills up, sometimes earth has to be
moved to make way for certain parts of a castle. If a suitable hill is found but it has an uneven section, the uneven
area will have to be dug away. The sheep’s foot method
(see the sidebar) is used quite extensively to pack down
the earth, but it has its problems: If the earth is too wet
or too dry (which is sometimes diﬃcult to ascertain), it
doesn’t compact well, possibly causing structure shifting
or even disintegration of the mound later.

• Chapter Two

Walls
The next part of any fortiﬁcation is a wall around
the perimeter. The outside walls’ primary purpose is
defense against invaders. The wall can also be used to
control the entrance and exits of an area. This control
can be for protection or for taxation. For example,
merchants carrying goods to market may be forced to
pay a toll or tax before entering the market.
The wall can be built from many diﬀerent resources,
depending on what’s available, how much time there is to
erect the wall, and what type of invaders are expected.
The ﬁrst walls were made from piles of earth. The
main problem with this earthen pile was that defenders
only stood on top of the wall. If the attackers had large
numbers, they could simply overwhelm the defenders
on the wall by rushing past them.
Another early version of the wall was made by simply
digging a ditch and standing trees side by side in the ditch.
The ditch was then ﬁlled in. The wall height could be
adjusted by how much of the tree was left above ground.
This wall worked well, for the most part, but if the wall
was too short, then the attackers could simply jump over
it. However, if the wall was too tall, then the defenders
could not see their attackers to ﬁre on them.

Trenches and
Bridges
A castle built on high ground is in a very defendable position but a little more defense always helps. A
trench dug around the perimeter requires the attackers
to slow down as they come up the trench toward the
wall. If the trench is deep enough, it would require the
attackers to bridge it.
Filling the trench with some kind of liquid turns a
ditch into a moat with little eﬀort. Most of the time,
rainwater keeps the moat full. In the event of a drought,
diverting a nearby river or stream could maintain the
water level. Should that tactic fail or not be an option,
the ground stays soggy for some time, adding +2 or
more to movement diﬃculties for several days or weeks,
depending on how severe the drought is.
Spanning techniques are pretty much the same and
have not changed since the ﬁrst foot bridge was built.
Readily made from any trees or wood in the area, the
sides of a bridge are reinforced so it will bear the weight
of soldiers as they cross it. The attackers carry the
bridge up to the moat and drop it across to the castle
allowing them to attack.
A moat or trenching network requires some way
for the defenders and people who live in the castle on
a daily basis to enter and exit. A permanent bridge is
the simplest solution, but it needs to be defendable. A
heavy gate it one way to do this, while a movable bridge
is another.
A drawbridge is hinged at
the base of the gatehouse,
and a pulley system raises
the bridge. In the basic
version, gravity lowers the
bridge quickly, but it takes
a great deal of work to pull
the structure up. Adding
a large counter-weight on
one end, with a support in
the middle, can solve the
raising problem. Braces
under the weighted end
are pulled or knocked out
when attackers threaten.
This causes the bridge to
snap up quickly. The enemy
can try to grab onto the end
near them and pull it down,
but doing so draws ﬁre from
the defenders.

Weaponry
Many weapons can be used as a defensive or oﬀensive
weapon. Swords and other bladed weapons lack the
range to be able to attack foes more than two meters
away. Bows and crossbows are quite obvious choices
to for combat at a distance. A well trained soldier with
a long bow can be deadly at 250 meters and a heavy
crossbow at 300 meters.
Siege weapons are also as useful tool for the defending army as they’re for the attacking army. Catapults,
ballistas, trebuchets, and cannons (if available) are easy
to use and can be devastating to an army.
Catapults are wood and rope devices that use tension to ﬁre a projectile at the enemy. The upright of the
catapult is pulled back with either rope on an axle or
a block and tackle. The upright can either be a single
piece of wood or many diﬀerent pieces of wood banded
together. Drawing back the upright stores a great deal
of energy into the device. As the rope is cut or set loose
the upright springs back to its original shape, propelling
the projectile forward. The larger the upright, the more
force is required to draw it back, but the projectiles get
tossed greater distances. As there’s an upper limit to this
design, other types of siege engines using comparative
principles were created.
Trebuchets are similar to catapults but they use a
large counter-weight to ﬁre the projectile, instead of
tension in the weapon. A long wooden beam serves as
the throwing arm. A basket or platform is on the long

Melee Combat Weapon

Note: All weapons listed on this table receive a +5 to their combat diﬃculties due to their unwieldiness. Gamemasters may have the weapons do damage on subsequent rounds because of rolling or splashing. On a failure with a
1 on the Wild Die, the weapon misﬁres and injures its crew.
1. For ammunition that can be set on ﬁre, add +1D to the initial damage and inﬂict 3D damage each round thereafter
until it’s cleaned oﬀ. Incendiary ammunition costs two gold (Easy price diﬃculty).
2. This is the number of rounds it takes to reload or reset the weapon.
3. This suggested scale for when the item is not mounted on a vehicle.
4. Price does not include ammunition or (in the case of cannons) ﬁring powder. Price of ammunition varies, depending on how much work went into shaping it; use two coppers (Very Easy price diﬃculty) for a quarried and unshaped
stone as the average.
5. The minimum Short Range is 30 meters. This weapon does not have a Point Blank range.
6. As these items are dropped, not thrown, they do not have a range. A cauldron or bucket can injure one target. For
every pot’s or bucket’s worth poured in the same area, increase the number of targets by 1 (this does not also increase
damage). Make one attack roll for all targets. Cauldrons designed to pour on several people need a crew of three to tip
and a lot of time for the oil or tar to warm up. Example: One basic pot of oil can hurt one person for 4D. A cauldron
twice that size can injure two people for 4D each with one attack roll. Two basic pots can harm two people for 4D each,
but two attack rolls are necessary.
7. May only be used at Point Blank range.

end while a heavy weight is set on the short
end. The long end of the arm is drawn down
to the ground, raising the weight into the
air. When the arm is released, the weight
falls and swings the arm into the air. The
larger the trebuchet the larger the counterweight can be. The larger the weight, the
heavier and farther the weapon can ﬂing
objects. The maximum size of the trebuchet
depends entirely on whether the basket can
be pulled down.
Catapults and trebuchets are not precise
weapons, as projectile shape, wind, temperature, and humidity can greatly aﬀect
the ﬂight characteristics of the projectile.
Therefore, the projectiles are made in such
a way as to have a better eﬀect on impact.
A round or semi-round projectile will skip
and roll along the ground. If it lands in
front of a unit, it can very well bounce
its way through an entire section, at least
breaking the formation and inﬂicting a large
number of rather brutal injuries. Larger
trebuchet and catapults can also ﬁre huge
square sections of stonework. These shaped
rocks tumble and roll depending on the
ground they land on. If the ground’s soft,
the block sticks when it lands, but if the
ground’s hard, it rolls. Throwing incendiary devices is also quite common, as they
can set ﬁre to the ground and anything
around the area around where they land.
Pots of burning oil are the most popular
incendiary projectile, but the only limit’s
the user’s imagination.
Ballistas are monstrous versions of the
catapult; some have a cross member more
than three meters in length. These weapons
act exactly like a crossbow, only on a much
larger scale, including ﬁring bolts or spears.
A few ﬂing out stones.
To ﬁre an incendiary device, a pottery
container ﬁlled with oil is attached to a spear
before ﬁring. This prevents the pot from
breaking on the weapon and dispersing its
ﬁery contents on the people using it.
A cannon is a metal tube with one closed
end and one open end. The cannon is loaded
with black powder and shot. Powder is then
poured down a hole (drilled near the closed
end of the tube) and touched oﬀ with a light
fuse. The powder explodes and propels the

Putting Out the
Fire
Gamemasters simply can increase the damage of weapons
set on ﬁre, or they can use these optional guidelines to add
depth to ﬁery eﬀects.
Should the damage total be less than the damage resistance total, the ﬁre either goes out or rolls oﬀ the target’s
armor or natural protection.
Any time the damage exceeds the resistance total, the
target’s set on ﬁre and continues to burn until the ﬂames
get put out. After the ﬁrst round, the ﬁre does 3D damage
— but be sure to check the Wild Die. If the Wild Die shows
a 6, the ﬁre intensiﬁes by +1D on the next round. If the
Wild Die comes up a 1, the ﬁre dies down by 1D.
Characters can extinguish the ﬁre by immediately
immersing themselves in water. Alternatively, they can
attempt to smother the ﬁre either with a heavy blanket or
by rolling on the ground. In either case, putting out the ﬁre
takes two full rounds in which the character may do nothing
else. The continue to incur damage for those rounds, but
the end of the second round, they’re extinguished. They’re
still susceptible to being reignited if incendiary weapons
redouse them. Characters can also continue to ﬁght and
hope luck puts them out.
Example: Sigmund, Skinny Peter, and Worthington the
Priest are storming a gatehouse. Sammy pours burning
pitch down on them from his position on the wall. As it’s a
Sammy rolls damage for the group (2, 3, 5, and 5 on the Wild
Die). Sigmund, Skinny, and Worthington take 15 points of
damage. Unfortunately, their armor doesn’t absorb all of it,
so they’re on ﬁre. In the next round, Skinny’s player rolls
eight points of damage, with a one on the Wild Die; the
next round, he will roll 4D damage. Skinny abandons his
friends and leaps from the gatehouse into the moat, putting himself out after two turns of washing oﬀ. Sigmund’s
player is luckier; he doesn’t roll any value on the Wild Die.
His character drops to the ground in an attempt to put
himself out (it’ll take two rounds). Worthington continues
to attack the door. His player rolls 3D to determine damage
from the ﬁre and rolls a six on the Wild Die. Next round,
the ﬁre will have died down by 1D, causing it to do only
2D of damage.

Minor Castle in
the Northlands
Urdane must play host to a knight whom he despises, though
he can’t kill him outright due to his family’s social status. Thufer
the Pious is a kind and gentle man who wants no one to suﬀer
and is liked by everyone from the peasants who serve him to
King Thuslund, who sent him to Urdane’s lands to keep tabs
on Urdane. The king would like to get back Urdane’s land, and
if he learned enough of Urdane’s secrets, then he would have
him ousted. Thufer would probably be the one to take over
the barony. In an attempt to get Thufer out of his lands and
this world, Urdane sent Thufer to guard a small castle on the
border to the orc lands. Fighting is common there, and if the
orcs kill Thufer, then Urdane can tell the king that Thufer died
honorable in the service of his lord.
The minor castle has a two walls, the exterior one of wood
and an interior one of stone. There’s stonework hoarding on
the inner one, for the protection of the defenders using it.
Though the exterior wall only sports a gate, the interior wall
has a gatehouse complete with murder holes, arrow loops,
three-meter-tall doors, and a portcullis. Two wells inside of
the inner walls provide water for the residents. The barracks
and the small hall (with kitchen) have metal roofs and stone
walls. The stable and smithy are wooden structures, and other,
temporary wooden buildings are erected as needed.

above can break bones or crush a
skull. Boiling water, oil, or pitch
poured onto enemies can scald
them. Oil and pitch also have the
distinct advantage of being quite
ﬂammable. If the boiling liquid
isn’t enough, once it’s set on ﬁre,
it will cause most attackers to at
least reconsider their route into
the castle.

Towers

Towers allow defenders to see
the country around them and
keep watch over people in the
castle courtyard. Some watchtowers consist simply of a wooden
platform with no roof, while
others are cut stone like the rest
of the castle.
They are generally a level or two
higher than the exterior walls, but
they’re not necessarily taller than
the main structure. This added
height allows for a better view of
the local terrain. Another advantage of a tower is that dropped

Gatehouses
A castle with four solid walls is not much use without
entrances or exits. Assuming that the residents don’t
ﬂy or have a magical means of getting in, having one
very large opening in the wall would allow attackers to
breech the fortiﬁcation without little eﬀort. Including
a gatehouse enables a large entrance to be easily protected. A gatehouse is basically a sizable tower with a
large opening that can be closed oﬀ by heavy doors.
Gatehouses are built into the walls, usually in the
center. The centered placement is not a requirement
but it can have strategic importance. If it’s too close to
a corner tower, the attacker could focus on that corner
and capture the corner tower and the gatehouse. If the
gap between the corner towers and the gatehouses is
equidistant, then the defenders would have a better
chance at defending all three structures.
The gatehouse is built in the same way as a tower. The
entrances to the gatehouse tower are on the inside of
the castle to keep invaders from gaining access to the
defensive parts of gatehouse. It’s quite important that
the gatehouse has a hoarding, machicoulis, or breteche
over the main opening.
The primary means of entrance and exit to most
castles is through a large set of doors on either end of
a wide hallway that runs through the gatehouse. These
doors generally are made out of heavy wooden planks
and banded together
inside and out with iron
straps. Outer and inner
doors are used to keep
attackers from simply
having to breech one set
of doors to gain entrance
to the courtyard.
These doors are quite
large and heavy. They
can be set on a counterbalance so that even the
smallest child can open
and close them. The
doors are pinned open
and, when they need to
be closed in a hurry, the
pins are removed and
the doors close quickly.
(The setup of the balance
determines how quickly
this happens.) In the
event of an attack, the
doors can be closed and

the counter-balance system broken so the doors were
much harder to move. The doors are then barred with a
large wooden plank and braced with whatever is handy.
(This can add +1D or more to the door’s Toughness.)
The attacker generally will try to force the doors down
by whatever means necessary. Though a battering ram
is the most obvious means of forced entry, the rocks
and ﬁre dropped by the defenders from the machicoulis
above the doors could prove this a costly maneuver.
A portcullis is another choice for barring the way.
This is a large grid made of thick wood and/or iron. The
openings in the grate are generally no more than ﬁve
centimeters across. This allows for the defenders to
thrust spears and ﬁre arrows and bolts through without
the danger of the smallest attacker getting past.
The portcullis is kept in the raised position. A large
wheel and axle system is used to move it. With more
than one person operating the system, it can be lowered
slowly, but a single person can throw the release and
slam down the portcullis. Some large fortiﬁcations use
one or more portcullises in addition to inner and outer
doors in the main gatehouse.
The long hallway through the gatehouse and the
castle walls can be designed to permit side or overhead
attacks by the defenders. To do this, the hallway is lined
on both sides by narrow arrow loops connected to hidden hallways. These loops allow the defenders to ﬁre
into attackers as they crowd into the hallway. In two-

46
story gatehouses, holes can also be added to the ceiling.
Through these “murder holes,” the defenders can ﬁre
missile weapons or pour boiling or burning liquids.
The hallway also gets narrower from the outside
coming in. This is done mainly to create a chokepoint.
An area wide enough for ﬁve people to run abreast
narrowing to only allow four causes that ﬁfth person
to either fall back or trip his comrades as they approach
the end of the tunnel.
Most castles have one gatehouse on each wall.
Multiple gatehouses would necessitate more troops to
defend each one. If the outermost wall is big enough,
then more than one entrance could be added.
In castles with an outer wall and multiple inner walls,
the gatehouses need to be oﬀset from one another. If
the gatehouses were in line with each other, attackers
could immediately get to the inner gatehouse after
breaching the outer one. The larger the oﬀset, the
larger the amount of ﬁre the defenders can bring onto
the invaders.

Buildings
Buildings provide places for people to live, eat, sleep,
and go about their business while still inside the castle.
Some of these buildings stand alone on the inside of the
courtyard. Others share one or two walls with the castle
walls. This reduces the amount of cut stone required
to erect the building and the whole castle project. It
also saves a great deal of time, as only two walls have
to be made instead of four.

• Chapter Two

Great Halls
A castle’s great hall is one of its most important buildings. This is the room where the lord performs all his
business, including receiving other nobles and dealing
with the everyday aﬀairs of governing his lands. A lord
keeps this hall presentable to any visitors, because it
reﬂects directly on their ability to rule. If the chamber
is dirty and unkempt, a visitor could assume the lord
did not care about his domain.
In most castles, the great hall is also where many of
the meals and all banquets are served. At banquets,
select members of the community and heads of larger
households are invited to the hall. Other nobles from
the surrounding areas and their families would also
be given prominent seating positions. Fathers have
arrange marriages over a large meal like this one, just
treaties have been negotiated or the groundwork for a
united attack on a common enemy has been planned
at the dinner table.
In smaller, more modest castles, these chambers
are also the lord’s quarters, as well as quarters for any
guests. This can either come from their pious nature
or from the fact that they cannot aﬀord a separate
chamber for living (either monetarily nor in terms of
space that could be used to defend the castle). Guest
quarters can also be in the great hall for very similar
reasons. If the lord must live in his great hall, then
guests can be assume to rest there, too. They shouldn’t
expect quarters better than the lord of the keep unless
they’re of a higher station than the lord. If the guest
is a king or baron in charge
of the lord, the lord gives up
his sleeping area to allow the
guest to repose in the most
comfortable location.

Places of
Worship
Throughout many
regions, people have strict
beliefs requiring them to
spend time regularly in a
religious service of some
sort. The times and locations of the services are
determined by those beliefs.
Some religions prefer them
to be in a rural wooded
location (and descendants

Tunnels
For those castles having a large and
impressive superstructure (the walls
being a meter or more below the ground),
some tunnel work is necessary for storage
or escape. The simplest tunnel can be used
as a ﬁnal escape route for a lord after his
fortress has fallen. Or a lone messenger
can ﬂee out a tunnel system with a letter
requesting urgent supplies and troops. A
tunnel can be used by a defending army
in conjunction with posterns or sally
ports to get troops outside the castle to
attack enemies.
Storage rooms and living quarters
for the people of lower class can also be
dug into the ground. This allows for the
courtyard to maintain a clean and neat
appearance while still providing adequate
living space inside the castle walls. These
chambers vary in size based on many
factors including the type of ground, the
skill of the people clearing the dirt, and
the skill of the people shoring up the walls
with timbers. Less competent workers
digging through hard earth will ﬁnd it
faster and easier to create narrow escape
tunnels rather than large chambers useful
for burial or storage.
The designers could include tunnels and
chambers intended for burial grounds.
Called catacombs, they provide not only
the burial locations for the lords and ladies

Dwarven Mountain Fortress
Wrekyon the Strong is the twelfth leader of
Runiver and the direct descendant of Adumshar Longshins, the ﬁrst Dwarf to begin the
excavation process of the stronghold.
Runiver is on the south face of one of
the southern-most mountains in a chain of
mountains. It’s been the location of numerous attempts to breech the Dwarven tunnel
system but every attempt to pass through
have failed. The large number of hidden tunnels and sally ports allow for the defenders to
attack their enemies from every front. During
one particularly vicious assault, the defenders
allowed their enemies into the great hall as a
trap. As soon as the last invader had passed
through the main entrance, the doors slammed
shut and the Dwarves commenced to destroy
their unwelcome guests.
The fortiﬁcation also has a large hidden
room where 12 generations of treasure
hordes are kept, along with various other
spoils of war and riches found in and near
the mountains.
Taszor the Wise, a very secretive and reclusive Dwarven wizard, has a study in the keep,
though he’s seldom seen among the people.

solitude. Similarly, a thief’s guild or a persecuted religion
could ﬁnd the forgotten area useful.

a Maze” sections in the third chapter of this book.

Heating and
Lighting
The rooms inside of castles would be dark places
unless there’s a way to vent smoke from ﬁres or allow
for daylight to shine inside. Though candles and torches
can provide light, these are costly alternatives to a
simple ﬁre pit or a window.

• Chapter Two

A ﬁre pit can be in the center of a ﬁrst ﬂoor
room or in a ﬁreplace along a wall. The pit’s
generally located in an earthen hole, preferably
one lined with large rocks that transfer the
heat of the ﬁre evenly to avoid explosions.
Without adequate protection against the
intense heat, a ﬁre pit cannot be placed on a
second ﬂoor for some obvious reasons. If the
ﬂoor is made of wood, it will burn through. If
the ﬂoor consists of small stones, these would
heat and cool unevenly and eventually shatter,
spraying hot shards and coals about the area.
Another consideration about the ﬁre is what
to do with the smoke. The simplest system
puts hole in the wall at the highest part of the
ceiling and another hole in the wall near the
ground to allow for enough ventilation. The
smoke rises to the ceiling and is drawn outside
as fresh air is pulled in through the other hole
in the wall. A large ductwork hood suspended
over the pit is a more complex version of this.
While this system allows heat to escape with
the smoke, it keeps people from suﬀocating
with the least amount of building work.
If a ﬁreplace and chimney for venting are
built into the wall, they can heat their room
and the room on the wall behind it. The ﬁre
heats the walls around it, which then warms
the air in adjacent rooms.
Windows are another means of lighting a room.
Those that are nothing more than holes in the wall
allow sunlight and any number of things to come inside,
such as rain, animals, and intruders.
The most basic form of window covering is a piece
of animal hide stretched thin and then soaked in oil
to make it translucent. Similarly, sturdy paper oﬀers a
(generally) inexpensive covering, though it’s susceptible
to dampness.
More expensive options include mineral sheets or
glass. Mica and some other minerals are translucent
almost to the point of being clear. The surrounding
minerals and metals determine the color, because
they stain and tint the mica. They can be hard to ﬁnd
in large enough quantity to make a single sheet for a
window. Instead, smaller pieces are ﬁtted in a frame
to make a patterned window.
Glass tile requires a large equipment cost and a master
craftsman to make. Glass, which can be colored with
certain metal powders, is dipped from the furnace and
then blown into a bubble. This bubble is then ﬂattened
to make the panes of the glass. Pieces are often welded
together by lead strips to form windows.

Castles

• 51

On most castles, windows on lower ﬂoors are tall
and very narrow, to keep people from entering through
them. Windows on upper ﬂoors, where it would be
nearly impossible for someone to reach, can be of any
size. Windows can also be barred or shuttered on either
side to keep intruders out also. Metal bars are immovable and can block some light, while wooden or metal
shutters can be opened or closed by ropes or poles to
let in more light or keep out rain or projectiles.
Specialized windows, such as holes for ﬁring missile
weapons, generally have a set shape to maximize visibility while minimizing exposure to enemy actions.
The most common of these is the arrow loop. A quarter
meter to a half meter in width, this opening is generally as tall as a person to allow the archer to aim at a
wider range of distances. (If the loop were too short,
then the archer could only ﬁre down.) The wall on the
outward side of the loop is angled out to allow for a
larger ﬁeld of ﬁre.
A more advanced type of loop contains a circular
wooden drum with two matching openings about
the same size as the arrow loop. The archer can ﬁre
through the open section and then turn the drum to
block incoming projectiles. These drums can also be
closed to keep inclement weather out.
Other types of loops are available for diﬀerent types
of weapons. For example, loops for crossbowstyle weapons are generally the exact opposite
of a bowman’s loop: The loop is horizontal
instead of vertical. This loop has a stop to
allow the crossbowmen the ability to rest their
weapons, thereby improving their aim.

Floors and
Staircases
A dirt ﬂoor is the most basic but has its
problems. It generates a lot of dust and gets
muddy and sticky when wet. Vermin can easily burrow and live in the ﬂoor. Nonetheless,
many people have lived on dirt ﬂoors for years
with neither health nor cleaning problems.
Dirt ﬂoors are common in areas where
ﬁre can be a problem, like a large kitchen or
a smithy. Food stored in a dirt-ﬂoored location is kept in large jars, baskets, or another
means of protecting the food from dust and
vermin.
Plank ﬂooring is a rather common upgrade
to dirt ﬂoors. Made from large pieces of wood
cut to shape and smoothed, the planks wear
down to a polished ﬁnish over time through

the wear of footsteps on them. Their lightness allows
for easy addition of multiple ﬂoors, as well as cellars
underneath the ground level rooms. Easy to keep clean
by sweeping and mopping, most great halls have a
plank ﬂoor in them, because this is the chamber where
all a lord’s business is conducted. Plank ﬂooring is
also useful in creating a uniform appearance with the
lord’s dais.
Cut stone ﬂoors are another upgrade to dirt ﬂoors.
These ﬂoors last for decades (unlike wooden ﬂoors) and
require little upkeep other than replacing or recementing a few stones as they come loose. Though plain stones
are most common, colored stones are sometimes used
to create a pattern or design on a ﬂoor.
In some cases, ceramic tiles are used in place of cut
stones. These tiles require less work to ﬁt together as
they’re made to shape, but they require a large outlay
for equipment and many skilled craftsmen to make
the tiles. Ceramic tile can be rather expensive to use
on a whole ﬂoor, so it appears most commonly as a
decoration of smaller areas.
Stairways are necessary to get people around inside
a castle with multiple levels. Stairs can be made either
of stone or wooden planks. While the wooden steps are
easy to build they eventually will need replacement,
while stone is harder to cut and place but will not need

52

any work other than sweeping. They staircases can also
act as a chokepoint inside the castle. They can be used
to limit the amount of access to the upper or lower
ﬂoors of the castle.
Straight staircases are quite easy to build, especially
if they’re built at the same time as the wall. Spiral
staircases require more eﬀort, but they’re useful for
rooms with limited space. Defenders learned that if the
stairway turned right, it allowed them more room to
swing their swords while inhibiting the attacker’s swing
(assuming that they are both right handed).

Roofing
There are three basic types of rooﬁng: thatch or reeds,
metal sheets, and ceramic tile. Each type of rooﬁng has
its advantages and its disadvantages. Thatch and wood
are inexpensive, but they can leak, are ﬂammable, and
need to be replaced every few years. Tile and metal
sheeting require a great deal of labor to make and to
hang, but they require little upkeep.
Using thatch or reeds as a rooﬁng material is almost
as old as housing outside of caves. The plant stalks
are generally cut from any local ﬁeld or bog, bundled,
and dried. The bundles are then laid out on a wooden
rooﬁng frame so the layers overlap. If the bundles are
improperly positioned, the roof leaks.
Dry thatch creates a real ﬁre hazard, as it can act like
tinder to ignite the entire building. If an area expects

• Chapter Two

a siege or a dragon attack, the
roofs of thatched buildings are
wet down and kept wet throughout the crisis.
Building in combat zones or
of extreme importance require
a much more stable roof. Metal
sheeting and tile provide a
sturdy roof nearly impervious
to ﬁre. Composed of whatever
metal is handy (generally lead
because it’s so easy to process),
sometimes a castle owner uses
copper or another rare yet
strong metal to show oﬀ his
wealth.
Ceramic tiles are made in the
same way that they are for ﬂooring applications. The shapes
can be ﬂat like ﬂoor tiles, half
rounded, or any other shape
desired by the builders. A pattern of overlapping ﬂat tiles is
the most common style, sometimes with runner bars
between rows, to hold the tiles in place.

Furnishings
After the castle is complete, it needs to be made
comfortable for its occupants. There are three general
styles of furnishings:
Basic furnishings are simple and utilitarian. These
items are generally crafted by the user for personal or
family use. Rough-hewn wooden chairs and a table, a
box full of straw covered in a woolen blanket for a bed,
and an unadorned iron pot for cooking are the most
basic of furnishings.
Quality furnishings exhibit more style and decoration to them than basic furnishings. Though the
user might make these items, it’s generally an artisan
who crafts them. Chairs have a woven basket seat,
the table is a bit more ornate, woven tapestries or
blankets are used on the walls and around windows
to keep out the winter winds, and things are more
than utilitarian.
Lavish furnishings adorn the utilitarian form with
decorations or design it from superior materials. A
master craftsman makes these items, and in some
cases, this craftsman is under the employment of a
lord exclusively. A wooden desk with an ornate inlay,
a set of silver ﬂatware, or a complex clockwork novelty
are examples of lavish furnishings.

Necessities
When building a castle, there are a few other matters to consider. One of them is disposing of occupant
waste. A single hole in the ﬂoor, preferably in an outof-the-way room or in another building entirely, can
serve for depositing personal waste. However, the hole
must be suﬃciently deep, or the occupants risk ﬁlling
it too quickly.
A step up from this is a bowl or pot designated for the
purpose only. The chamber pot is emptied daily either
into a dump, cess pool, or other place outside of the
building. In a basic fortiﬁcation, a simple system can
be built into the structure. A small room is constructed
on the outside of the outmost wall. A hole in the ﬂoor
provides a place for waste to go. (In important locations,
such as the lord’s chamber, a wooden or metal chair is
put over the hole.) This hole leads directly to either the
ground or the moat outside the castle. In larger castles,
an empty space is left in the wall to act as a length of
pipe to funnel the waste to the outside dumping area.
Water is another necessary part of daily life. Springs,
wells, and aqueducts can all help to fulﬁll this need. A
natural spring is an area where water literally bubbles up
from the ground. This water has been naturally ﬁltered
by the earth it ﬂows through. Where the output of the
spring is constant but not a high volume, a cistern is
built to catch the water. Cisterns use tile walls to create a
storage tank. In some cases, ﬁlter (made of small rocks,
carbon chunks, or clay) are
built into the inlets of the
cistern. These ﬁlters can be
nothing more than a series
of rocks that the water
must ﬂow over. These rocks
catch leaves and other
similarly sized material in
the water. Cisterns can also
catch rainwater.
A simple well is a deep
and narrow pit that’s dug
down to a depth below
the water level. Buckets,
dropped down, scoop up
the water and are hauled
back to the surface. Very
deep wells usually require
some sort of shoring to
keep them from collapsing.
This shoring is usually done
using stones ﬁt together to
support the walls.

Generally reserved for large cities that can aﬀord to
build such things, aqueducts are artiﬁcial rivers made
of stone or wood used to carry water from a distance
source. Although expensive and time consuming to
build, they aﬀord the city great ﬂexibility in directly
water exactly where they want it to go. Naturally, stone
channels last longer than wood ones, though they’re
more expensive. Either one wears away eventually.

Asian-Style
Castles

With wars and trade relations tying Europe and
Western Asia, the castle-building techniques migrated
from one area to the other. Designers would take the
best elements from one castle and add them to their
design. Meanwhile, Eastern Asia operated in a vacuum
of sorts, allowing this part of the world to develop its
own fortiﬁcation style.
Like European castles, walls of Eastern Asian fortiﬁcations are made of stone surrounded by a moat with
some sort of bridge that narrowed to keep attackers
out. However, the castles in some parts of Asia have to
be resistant to earthquakes, so they take on a diﬀerent
shape. Theses castle are built on a stone foundation
with a pyramid shape one or two meters tall. The walls
are most often made of stone ﬁtted tightly together
without mortar, to provide better stability.

Kinzo Mimoto’s
Fortress
Kinzo Mimoto is a skilled warlord with many followers.
His fortress was built with defense in mind. Two castles sit
in a large, artiﬁcial lake. The main castle is for show and for
guests; Kinzo lives in the secondary castle. Bridges were built
between the “mainland” and the central castle and between the
central castle and the secondary castle. The interior buildings
have wooden walls, wooden ﬂoors, paper partitions, and tile
roofs. Each castle is surrounded by a curved stone wall.
The most skilled and valued of Kinzo’s followers is Miroko
Yhukimi. The warlord is currently waging a loosing war with
his neighbors to the east, Hitimia Kinka, over trade routes.
If Mimoto can win the control of the Kikomoko valley, it will
trap thousands of Kinka’s troops in a position where they
could easily be dealt with or forced to surrender. Yhukimi is
looking for people to assist her in scouting out the location
of Kinka’s army, as well as troops to lead into war at the
Kikomoko valley.

• Chapter Two
Unfortunately, the pyramid
shape permits enemies to easily
place ramps to the walls. Thus, the
walls are designed to have a slight
outward curve to them. The wall
is often capped with a tile roof as
the tops are not used for patrolling sentries. The outside of the
wall is smooth, with any support
structures on the inside. In times
of conﬂict, planks are placed on
these supports to form a platform
from which archers can ﬁre or
troops can drop rocks. Trapdoors
and murder holes area also built
into the walls. The sentries patrol
the castle perimeter with lookouts
stationed in watchtowers inside
the castle.
Paper walls are quite common
in these castles. Ground rice
suspended in water with some
other ﬁbrous mass (silk, shredded ﬁbers, sea weed, and so on)
makes rice paper. The solution is
then dipped or poured out into
boxes with screens in the bottom.
These screens allow the water to
ﬁlter though while trapping the
rice mixture. The paper may be
pressed, squeezed, or heated to
speed the drying process. After
it dries, the paper is simply rolled
up until needed. The paper is then
ﬁtted into wooden frames that
are hung room dividers, doors,
or window coverings.

Wizard’s
Tower

The design of the wizard’s tower
is limited only by the abilities of
the wizard and the spells cast. This
section describes a few spells that
allow for casters to build a tower
of their liking.
The volume of the spell dictates
the size of the castle. Advanced
wizards can modify the spell to
build larger castles.

The shelter has a door to exit it and a small ﬁreplace
in one corner so a ﬁre can be set to create warmth and
light. The thin walls, seemingly made of the same material as the component, give the caster some protection
from the elements and physical attacks. As the spell is
focused, the caster may leave the hut without worrying
about it disappearing.

gold, and air, the caster creates a movable tower. The
tower may go up and down or across the landscape at
a rate of three meters per round. It appears to made of
white marble ﬂecked with gold and has as many doors,
windows, and staircases as the caster desires. He may also
change its shape at any point during its existence, with
the items quietly moving themselves around without
damaging themselves. At the end of the duration, the
feathers and gold dust turn to a ﬁne ash.

Aaroth the
Wizard
Aaroth the Wizard travels the
world to meet people and observe
their cultures. He has seen most
major cities in the known world and
a few in the uncharted territories.
His desire for material possessions
is rather small. He takes a trinket
or rock from each location of his
travels and has a room in his tower
just for storing them. His abilities
in conjuration are almost unparalleled, which accounts for his Spartan lifestyle. If there’s anything, he
needs he simply makes it and when
he’s done with it, it disappears.

Castles

• 57

Aaroth is also a wanted man. He was the most
powerful and outspoken member of his group, but
the group went rogue on him. They were tired of
using their abilities for the betterment of society at
ﬁnancial cost to themselves. They wanted to make
some coin the old-fashioned way: taking it by force.
Aaroth tried to dissuade his friends, but they would
have none of it and he was privately cast out. The
group still uses his name to gain access to places
they wouldn’t normally be allowed into. Then they
sack the location for anything they think is of any
value. Aaroth knows that without some outside
help he can never stop the group, who together
are more powerful than he is alone.
He built his tower using his magic. Inside it is
a little bit of everything. It’s starts out roughly
square at the bottom, about 10 meters on a side,
and twists to circular toward the top. There’s a
central shaft that runs the height of the tower.
It has a metal platform that’s moved via an air
elemental up and down. The entrance is hidden and
can only be made visible by a person uttering the
magical phrase “Open in the name of Aaroth.” The
top chamber houses an observation deck (where
the wizard takes his meals and likes to watch the
sun set). The rooms below the observation deck
(in order of level) include his bed chamber, pondering
room, library, laboratory, guest quarters, kitchen, and,
ﬁnally, stable. Each room takes up its own level. Air
elementals cool the place, while ﬁre elementals heat it.
The kitchen has been ensorcelled to provide any food
upon request. Elementals also guard the tower against
invaders and the elements.
His travels have left him with an eclectic pile that
it would take dozens of people years to catalog. His
“pondering room,” where he keeps what he’s acquired
in traveling, contains a chair in its middle and ﬂoorto-ceiling shelves and piles full of things around the
rest of the room. In some places, the piles are as high
as the shelves, but Aaroth knows what every item is
and can ﬁnd anything at almost any time.
Aaroth also has created his own version of the keep
in the air spell, which moves at a brisk 12 meters per
round. He’s used it to travel around in after accidentally
dropping in on a fellow caster in a most precarious
position that caused a great deal of tension among the
casters in his social circle.

and exterior walls may be of wood or stone, with other materials (such as branches or fabric) possible in some locations. Roofs may be of reeds, metal, or ceramic tile. Windows may be covered with animal skins, paper, glass, metal
bars, or wooden shutters. Of course, in certain settings, other building materials may be more common.
Buildings are two gold per square meter for the most common combination of walls, rooﬁng, interior partitions,
and window coverings.

Availability of Materials

Season
Once the total amount of gold has been determined, decide in which month the work began. Subtract the value
for each season, including the starting season, until the total reaches zero or less. Example: A player discovers that
a wooden-walled castle with ﬁve interior buildings, a watchtower, and a few other features costs 860 gold to build.
The gamemaster decides that it was a particularly bad spring season, when the castle’s being built, reducing the
amount of build time points available to 750. Thus, the castle won’t be ﬁnished until sometime in the summer.
• Winter (450)
• Spring (1000)
• Summer (1250)
• Fall (1000)
• Particularly bad season (-250 per season)
• Particularly good season (+250 per season)
Total number of seasons: ______________________________________________________________________
Other Factors
The gamemaster determines any other bonuses or penalties to the total gold or to the amount of time each
season. Such factors include unusual skill of the laborers, harassment by an enemy, poor labor management, lack
of income (and thus gold), and so on.

and other
places
Now, we’ve come to the good part
— my section. Considering that our
travels took us to an odd assortment
of places, I’ve alphabetized the entries
to make it easier for you to return to a
particular point in our journey.

Dragon’s
Cave

Most adventuring parties, when presented with a gargantuan winged shadow
that engulfs them all, would take this as
a cue to hide. Or perhaps ﬂee.
It was Okent’s idea to follow the
Dragon. My idea — which involved
informing distant taverns of this potential threat — was discarded.
In the sketches and ballads, they
often depict the Dragon’s lair as being
at ground level, with a sylvan glen
leading to a nice straightforward cave.
I know now how foolish a concept this
is. Most Dragons can ﬂy, and most ﬂying
creatures make their homes in places
that can only be reached by ﬂight. Now,
while Dragons don’t reside in trees (at

least, I hope not), they do prefer caves that can be only
be easily reached from the air. I would assume that
ﬂightless Dragons would stay in mountainside caves
they could climb or slither up to, but it’s possible they
could reside underground.
They can, however, also be reached by backbreaking
eﬀort. In all, climbing the mountain was Very Diﬃcult,
although it was made easier because we could take
our time.
The cave extended inwards a ways, then opened into
an entry area of some sort. It was large and almost
devoid of illumination. (Anyone who doesn’t bring a
light source or alternate form of vision to a Dragon
cave should be prepared to face complete darkness.)
This was our ﬁrst hint at the scope of what we were to
encounter. The light of day was far behind us, and the
echoes of our footsteps echoed loudly ahead of us.
The scope of that initial chamber took our breaths
away. We knew the rest of the mountainside extended
above and beyond us, but we hadn’t fully considered
that it might be hollow; it extended at least 30 meters
above. A Dragon capable of hovering could probably be
leisurely in destroying us. (Of course, the Dragon also
might have lucked out in ﬁnding such a great spot; in
remembering similar caves we’ve explored, I note that
most such chambers usually have at least a few ledges
where foolhardy ﬁghters could scale to and engage a
ﬂying creature directly. Regardless, in this situation,
archers or others capable of ranged attacks are worth
their weight in gold.)
We explored a couple of other tributaries. Like other
caves we’ve seen, these contained obstacles trivial for
a giant Dragon to overcome, but proved really challenging for us. Some examples (drawn from both this
Dragon’s cave and others I’ve researched):
• Changes in altitude and grade — dangerously

age and disorientation
if they aren’t capable
of Difficult acrobatics
maneuvers. Also possible are utterly inaccessible places, such
as the cave continuing
up a 10-meter sheer
“cliﬀ ” face (or down a
10-meter drop).
• Damaging terrain
— the ﬂoor of one chamber was littered with
thousands of flawed,
shattered gemstones
broken up into the most
costly caltrops imaginable.
• Other monsters
— although they were
not evident in this cave,
intelligent and semiintelligent creatures
could make their home
within a Dragon cave
in a symbiotic relationship. They would know enough
not to attack the gargantuan ﬁre-spewing creature,
and would serve as a ﬁrst line of defense and warning
to the dragon.
Two of the side caves were made of hard, nonporous
rock, and contained large pools that I recognized as
quicksilver; the fumes were unbearable, and it took a
quick prayer (and the resultant divine intervention) by
Raichael to keep us from succumbing. I’d never seen that
much of the liquid metal before; alchemists would have
a king’s ransom, if they could survive to gather it.
Later on, we stumbled across another chamber;
unlike the rest of the cavern’s tributaries, this one
was not designed by or for Dragons. In fact, it was
barely Human-sized, and we squeezed single-ﬁle. In
the small chamber beyond, there were magical glyphs
everywhere. We avoided them, but it seemed to be some
kind of protective chamber. A small pile of treasure
rested inside the central circle, resembling some kind
of golden “nest.” We didn’t investigate further, since
that would have entailed crossing the wards.
Finally, we emerged into one high-vaulted cavern
chamber. Our torches were guttering at this point as
we navigated the steeply ascending terrain ahead of
us. Midway up the incline, Okent commented about
feeling slight tremors. We glimpsed ﬂares of ﬂame
ahead of us. As we got closer, we saw a smooth, curved

rock shift toward us. I think it was Grubba who ﬁrst
realized it was an eye.
“Is this lunch crawling on my back?” we heard the
booming voice beneath us say.
“Uhh ... no?” I stammered.
The dragon hmmed. “What is the weather like
outside?”
“It’s ... damp?” Raichael oﬀered.
“I see.” There was a long pause. “Before being awakened, I had the oddest dream that I roasted some
Humans alive who were crawling on my back. Strangely
enough, my dreams often come true. Do you take my
meaning?”
“Was there a Dwarf in your dream?” I asked shortly
before Okent cuﬀed me across the head.
“There was. I swallowed him whole.”
“Right. Umm ... we were just leaving.”
“I know you were.”
And with that, we beat a hasty retreat; only then did
we notice the bodies, skeletons, and piles of treasure and
coins littered around and under the Dragon. I was so
stunned on the way out, I was only able to ﬁnd several
handfuls of gold. Oh, and a sparkling wand.
To make a long story short, we somehow went from
moving quickly out of the cave to running for our lives.
Several days later, we concluded that we had evaded
the pursuing Dragon. However, I am deeply concerned

62

Caltrops
Maneuvering through caltrops requires an acrobatics roll,
with a diﬃculty ranging from 10 to 20, depending on the
quantity and quality of caltrops. (In theory, the diﬃculty could
get up to 25, although at that point, there would be so many
hideously expensive caltrops on the ﬂoor that it’d indistinguishable from a bed of nails.) It normally takes twice as long to
maneuver through a bed of caltrops than it does clear terrain;
thus maneuvering through a 10-meter patch of caltrops would
take two rounds for a person with a Move of 10. Taking extra
time to “prepare” means wading through the caltrops longer
but lessening injury, while rushing through the ﬁeld increases
the diﬃculty — and the damage. (See the “Preparing” and
“Rushing” rules on page 52 of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook.)
If the character doesn’t make this acrobatics roll, the degree of
failure is the damage done to the person traversing the caltrops.
However, this damage cannot exceed the diﬃculty rating of the
caltrops. Depending on the character’s attire, the gamemaster
may decide that her armor doesn’t protect her.
Regardless of the acrobatics roll or any damage taken, the
person moving across the caltrops gets past them (unless she
is Stunned or otherwise slowed down by injury).
Example: Okent is chasing a cutpurse who scatters caltrops
behind him (covering a 10-meter patch). The caltrops are
shoddy, having a diﬃculty rating of 10. Okent would normally
need to take two rounds to get across that patch, but he needs
to pass through it as quickly as possible, so he takes 50% less
time, incurring a +10 diﬃculty penalty (raising the acrobatics
diﬃculty to 20). Okent’s player rolls abysmally, failing his
acrobatics roll by 14. However, since the caltrops only have a
diﬃculty rating of 10, Okent only needs to deal with 10 points
of damage. If he had failed the roll by 6, he would only need
to deal with six points of damage. Regardless, he traverses the
patch and continues the chase.
Caltrops have a price diﬃculty or number of gold per 10meter square coverage equal to their diﬃculty rating, up to
20. In use, a person can drop twice as many caltrops to get a
+5 bonus. (Thus someone could buy two batches of diﬃculty
10 caltrops, or one batch of diﬃculty 15, and get the same
result.) Deploying caltrops requires a throwing total of 10 or
greater to accurately cover a 10-meter area; this deployment
range can be no greater than two meters.

I threw my newfound gold behind us and said
I didn’t have any more of its treasure.
It is a beautiful wand, though.

Variana
Even among the temperamental Earth
Dragons, Variana is known for her extreme
capriciousness. Within the course of a single
conversation, she can go from haughty to
conversational to murderous to reconciliatory.
Yet even these mood swings are not constant;
she has been known to exhibit the same personality for a month or more.
Scholars who have researched Variana have
diﬀering opinions regarding her irrationality.
Some argue that, since her egg hatched in an
area prone to earthquakes, her spirit absorbed
the unstable nature of her birth land. Others
posit that she has spent most of her life around
natural deposits of the liquid metal mercury,
which has shaped her mind. Another theory
holds that her magical nature makes her as
unstable as the eldritch energies she seeks
to control. Still others argue that she was
merely born somewhat crazy; expansions of
this theory speculate that the land around
Variana may change in response to her moods.
Regardless, sages agree that anyone who
pierces the mystery of her psyche might gain
invaluable knowledge into the link between
Earth Dragons and the land itself.
Sadly, most seekers of lore have done little
ﬁrst-hand investigation of this enigma; sage
guilds and religions alike take a dim view of
suicide.
Perhaps the only reason Variana’s eccentricities are tolerated (outside of the fact that
there’s no one powerful enough to do anything
about it) is that she is as much a force for good
as she is for ill. After years without incident, she
hovered over a nearby city to bestow treasure
and grain during a blight. Three years later,
well after the city had recovered, she went
on binging raids against farmers’ livestock.
Yet another time, she drove oﬀ a pack of Fire
Dragons who threatened area villages.
The fact she possesses vast knowledge of
the arcane arts is not a secret. In fact, many
mages and sages seek her out to request aid or

Other Places

• 63

enlightenment, although a smaller subset of those
walk away from the encounter and an even smaller
subset have any kind of satisfaction. However, one
of her most closely guarded secrets is that she is
extensively proﬁcient in shapeshifting, and often
walks among the two-legs in cities seeking adventure, treasure, and occasionally aid. Her vanity
means that she never chooses anything less than
a stunningly beautiful form (of either gender), and
her temperament ensures that trouble will follow
wherever she goes.
Beyond these excursions (and the occasional
lunch raid on wild or tamed animals), she keeps more
or less to herself, unless bothered. What happens
in those situations is entirely dependent on her
frame of mind. However, if her home is threatened,
she will ﬁght with unbridled ferocity to resolve the
situation. She’s spent an Elf’s lifetime attuning
herself to her cave, and she knows her survival is
directly tied to its.
Within a campaign, Variana can exist as a catalyst
for any kind of “Dragon” story the gamemaster
would like to run. Her shapechanging abilities make
it possible to inﬁltrate Human (or other) society,
where she might seek adventurers to aid her. She
might be sought in her home as part of a larger
story; she possesses many rare treasures and arcane
knowledges. If provoked (or if she slips into a darker
mood swing), she can be a ferocious foe. Lately, she
has been harboring more maternal feelings, going
so far as to set up a protective chamber for a nest.
If a group were to do a service to make this possible
— such as ﬁnding her a mate or protect her oﬀspring
— she would probably be grateful as long as she
was still sane. Of course, the nearby locals would
be worried as long as they were still alive ...

The Home Cave
Advantage
Dragons are fully described in D6 Fantasy Creatures (page
23–27), and that volume should be consulted for general
information about them. The Earth Dragon is the type
most commonly found in caves, although other Dragons
might be found here if some other aspect of the cave suits
their environment. For example, a cave in a cloud-scraping mountain might attract a pack of Air Dragons, while
a volcano’s cavern system might lure a Fire Dragon.
The specimens described in D6 Fantasy Creatures are
“typical” versions; young dragons can be somewhat less
powerful, while elder dragons can be much, much deadlier.
Even for experienced adventuring groups, an encounter
with a Dragon should never be trivial ... especially for those
who dare confront a Dragon within its own cave.
Those Dragons who live in caves almost universally have
Infravision or Ultravision (D6 Fantasy Rulebook, page 35),
which enables them to navigate and defend their own cave
fully. However, some Dragons are unable to see in the dark
normally but instead develop a “sense” about their own
caves; in other dark situations they maneuver no better
than anything else, but within their caverns they hold
absolute dominion. Such a Dragon’s “cave sense” might
be represented by the Special Ability:
Ultravision (R6), +12 to sight-based totals in darkness
with Restricted (R3), to Dragon’s own cave.
In fact, “Restricted (R3), to Dragon’s own cave” can be a
useful addition to a Dragon’s repertoire for many Special
Abilities, representing the signiﬁcant advantages a Dragon
has in its own habitat. Combat Sense, Sense of Direction,
Skill Bonus, or Skill Minimum are all reasonable Special
Abilities for Dragons to have within their caves, and even
more unusual ones such as Luck or Ventriloquism are
not impossible. (“Yes, tiny pink ones, you hear my voice
all around you, do you not? It is so rare I get to play with
my food ...”)
Of course, Dragons are also powerful and mysterious
enough to have these abilities outside their caves as
well.

Although he believes in furthering the causes of good,
Okent isn’t prone to displays of
spirituality. So when, without
provocation, he said, “I have to
go this way,” and darted oﬀ in
an apparently random direction within the bustling seaside
town of Inachon’s Point, we
followed.
We arrived outside a boxlike
building. It stood out against its
surroundings by its contradictions: It was, simultaneously,
less ornate yet more refined
than the neighboring buildings.
Lacking the elaborate statues,
lanterns, or bright paints of the
other shops and homes around it, it should have been
completely invisible. But it wasn’t. The building itself
was the most reﬁned place of its type I’d ever seen. While
the other shops and houses seemed content with serving their functions adequately, this place wanted to be
the best ... whatever it was. The rich planks of its walls
and doors were thin but strong cherry wood, precise and
beautifully interlocked. The front entrance had three
graceful characters above it, which I transcribed into
my notes. We entered and immediately felt at ease as
the faint smell of incense infused us.
The entry chamber continued the simple beauty of
the exterior, and I realized now that this must be a school
of some sort. It had an aura of education; individual
mats pointed toward a slate, which had pictographs
obviously depicting a small man throwing a bear over
his shoulder.
After several minutes, our tranquil study of this place
was startled back to reality by the sound of Raichael

Other Places

• 65

gasping; we turned to see what caught her attention,
and noted a man standing there. He introduced himself
as Master Quyen Ota. Seemingly young and vibrant
yet with an atmosphere of power and experience, he
asked why we had come. Okent explained that he felt
compelled to come here.
Quyen nodded, as if this was not in the least bit
unusual, and said, “Do you wish training?” Okent
paused, struggling to answer. Quyen continued. “I
should warn you, however, that the Path of Stone is
diﬃcult, and it must only be used for good. You must
defend the weak, protect the innocent, and uphold
virtue. Are you prepared to do this?”
I guﬀawed, and others in our party snickered as
well. Master Ota might have well asked if the sun had
plans on rising in the morning. I caught the teacher’s
eye and noted the gleam signifying he understood the
rhetorical nature of his own question. Okent himself
was smirking, and he nodded in the aﬃrmative.
I asked Master Ota what the markings above the
entrance into the building meant. He smiled and said,
“Step through this doorway and learn.” I nodded.
Okent’s training mirrored the structure of the dojo
itself. He began in the robing room, which was bare
save for places to hang normal clothing and two sets
of robes. One set of white cotton robes were worn for
functional instruction while the other silk set was more
ceremonial, although still not overly gaudy. The color of
the silk robes denoted the level of training. The red robes
indicated a novice, followed by orange, yellow, green,
blue, and purple, which
signified the highest
rank. A sign on the door
indicates whether the
room is in use. (When
asked if women were
permitted training from
his school, Master Ota
replied, “Only hubris
would allow an architect
to build a house while
excluding its walls.” This
drew an appreciative
nod from Raichael.) We
were also introduced to
the washroom, which
provided private facilities, including a bath.
After Okent changed,
Master Ota took him
to the nafudakake — a
board showing the rank-

ings of all the students, with each name engraved on a
thin vertical plank. This board ensured that pupils of
roughly equal levels trained against each other, and it
gave students something to strive for. Quyen explained
that, although there were seven other students listed
(three red robes, two oranges, a yellow, and a blue),
this was the beginning of a month-long event for his
students at a martial arts competition in another place.
He frowned as he said it — the ﬁrst betrayal of his inner
calm — but informed us that Okent would be his only
student during this period.
A small shelf containing small ceremonial items
and an actual bound book was also along the wall. The
book, Master Ota told me, was called the Precepts of
Stone, and it contained most of his martial teachings.
“If such a book were to fall into the wrong hands,” he
said gravely, “the results could be dire.” Grubba asked,
“If that’s true, then why isn’t it kept in a vault?” Quyen
explained that, to lock away knowledge is to entrap it,
which is a dishonor. “Besides,” he said, “As long as I live
here, it has a guardian.” While I had little doubt as to
the Master’s eﬃcacy, I nevertheless worried: Couldn’t
the book be used to train an army with the might of
Master Ota, but without his discipline and honor?
And then we were led to the training room. This
served as our primary residence for the next few weeks,
becoming our domicile and Okent’s chamber of beatings. (At least, that’s how it seemed to me.) This room
consisted of a huge padded area, a storage closet containing additional training supplies, and a small shrine

along one wall devoted to the spirit of stone. Lighting
usually came in from overhead through a translucent
paper ceiling, although in times of inclement weather,
the roof was covered and we used lanterns inside.
Once Okent’s training began, I was surprised to see
that Master Ota wore the same red robes as an initiate.
When I asked him why this was, he answered, “The true
master knows that he is but a novice. The more he learns,
the more he knows that he knows nothing.”
The mat, I discovered, consisted of modular segments
that could be changed to simulate diﬀerent conditions
or situations. The standard ﬂooring was tightly woven
straw, which provided ample padding. During the course
of the month, however, we watched Okent train on
many types of mats and surfaces:
• A gigantic silk sheet covering the entire ﬂoor, making it treacherous and slippery.
• A grid of crisscrossing bamboo, about a half meter
oﬀ the ground. The gaps in the bamboo force the
combatants to stay focused, lest their feet fall into the
empty squares and put their ankles at risk.

• Chapter Three

• A large valley formed by wooden segments
and spanning the entire area. Extending two
meters oﬀ the ground at each side, this training
method forces students to be aware of slanted
surfaces and height diﬀerences.
• A balance beam positioned three meters
oﬀ the ground, with the usual objective being
to knock the opponent to the padded ﬂoor. At
ﬁrst, Okent believed this was solely to train
him in balance and to ﬁght along a line. But late
in his training — and in a moment of clarity
— he swung underneath the beam, using his
momentum to carry him under and over the
beam, knocking Master Ota oﬀ. The Master was
impressed and greatly pleased, noting that a true
master of the martial arts does not limit himself
to preconceived notions or self-imposed limits,
outside of those dictated by honor.
In addition to simulating diﬀerent environments with the mats, Master Ota trained
Okent in various conditions, including being
blindfolded, having the arms or legs restrained,
and ﬁghting while both combatants hold the
same pole — the goal is to get your opponent
to let go.
After several weeks, I was surprised to learn
that the paper ceiling was not entirely for light,
as Okent and Quyen sparred on the roof. The
object was to not get knocked through the ceiling ... or, if you were, to avoid bruising one’s
posterior as much as one’s pride. Okent’s ﬁnal
match, to determine his level of mastery, involved
a dizzying three-tier battle: The balance beam was
hoisted to the roof, and Okent and Quyen started atop
it, battling to the rooftop, through the ceiling, to the
mat below, and eventually sparring into the entrance
antechamber before Master Ota, appearing pleased,
called the match over.
Finally, after a month, Okent was presented with a
yellow robe in a formal ceremony. “You are permitted to
resume your journey whenever you like,” Master Ota said,
“and your name shall remain on the nafudakake.”
As we left that noble school, I noticed — for the
ﬁrst time — the characters above the doorway leading
outside. I smiled, realizing they were the same as those
leading in: “Step through this doorway and learn.”

The trouble with inﬁltrating the Challenger’s Forge
was multifold.
Learning of the event. Sure, we just stumbled
across it (thanks to Okent), but how do others ﬁnd out
about this event? I have some theories. This competition
might be a big deal among martial arts types, such that,
if you’re the bulkiest muscle-bound board-breaker in
ﬁve counties, they’ll ﬁnd you. But I suspect that knowledge of this event might be lore in particular regions,
or among certain family lines. Why might that young
gal be competing? Because every ﬁrstborn child in her
family has competed for generations. It might also be
common lore among some martial training schools.
Or it might be a “prize” at the end of an arduous maze
or dungeon: “Congratulations! By opening this chest,
you qualify as a competitor for ...” Regardless, it’s a
well-kept secret, and learning about it could well be
an exciting tale itself.
Finding out where the event is. This was more
diﬃcult than I imagined. How hard could it be to track
down a competition housing over a hundred freaks
bristling with bone-crunching power? Well, it turns
out it’s pretty troublesome when it’s not in this world.
The Challenger’s Forge is, as best I can describe, hidden in an extradimensional space. We reached it from
a certain riverside dock we learned about, showing
a special marker to the quiet yet creepy captain of a
small boat. He rowed us down a littler known river

tributary — a stretch of river, Raichael assures me,
she had investigated previously. The air surrounding
us became dark and ominous, and after a while we
docked outside a series of buildings that seemed to be
the support facilities to keep all the competitors and
their supporters fed and housed. (If I were writing
such a tale and looking for a more realistic premise, I
note that a competition could easily be kept secret in
an underground cavern system ... or perhaps a village
whose citizens transform their town into the arena,
making it a regional secret.)
Getting an invitation. As I mentioned, we needed
a marker to show the boatman. The marker in question
was a small painted ceramic tile, resembling those used
by the area residents to play a local game. These were
in limited quantity but didn’t seem tied to a particular
competitor. Again, the tale behind how we tracked
down and retrieved one of these markers will make
for a rousing ditty all its own.
Paying the mark. Once we arrived at the event, our
ﬁrst encounter was with Susumu, a groundskeeper for
the Arena. He asked who was competing, and wanted
to know what we had brought to wager. Apparently
this event goes on the assumption that each competitor will make an oﬀering to the game. This must be an
item of great value, and most of our mundane oﬀerings
were rejected. Finally, Okent oﬀered the wand we had
retrieved from the dragon’s cave. Susumu accepted it.
I cried. Raichael muttered that Susumu had a destiny
path too akin to the boatman. When pressed for clari-

Air: The ropes require skill to swing and maneuver
with. The complex way to represent this is to call for
an acrobatics roll each turn to maneuver into position on the ropes, with a minimum diﬃculty of 13.
Swinging from the ropes and attacking in the same
round necessitates two actions, and incurs a multiaction penalty as a result (see D6 Fantasy Rulebook,
page 51). Hanging from a rope does not require an
action, although anyone attacking that person hanging from the rope will have a +5 bonus.
The simple way to handle combat in the Air area
is by assigning a +10 modiﬁer to all actions while
hanging or swinging from the ropes; failure indicates
a miss, while failure by more than 10 indicates a
possible fall to the spikes (with an acrobatics check
at 15 to avoid this).
The sharpened spikes deal 3D damage to anyone
who falls, drops, or is tackled on them. The ropes
have a Toughness of 0 each, and thus ropes taking

The Breeze competitors fought over the course of
several days, and our clandestine search of the grounds
for Hideaki proved fruitless. The Breeze competitors
and their supporters were dismissed, forced to leave the
event; the “inferior” weaker ﬁghters weren’t permitted
to watch the more skilled combatants. The top three
competitors collected a share of the rewards based on
the value of the markers staked by the Breeze competitors: First place won 50 percent of the treasure value,
second place won 30 percent, and last place won 10
percent. (Nanashi claimed the remaining 10 percent
as the cost of upkeep.)
The next day, the Wind ﬁghters took to the stage;
still there was no sign of Shadohowl. The Arena had
been completely redesigned — not merely what was on
the ﬂoor, but its actual shape and structure. The Arena
ﬂoor had been replaced with a smaller 20-meter circle.
This time, the spectators sat above the proceedings,
climbing ladders to another 20-meter disc that hovered above the Arena. This ﬂoating platform seemed
as transparent as water, yet solid as stone. These were
clearly powerful magics.
The Wind-level competition had the ﬁghters face oﬀ
two at a time in randomly chosen teams. Most of the
ﬁghters here relied on a “gimmick.” I’m not trying to dismiss their abilities, but they had a more unifying theme
than their Breeze counterparts. Some of them had
magics or abilities that corresponded with an element
or environmental condition (lightning, ﬁre,
metal, or the like), some
had a preferred prop or
weapon, and others had
a form of attack they’d
studied to the exclusion
of all others (such as
one gentleman I dubbed
“Crazy Only-Able-ToKick Man”).
After each round of
Wind competition, the
teams were mixed up at
random, so no team had
an advantage. Finally,
when the competitors
were down to one team,
Nanashi had that team
face oﬀ in one-on-one
combat. As it so happens, Okent survived
each round and went on
to the ﬁnal. He wasn’t

the best ﬁghter, but he’s a born leader and got his
teammates to work with him better than anyone else.
Through the luck of the draw, Okent’s ﬁnal teammate
happened to be weaker than him, and Okent won the
battle (albeit not without some bruising).
Again we searched for Hideaki during this competition, but the old man was nowhere to be found. We
conferred with Okent brieﬂy before his victory round,
telling him we needed more time; unfortunately, we
would be sent home after this ﬁght if we didn’t think
of an excuse to stay. Okent pondered this, and after
he won against his ﬁnal battle, he requested that he
be permitted to compete in the Typhoon event. There
were gasps from the audience. Nanashi gave an enigmatic smile, and said that to do so Okent would need
to forfeit his winnings from the Wind level, to prevent
people from ﬁghting below their level for easy treasure.
Okent said, “That is agreeable,” and they carted away
his treasure. I cried.
Two days later, the Typhoon competition began. It
was then that we received word: Shadohowl had arrived.
Not wanting to associate with the “riﬀraﬀ ” of weaker
competitions, he purposefully showed up as late as possible. Even so, we couldn’t see him, because he stayed
hidden in his tent; even his servants that kept watch
over the outside of his tent looked massive.
We concluded that Hideaki must be within that tent,
and we’d only have one chance to rescue him: during

Typhoon Arena
Challenges
The terrain in the Typhoon-level Arena can be extremely
dangerous.
Any time a character rolls a one on the Wild Die, roll
one regular die and consult this table:
1: A hazard springs up or shoots out, causing the character
1D to 6D damage (roll 1D to determine how many
damage dice to roll).
2: The character is impaired by a bright light, spray, dust,
etc. for one round.
3: The character steps in a trap, goo, muck, etc. and can’t
move for one round, though he can still take upperbody-only actions.
4: The character stumbles or is distracted and loses initiative next round.
5: The character’s upper body is entangled or immobilized
for one round, but she can still use her legs.
6: The character drops his weapon or, if he has no weapon,
he’s stunned by some circumstance. In either case,
he must spend the next round doing nothing but
recovering.

a time when Shadohowl was competing. All that was
required was the luck of the draw permitting Okent to
compete after Shadohowl, since if he competed before
and lost, he’d be forced to go home.
So, naturally, Nanashi demanded that Okent and
Shadohowl ﬁght at the same time ... each other. Clearly
the gods have a strange sense of humor.
For the Typhoon competitions, Nanashi pulls out
all the stops to make as interesting and tortuous a
background as possible. For Okent and Shadohowl’s
battle, Nanashi set up the Arena with a border of strange
contraptions, each four meters tall, spinning a wall of
swords, axes, knives, ﬂails, and other weapons. Getting
too close to any part of the edge except the entryway
was a sure way to get hurt — bad. In addition, large
sections of the dirt ﬂoor had hidden traps: vents to
underground hot springs, bear traps, and the like.
The Arena ﬂoor was enlarged to 40 meters; there
weren’t as many seats this time since everyone else
except Typhoon competitors and their helpers had
been sent home.

• Chapter Three

The competition began, and for the ﬁrst time
we saw Shadohowl: a three-meter tall hulking
brute of a man whose muscles rippled with power
and whose eyes glinted with a cold cruelty. This
man not only loved ﬁghting and bringing pain to
others; he lived for it.
We heard Nanashi’s condition for this battle:
until someone surrenders. We learned that
Nanashi seldom imposes any other unusual
terms on these battles, preferring it to remain a
competition among equals (or those who think
they’re equals, at any rate). However, Nanashi
does impose varying designations for the end of
the match, and will commonly deign them “to the
death” — especially if it seems there is animosity
or a grudge between the competitors.
Our plan was simple: Okent would battle Shadohowl, and at the same time, we would investigate
Shadohowl’s tent to ﬁnd Hideaki.
The tournament began, and after a couple of
rounds, we realized that Okent was entirely out
of his depths. He was struck so hard across the
face that a thin mist of blood ﬂew across us, and
Raichael wanted to spring into the Arena to help
him. Okent, holding himself together, shouted
at us, “Go; do what you must!” Grubba guided
Raichael as I sneaked ahead to Shadohowl’s tent.
The guards there put up an incredible ﬁght, and I
was only able to imagine what Okent was going
through. There within the tent, a weak and frail
old man lay bound and gagged on the ﬂoor; as
we freed him, he identiﬁed himself as Hideaki. We
began our escape.
As Grubba and Raichael guided Hideaki back to the
boatman, I returned to the Arena ... hoping to ﬁnd
Okent still alive.
Okent had discovered his best strategy was to stay
out of Shadohowl’s way. In fact, that was the only way
he had any hope of surviving. I could hear the buzz from
within the audience: Why wasn’t he surrendering? Did
he want to die? Will this be the blow that kills him?
The dirt of the Arena ﬂoor was slick from Okent’s
wounds, and it looked like one more blow would ﬁnish
him. I gave a whistle as I approached, and caught Okent’s
eye. Raising his head weakly, he said, “I surrender.”
Shadohowl replied, “I don’t care,” and went in for
one more attack — a blow, everyone knew, would be
fatal.
I’m not sure why I did it, or even how, but I found
myself moving as fast as I could, acrobatically vaulting
over the whirring perimeter to interpose. My attack surprised Shadohowl, knocking him back. Again fortune

was with me, as he stepped into a pit of a supernaturally
cold substance, which clung to his foot and no doubt
caused him incredible pain.
Okent struggled to stand as I pressed the advantage.
I started taunting him, hurling every mocking invective
I could muster. I must have done something right (or
wrong), because he hurled himself at me in an inhuman
rage. Again I mustered my courage and, as he charged
me, I ducked, using my legs to pivot him up and over
me ... into the bladed walls.
Immediately the lummox became jammed between
two of the devices, an axe imbedded in his chest and
a morningstar wrapped around his legs. Rather than
harming him signiﬁcantly, it just made him angrier; his
conﬁnement no doubt added to his rage. But I didn’t
care as I escorted our badly hurt friend out.
We made haste and escaped via the boatman — curiously, Nanashi was nowhere to be found — and eventually returned Hideaki to his village. The villagers were
ecstatic and helped tend Okent’s wounds. Part of me
was glad we did the right thing, but another part of
me realizes that doing so cost us a large winning that
Okent had won, and we’d earned a powerful, cunning
enemy who will, no doubt, be hunting for us now.

Labyrinth of
Kephalos

Kephalos, an emperor who was justly elected with
the help of a carafe of poison, thought it would be a
good idea to sink a decade’s worth of his kingdom’s
income into the construction of an elaborate labyrinth.
His people, while showing their appreciation at being
driven to the brink of poverty, misplaced a dagger
between his ribs. Rumor has it that pieces of his corpse
were accidentally tied to large rats and released into
the labyrinth.
Centuries later the labyrinth — or Kephalos’ Demise,
as it’s also known — remains an impressive legacy of
the Kephalos reign. In fact, modern descendants in the
region view the construct with a sense of pride, and look
back on the emperor’s era with a certain nostalgia.
Our travels brought us to this labyrinth in the spring,
with the heat high and our tempers short. To make a
complex story simple, someone in our group was found
in a compromising position with the current emperor’s
curious daughter, there was a trial, and this person
was thrown — along with his companions — into the
labyrinth. This person is truly sorry, and has learned
a valuable lesson: Don’t get caught.
Anyway, this kingdom’s laws have evolved for serious oﬀenses to a trial by ordeal; those who escape
are considered innocent, and those who don’t are
considered guilty. (There’s actually a fair bit of debate

Other Places

• 75

about how this code of
justice evolved; apparently before Kephalos,
there was an elaborate
judicial system that
relied on a “jury by
peers”; this system was
discarded after Kephalos’ reign. I suspect the
rationale was, “Well,
as long as we have this
great labyrinth ...”)
We were allowed to
bring all our gear; the
reasons behind this
were confusing, having to do with the time
of year, the omens of
the stars, and (for all
I know) the size of our
boots. Apparently, the
essence of transgressors’ guilt and punishment is determined by
the emperor, while the
priestess determines
the classification of
guilt and the conditions
of punishment. (In our
case, the emperor found
us guilty of doing something wrong; the priestess
decided it was an “imperial transgression.”) The result
of this is that the emperor gets to decide whether
someone is thrown into the labyrinth, while the
priestess decides how easy it is to get to the center
and light the signal ﬁre, which notiﬁes the keepers to
unlock the entrance to the maze. Then, the prisoners
need to safely make it back to the beginning, which
has become the way out.
In researching the matter, I learned of some other
conditions the priestess has placed on those tossed
into the maze:
• Weapons only; no armor (or vice versa)
• All gear except torches, lanterns, or other light
sources
• The group must be attached to each other in a line
with chains
• No gear or clothing permitted
• The party must escape within a certain amount of
time (for example, a day)
• The party must spend a certain amount of time
within the open-air chamber (for example, a day)

And so on. The limitations so placed seem constrained
only by her creativity.
We learned that the labyrinth also is used for other
rituals and festivals, especially the larger chambers
and open-air portions. For example, one of their local
temples sponsors a “Closeness of Community” ritual
each spring solstice, where the faithful mill about the
maze, learning to rely on each other to ensure that no
member of the community is lost or left behind. Before
these events, a group of brave individuals scopes out
the labyrinth, clearing out any obvious corpses or critters and negotiating with the Minotaur. These groups
are prevented from getting lost by the tying one end
of a spool of string to the beginning of the entrance,
with the party unwinding the spool as they travel; they
only need to rewind the spool to ﬁnd their way out. (Of
course, if someone or something within the labyrinth
were to cut, eat, or retie the string, life could get very
complicated for those travelers ...)
However, this information didn’t help us in our
punishment. The underground half of the construct

dark; however, the open-air portion was lit by whatever
ambient sunlight shone from above. The labyrinth’s
walls were smooth yet intricately decorated, containing glyphs, engravings, and pictographs, as well as
the clawing and scratching of those who’ve passed
through the maze. Although it would be Very Diﬃcult,
I imagine anyone who had an appropriate scholar ability
could learn a lot about the history and customs of this
region’s past; who knows what treasures the carvings
might describe? (Of course, going voluntarily into the

maze speciﬁcally for such lore would be a foolhardy
move, in my experienced opinion.)
The maze itself was challenging, and the chittering
of various life forms kept us on edge. We managed to
get to the center and light the signal ﬁre in short order,
but then we realized we had forgotten how to get back
to the start. After wandering the corridors for a halfhour, we had an encounter with a fearsome creature:
a three-meter-tall Minotaur!
Resisting the urge to ﬁght or ﬂee, Raichael invoked
a miracle that soothed the creature and
helped us charm it into guiding us to escape.

Since half of the maze exists in the open air, it may occur
to some to clamber over walls. They are 10 meters tall and are
considered smooth for climbing purposes (+20 diﬃculty; see
“Climbing” on page 56 of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook), although
given enough time and eﬀort, it’s certainly possible. Of
course, those able to ﬂy over the walls would not have any
such diﬃculty.
Finally, some might consider digging their way under the
walls. This is slightly easier but more time consuming than
going through the walls. The ﬂoor has a toughness of 2D+2 and
takes 12 points of damage to yield a hole big enough for one
Human-sized tunneler (modiﬁed by the scale rules, as above);
it takes two such successful attempts to get under a wall.
Regardless, most of these eﬀorts would be, of course,
damaging to the Labyrinth of Kephalos. If these attempts are
discovered and the damage is signiﬁcant, the emperor would be
most displeased (as would some of the maze’s inhabitants).

Aischros the
Minotaur
Aischros is a sad specimen of a Minotaur.
Long ago, Aischros stole some supplies
from the original construction site of the
Labyrinth of Kephalos. When the emperor’s
guards tracked down the bull-headed creature, they dragged him back before the
ruler. Whether Emperor Kephalos was more
or less merciful to Aischros than similar
thieves (whom he sentenced to death) is
open to debate; Kephalos decreed that
Aischros stay within the conﬁnes of the
construction site for the rest of his days. The
priestess, Lady Thaleia of the Half-Light,
insisted that her own will be added to the
sentence. She asked her deity to bestow
Aischros with longevity and the need to
never eat. (Scholars who know this tale

Other Places

• 77

suspect it is the ﬁrst instance of this kingdom’s unusual
dual sentencing ritual.)
Over the course of years, the rest of the maze was
constructed around the Minotaur; the last brick sealed
the hole where his glowering red eyes peered out.
Over the centuries since, Aischros has wandered the
labyrinth. The intense solitude has caused his mind
to fracture. Part of him wishes nothing more but to
escape. However, shortly before reaching the exit, the
other portion of his mind awakens; this part wants
nothing but to dwell within the maze forever, and so
he wanders to the center of the maze again. At this
point, his other personality takes control and the cycle
repeats: go near the exit, go to the center.
Neither aspect of Aischros knows about the other.
However, the continual wandering has proved deeply
confusing and unhinging, and he is even angrier than
other Minotaurs. It’s still possible to reason with him,
however, especially if one convinces his escaping half
that they can help him get out.
How he might ultimately leave his fate is up to the
gamemaster, and could make a good story, especially if

he knows the location of a valuable treasure from long
ago. However, those who would seek to aid Aischros
should beware; his unaging is tied to the ground of
the labyrinth, and leaving it would cause him to age to
dust within minutes unless that aspect of his longevity
could be counteracted.

often require many braces and supports, and
typically have crumbly, cavelike ceilings and walls.
Those made of harder material — like Grubba’s
mine system — can be much more solid, almost
resembling the stone walls of a castle.
Finally, nature likes to play tricks on miners,
putting all kinds of obstacles within the mountain.
For example, diggers might discover some harder
rock that cannot be easily mined, or a chasm that
extends under the currently dug mine. If these
uncertainties can be worked into the design of
the mine, then the architects often do so. Alternatively, the dangers may need to be sealed oﬀ,
such as a mine shaft that opens into a chasm; it’s
a brave or foolhardy explorer who pokes around
past any hallway that has been speciﬁcally blocked.
(In fact, I’ve heard of one mine system that had a
demon down a blocked-oﬀ section, trapped within
a simple chalk circle.) In extreme examples, it may
be necessary to close or even evacuate the mine
— sometimes quickly! This is especially true when
underground sources of water are discovered; a
thin wall between a mine and a river can collapse
the entire tunnel system.
There are a few other points to keep in mind
when considering mines.
Mines are three-dimensional. In addition to
moving left and right, mines can slope up and down.
Those mines that use wheeled mine car mechanisms
(which themselves require charioteering abilities)
take every eﬀort to ensure that the slopes are as
gentle as possible, but that’s not always an option,
especially when obstacles within the mountain force
an alternate path. (Tunnels with mine cars also try to
have gentle turns, since even a moderately fast-moving
car can tip over when it hits an overly sharp corner.)
Mines are dark. Obviously, being underground
means that there’s no natural light. Human mines tend
to have lanterns, while those made by humanoids with
ultravision or infravision often have little or no light
sources, which can be very disorienting to those who
need such things.
Mines are a group eﬀort. It’s an exceptionally
foolhardy miner who digs alone, since so much can go
wrong: ceiling collapses, pockets of poisonous gas, and
accidents can trap someone within a mine, doomed
to starve to death or worse. As a result, miners are
usually accustomed to working together and helping
one another.
If I was writing a tale set in a mine shaft, there
are a number of tacks I could take. First, if there was
anything mysterious or unusual buried in the earth,

miners would usually be the ﬁrst ones to ﬁnd it ... or
deal with it. Second, a mine would be a perfect place to
set a rescue mission. It’s entirely possible for a person
to be accidentally (or intentionally!) lost within an
unsafe mine, and it could be a real challenge to rescue
someone in that situation. Finally, miners can be very
insular and suspicious of outsiders, and if there was a
secret hidden within a mining community or information that only they possessed, it might be very diﬃcult
to get it from them; the easiest way would probably to
become a miner for a period, enduring the dangers of
the mine to get closer to them.
But, mostly, mines are a good way to keep Grubba
from getting too anxious as we go from one overland
journey to another.

of recruiting: “Become a traveling holy minister and
make your friends jealous of all the fantastic places
you’ll visit!”)
The abbot, a jovial round-faced older man
named Brother Nyll, informed me that this
particular monastery was fairly small, capable of
supporting 10 monks — 20 if they installed bunk
beds. (“Monk bunks?” I volunteered helpfully.
Okent elbowed me in the ribs.)
Raichael and Brother Nyll needed to discuss
business, so I took an opportunity to investigate
the monastery. I was done in what seemed like ﬁve
minutes, although it might have been six. Abbeys
and monasteries, I realized, are places where the
devoted go to escape the distractions of worldly
trappings. As such, anything that isn’t necessary to
the base needs of living is devoted to the clearing
of the mind or the deepening of faith.
In fact, even some things that are necessary for
living have a decidedly diﬀerent bent. For example,
the Order of the Highest Sun has (logically) the
sun as its central focus. As such, they work the sun
into many of the sundries of life. For example, they
don’t have a ﬁreplace. Rather, a ladder leads from
the kitchen to the roof, where a highly polished
huge shallow metal bowl collects the sunlight and
focuses it, giving the heat necessary to boil water,
cook, and so on. (I asked Brother Nyll what they
did on those days when the sun didn’t shine. “Pray
harder,” he said, betraying a slight smile.)
The chapel is the focal part of the abbey, serving
as the physical reminder of the monks’ spiritual
lives. This particular chapel had a beautiful stained
glass ceiling, which allowed the sun to enter in a
blinding and glorious display, especially when it
loomed high overhead.
The lay brothers made their residences in two
types of chambers — small and large, although
even the “large” ones still made me feel slightly
claustrophobic. All chambers consisted of an
uncomfortable bed, a simple wooden box that
served as both a night table and storage, and a
candle. The abbot’s chamber was a little bigger
and contained a shelf with numerous scholarly
books and religious artifacts.
The dining room had barely enough room for
10, so I deduced that, should the monastery ever
have more residents, they would need to eat in
shifts or make other arrangements. The kitchen,
while functional, deﬁnitely served to reinforce a
life free of material distractions. The storeroom
contained enough supplies that, fully stocked,

Other Places

• 81

could feed 10 for four months (assuming relatively
light eaters and that their nearby well would continue
supplying water). For most of the year, the brothers
kept their supplies much lower, with the supplemental
space used for their crafts.
What crafts? Well, many monasteries are selfsuﬃcient, and as such they will often have crafts or
artistic products that they can use to make money.
Common crafts or talents include book or manuscript
scribing, cheese making, and making wine or beer.
(Speaking from ﬁrsthand experience, I can say that
some monasteries make a truly divine brew.) Basically,
anything that requires a lot of patience, skill, and spare
time — but not constant supervision or work — is a
good candidate for a monastery. Alternatively, if it’s
something that requires a lot of eﬀort, then the act
itself can be worked into the spiritual regimen of the
monastery, such as melodic chanting. Scribing is also
common in this regard because spending hour after
hour writing is a great way to reﬂect on one’s soul.
The Order of the Highest Sun has an unusual craft:
mirrors. Feeling that mirrors reﬂect the radiance of
their divine inspiration, the Order creates some of the
most breathtaking mirrors I’ve ever seen, made from a
durable, highly polished metal. They receive the metal
elsewhere, cut it into shape outside, and polish it at
the dining room table while ritually praying for hours
on end. (I’ve heard of some places making mirrors out
of silver-backed glass, but they are much more fragile,
and aren’t as free of warping as polished metal. Trust
me — glass mirrors will never prove common.)
So what’s there to do at a monastery? Well, if you’re
a monk, the answer is obvious: Pray. These institutions

serve as places of spiritual solitude, away from the
distractions of the world. When I asked Brother Nyll
what they hoped to accomplish, he replied, “To keep
the sun shining bright.” It’s a place for those who feel a
yearning to a holy life but who do not feel they have the
calling to be a leader within the faith. They pray for the
good of their order, their believers, and — ultimately
— the world. I postulated that the faithful have their
communities strengthened by having these places as
part of their fold. Brother Nyll chuckled and said, “And
the existence of the faithful strengthens ours.”
For those who do not belong to a monastery, there
are still opportunities for improving one’s well-being,
either physical, mental, or spiritual. Monasteries are
often home to people skilled in healing arts, so they
can be an ideal place to rest and recover. Such ministrations aren’t free — especially if one isn’t a member
of the order’s religion — although most monasteries
will heal those who seem at least somewhat aligned
to their goals for Moderate Funds (a gold piece or two
per day). Of course, if a person were poor and in dire
need, it seems unlikely most monasteries would turn
him or her away, at least for a night.
Monasteries are also great sources of information.
In some regions, they remain the primary (or only!)
means of duplicating documents, manuscripts, and
books. Given how rare and precious a commodity their
lore can be, almost all monasteries require those seeking
knowledge to gain permission of the abbot (and possibly
even higher up in the religious hierarchy, depending on
what is sought). Regardless, it will usually be Diﬃcult

Ruined Castle’s

Looking for clues
within the ruins, we discovered a few points of
interest. Grubba stroked
his long beard and asked
if he could poke through
the ruins on his own.
We assented, and the
dwarf wandered oﬀ in an
expression of absolute
glee (which is to say, he
was scowling less than
normal).
After searching
for a time, we found
what seemed to be the
remains of the throne
room. Any valuable trappings had long since
been destroyed by the
elements or looters, but
it still exuded the regal
style as typiﬁes royalty.
After some more examination, we found a collapsed secret door which led to
the castle’s dungeon.
There are some general misconceptions among
commoners about typical castle dungeons. The normal
vision is a sprawling, vast complex, replete with dozens
of chambers and corridors, containing prisons, supply
rooms, and so on. This is generally wrong for a number
of reasons. First, any kind of under-earth burrowing
is hideously expensive; unless there’s a speciﬁc reason
for doing so, a castle’s underground construct, if it
exists at all, is likely to be modest. (Of course, plenty
of castles are constructed by those with a less-than-full
grip on reality, which can be reason enough for making
a sprawling dungeon.) Second, sprawling underground
prisons are rare beneath a castle. Prisoners scarcely ever
warrant the expense of building a dungeon; in fact,
in most kingdoms they seldom warrant the expense
associated with feeding them. Wrongdoers in most
kingdoms are punished by ﬁnes, banishment, or death.
Occasional short-term public humiliation (such as a
public cage or stockade) may serve for those who need
to be taught a lesson by brief imprisonment.
Regardless, the only folks you want to seal beneath
the earth in a full dungeon are those who are too dangerous to set free or too valuable to let go. Political
prisoners most commonly frequent dungeons, although
those who know valuable lore (especially of an arcane
nature) might also be found there.

The ﬁnal reason there aren’t more sprawling castle
dungeons is that it presents a security risk. A moment’s
thought will reveal why: If you’re building a thousand-ton castle on a spot of earth, digging beneath
the foundation is a good way to ensure your castle
becomes ruins. (In fact, if an enemy castle does have
such a dungeon, it’s possible that an adventuring party
might be tapped to play the role of sappers against it,
sneaking into the dungeon and weakening the ceiling
to help invaders take or destroy the fortiﬁcation.)
Because of all these reasons, most dungeons beneath
castles — if they exist at all — are small ... “hole-in-theground” tiny. The normal purpose of the dungeon is
the short-term holding of a small number of prisoners
(no more than four, kept in two rooms of two people
each, although only having enough space for two — or
even one — is common). Soldiers usually guard above
such tiny dungeons at the sole entrance.
However, this castle’s ruined dungeon was an exception, being somewhat more elaborate than the typical underground hole. It seems this dungeon served
primarily to imprison and interrogate; the entryway
opened into an antechamber which led to 12 prisoner
cells, each sealed with a lock that would take Moderate lockpicking ability to thwart. The doors consisted
of stout wood, with grated openings to peer in and a
slot at the bottom to give food. We weren’t interested

son that any number of secrets might be housed in
those cells, either in the form of gear the prisoners
managed to hide on them, or else in messages or lore
hidden within. I’ve heard of one prisoner who carved
an elaborate enciphered text on the inside of his cell
using a fork, over the course of his months of captivity;
the guards never new because they never bothered to

ﬁlled the air as we moved quickly through here. There
was a door similar to those blocking the cells between
the torture chamber and the prison antechamber, and I
realized that this probably let the interrogators control
whether or not the other prisoners heard what they
were doing to their fellow inmates.
This chamber had a thick, sealed door that would be
Diﬃcult to open for anyone lockpicking it. We weren’t
able to penetrate the door’s defenses, but peering
through the keyhole I realized it was a weapon closet
of some sort; apparently this dungeon also served as
a secondary defensive measure for the castle. The door
had to be nearly impenetrable in case the prisoners
escaped, so they couldn’t arm themselves. (There might
also be untold treasures behind that door — or maybe
just an angry skeleton tapping its foot impatiently.)
Finally, the torture chamber opened up into a little
meeting room, with a small table and chairs. Upon
closer examination, I
realized the walls of
this room were lined
with cork — apparently
to keep prying ears
from hearing what’s
going on amid those
who gather here. (It
wouldn’t surprise me
to learn the walls were
ensorcelled to prevent

as well.) Apparently
whoever owned the
castle above reveled in
secrets, both extracting
them from others and
keeping them himself;
given the phenomenal

alone, I can only guess
that these secrets were
more than paying for
themselves.

• Chapter Three

As we were ruminating about the implications of
this dungeon — and what secrets might still be hidden within these chambers — we heard an armored
ﬁgure rapidly approaching. Drawing our weapons, we
turned around ... only to spot Grubba coming at us full
tilt, gasping. “Short of breath?” I asked our diminutive
friend, causing him to draw his axe and stagger tiredly
toward me. Okent interceded and Grubba, grumbling,
told his tale. “I found another underground cavern
system. In investigating, I learned there lurks some
kind of inhuman presence there. They have sensed our
presence here, and are clawing at the earth separating
their caves from this dungeon. We need to get out of
here now!”
Never needing incentive to run from a ﬁght, I led the
way out of the castle’s dungeon. I can only hope that
any secrets that might still remain buried weren’t so
important that we should worry about them falling into
hostile hands ... or needing to wade into those enemies
in a future eﬀort to retrieve this lost lore.

the diﬃculty of scale. When you are standing next
to these ruins, you can’t fathom them, seeming like
nothing more than odd stone formations. From afar,
however, you recognize them for what the are — the
creations of an intelligent mind. Of course, you don’t

that distance provides. I’ve heard tale of one adventuresome gnome who spent all day scaling an odd jagged
column he discovered in a valley — only to get to the
top and ﬁnd that the bottom of his “mountain” had
toes, and he was atop the broken statue of a leg.
The Ancients lived a long time ago. The most
long-lived races are deeply disquieted by the realization
that intelligent beings exist outside their collective
memory. (Frankly, anything that adds to the discomfort
of Elves makes my heart glow a little warmer.) Regardless, everything we know about them comes from these
ruins. There are no books, writings, crystals that glow
with illusory messages — nothing. Mind you, the discovery of such artifacts would be a breathtaking ﬁnd,
and no doubt be a treasure that people — or nations
— would kill for.
We don’t know what happened to the Ancients.

us pause. What could cause a people so advanced to

Should that idea ﬁll us with hope and

In investigating the ruins, we encountered a band of
travelers from this region. By their long robes painted
with strange runes taken from the rubble of this area,
we recognized them as the Ruin Nomads. (I should note
that this is a name bestowed upon them by outsiders;
their name for their people is “Cotushan,” while an individual is “Cotusé.” My pedantic nature notes that “Ruin
Nomad” is an oxymoron; the ruins aren’t that common,
and they spend most of their time wandering outside
the area of the Ancients. However, they deﬁnitely claim
the ruins as their birthright, and it would be an unwise
idea to tangle with them over that claim.
Some of the smartest minds of the lands have put
their minds to the task of unlocking the secrets of these
ruins, and I’m more than happy to steal their ideas.
The Ancients seem Human or humanoid. Given
how the primary evidence of their existence stems from
gigantic statues, this would appear to be an obvious
observation. However, there are two problems. First,
we don’t have a full example of their statuary; we have
pieces. It’s possible they had, say, gargantuan tentacles
extending from their abdomens (or something equally
alien), but that those representations in their statues
have long since broken oﬀ and eroded away. Second,
there is the problem of scale. The Ancients — whoever
they were — did nothing half-baked. For those of you

Stone Circles

I’d always believed that there was a point of wetness beyond which one could eclipse; for example,
a rock thrown in a lake became as wet as that rock
could get. After days of trudging through the nonstop
downpours of that cold island nation, I realized I was
wrong, and considered jumping in a nearby lake in an
eﬀort to dry oﬀ.
I emphasize the gloom and dreariness because is
the only reason we hadn’t seen the stone circles before
almost literally smacking into them. Sure, in most situations a group of stalwart adventurers should spot a
large collection of ﬁve-meter-tall stones on ﬂat land,
but it was raining. A lot.
We knew this location bore further investigation,
so we made camp, using a giant stone as a brace for
our tents.
We awoke the next morning to the commanding
voice of a man dressed in leather and furs, arranged in
ornamental strips radiating from a thick gold ring in
the center of his chest. He exuded authority and power.
“Who dares to deﬁle our sacred site?” he demanded. I
pointed to Okent.
I knew the fur-wearing man had to be powerful,
because his presence marked the ﬁrst time it wasn’t
raining since we got to this land. Raichael, using her
divinely inspired charisma, quickly smoothed the situation and kept Okent and
the fur-clad warriorpriest from striking
anyone. The holy man,
who referred to himself
only as “Precursor to
the Perpetual Falling
Land,” served about
three dozen men and
women as both secular
and religious leader.
This group lived in the
foothills, in a cavern system containing enough
bolt-holes, traps, and
hidden ambush points
to made us thankful we
didn’t discover their
community the previous night.
The Precursor (as I
called him, lacking the
desire to devote more
ink than necessary to

his full name) was not a pleasant man, and it seemed his
hospitality sprang mostly from the fact that he hadn’t
found any reason to kill us yet. However, his reluctance
in talking about his people did not extend to his faith,
about which he was more than willing to explain.
Unfortunately, his explanations just didn’t make
much sense. His people seemed to believe in the notion
of falling. When they sacriﬁced animals on the main
altar stone, the blood ﬂowed into the earth along with
its spark. They contend that the world’s spark — and
all life — stems from within the earth, from whence
it is renewed and where it shall return. All aspects of
their beliefs stem from this idea of falling: The sun
doesn’t rise, but rather the earth falls each morning,
its momentum carrying it away enough to give the sun
reason to itself in turn fall back into the earth. They
claim that lava and natural springs are the land’s soul,
proof of the essence that shall fall into it. “After all,”
he explained, “when our blood ﬂows from us, we turn
cold; our warmth has descended into the ground, from
whence it shall come again. Lightning strikes, bringing
ﬁre to what it touches. The ﬁre, too, will ultimately die
down, to fall into the earth.” It made my head hurt.
(Raichael later explained that our confusion stemmed
from the faith’s antiquity. Their ideas were born at least
two Human Ages ago, perhaps even older. They had
only rudimentary ideas of community and faith, all
centered on the stone circle. They didn’t even believe

seemed to be the remnants of Human-made
valleys, long overgrown, that seemed to
support my idea.) But he just frowned at the
prospect. “All things fall. The rain. The overripe fruit. The newborn calf. This circle. All
things have fallen into place as they should.
And it falls to us to ensure the cycle.”
I asked what he meant, and he seemed reticent. Raichael coaxed him, and we learned

Uses for Stone
Circles
Stone circles represent a convenient plot hook for all manner of
stories; since their immediate use isn’t obvious, anything that seems
reasonable can become the focus of a plot. Some ideas include:

• The site of a spell or miracle
• The only means of creating or destroying an object of
great power
• A means of teleporting to another location or opening a
gate to another dimension
• A way to decipher an ancient formula or celestial calculation
Of course, these ideas can be combined; perhaps a villainous
necromancer has calculated the perfect time for his grandiose
undead creation ritual via a stone circle, and a band of heroes
needs to use the same circle to forge a weapon that can defeat
this new nightmare army.
Traditionally, stone circles are associated with astronomical
phenomena, such as the ability to track or predict the movement
of heavenly bodies. They have also been the cite of various spiritual
and religious movements, usually involving pagan beliefs.
Stone circles represent the ﬂip side of the coin presented by
the Ruins of the Ancients. While the Ruins symbolize a mystery
from ages long past standing apart from humanoid accomplishments, a stone circle is a long-lost mystery that could be created
by people, given suﬃcient resources, time, and dedication. As
such, while the Ruins of the Ancients are probably never able to
be fully understood within a fantasy campaign, stone circles can
theoretically be deciphered and their secrets utilized. Of course,
what inﬂuence such secrets would have on the world is up to the
gamemaster.
The eﬀect of a stone circle on miracles and magic depends on
the rarity of the circle and the conditions under which it can be
activated. In most circumstances, unless stone circles are very common, they will qualify as “extremely rare” or “unique” components,
and thus count as a -6 or -7 Negative Spell Total Modiﬁer (see the
D6 Fantasy Rulebook, page 91). In addition, if the spell or miracle
can only be used in the stone circle at a certain time, this counts as
an Other Condition, worth -3 for daily events (sunrise or sunset),
-4 for a seasonal eﬀect (equinoxes or solstices), -5 for an annual
event, and -6 for an event only occurring every few years or rarer.
See the D6 Fantasy Rulebook page 94 for more information.

this spectacle was being played out on
a display larger than any I’d ever imagined possible by Human hands.
The sun eventually rose higher, ending its breathtaking display. But for at
least a day afterwards I found myself
believing instead on some level that
the earth had fallen into place under
the sun. Our group remained another
day, and I noted that the sun’s display
was not repeated the next morning
within the stone circle (although it
was still beautiful); whatever we were
observing, it was obvious that it only
worked on certain days a year.
I found my mind divided. On the
one hand, there was no miracle here,
per se; nothing we had witnessed
could not be explained beyond mere
tricks of the stones’ placement. On
the other, these stones were huge,
and each weighed more tons than I
wanted to consider. Could Human
minds have understood how to position these stones to account for this
display? Also, the stone only fulﬁlled
its seeming primary function a couple
days a year at most; this leaves little
room for trial and error. (“Hmm.
Nope, that wasn’t spectacular enough.
Hey, Thadius! Help me move those 10ton stones a few ﬁnger-widths to the
left and we’ll try again!”) This stone
circle either stood as a monument to
a near-dead religion that sprang from
wisdom we cannot fathom; or else it
was crafted by Human minds, pointing to a former glory and expansiveness of intellect the likes of which we
no longer possess. Or perhaps both
are true.
It rained the day we left.
Seven months later, we found ourselves in a dark and twisted land over
a thousand kilometers away from that
monument. If grass and forests ever
grew there, if there were ever people,
if there were ever birds or bugs or any
sign of life, then no evidence remained
beyond the dried, decaying posts of
once-mighty trees dotting the muddy
landscape.

90
After countless miles of trudging through this bleak
region, we came across a ﬁve-meter-tall stone, which
— we soon discovered — formed part of another
stone circle. However, this circle was in disarray,
with stones overturned, broken, or missing entirely
(although the indentations remained where these
stones once stood).
All indications pointed to the fact that the calamity behind the land’s death lingered far in the past,
although we couldn’t determine exactly what happened.
Regardless, as we ﬁnished surveying the remains of
the circle, we reached a conclusion: This circle was an
exact duplicate of the one we had already visited, save
for its ruination.
And that conclusion led to questions: Could that
warrior-priest have been telling the truth when he said
that he and his followers were keeping the world alive?
And if so, what would happen if his devotions were ever
disrupted, his faith shaken, or his circle damaged?

Temple

In our travels, we investigated hundreds of temples.
Sometimes, it was because Raichael had been asked to
by her order; sometimes, it was out of curiosity or a
desire to explore; sometimes, it was to patch up our
wounds. Although there are as many types of temples
as there are religions, most temples have the same (or
similar) features.
Above all else, temples exist to serve a religion and
its community. For any belief system that has been
around for more than a few years, almost no aspect of
its temples is designed by accident; the layout, shape,
size, color, and appointment of temples generally reﬂect
its dogma and symbolism.
Here are some features we’ve found in various
temples.
Narrow corridors might represent that the precepts
of its faith dictate everyone must ultimately go to visit a
deity one at a time after death. Conversely, wide open
areas might signify that community is exceptionally
important to the religion.
A temple may have many windows, both to provide
light and to expose its members to the glories of the
natural world. Or it may have very few, because the
religion demands that its community not lose focus
by distractions of the outside world.
Food might be presented or sacriﬁced at a temple.
Fruits and grain products such as bread are the most
common oﬀerings (to be collected and eaten by the
clergy or — especially in open-air temples — eaten
by animals or left to rot). Animals are generally sacri-

• Chapter Three

ﬁced, the blood often gathered to represent purity or
impurity, depending on the faith. (However, at least
one religion we witnessed had a touching ceremony
where the priestess describes how they are about to
celebrate their faith with the struggling, ﬂustered dove
before her ... only to release it just before plunging a
dagger into the wooden altar top. The dove’s escape
to the open skies represents the faith’s triumph of
mercy and forgiveness over humanity’s base desires
to kill and deﬁle.)
The most important element of almost any temple
is the altar, here deﬁned loosely as the focal point of
the faith’s prayers and devotions. The altar is where the
faith’s community leader directs the prayer services.
While it’s possible to have a temple without an altar
of some kind, in practice we’ve only seen this twice. In
one, ﬁve clerics address the congregation while standing
against each wall of the pentagonal temple. In the other,
taking place in a near-pitch-black temple, the priest’s
sermon took place from amid the congregation (the
acoustics made it diﬃcult to discern where, exactly, he
was). At the midpoint of the ceremony, he performed
a miracle that summoned a ball of light; this hovering
ball became the focal point of the mass.
Unlike monasteries, temples are devoted to the
greater needs of larger groups of the faithful. As such,
they generally have a gathering area of some kind;
this is almost always by the altar, usually containing
seats, pews, or benches for the faithful to sit, kneel, and
stand. Alternatively, some temples have special mats or
other portable seating arrangements. In general, these
gathering areas are usually the most richly appointed
and adorned sections of the temple.
In addition to one or more formal gathering places,
temples often have other contemplation areas
where the faithful can visit to pray, meditate, compose
their thoughts, or the like. These can be sections of the
main gathering area (such as a shrine to a lesser but
still important deity or prophet), other rooms within
the temple, or even separate buildings or locations
on the temple’s grounds. These places run the gamut
from ornate to plain, although they almost never have
as many resources devoted to them as the altar or
main gathering area. I hesitate to say they are “worse”
because that’s an aesthetic judgment; I’ve often found
my (admittedly weak) spirituality more kindled by
these simple, tasteful shrines or rooms than I have by
the ostentatious temple center.
To be honest, even if an element does seem incidental,
the religion will usually come up with some justiﬁcation as to why it is such. “We enter the temple from the
west because ... er, that is the direction of the sun’s set-

Other Places

ting, and our illumination begins
where the world’s light ends. And
the large ﬁre in the antechamber
represents the purifying love of
our ... no, wait. That’s not supposed
to be there. Run!” (More seriously,
incense is used in some temples to
mask the aroma of sweaty farmers
... although the faith might incorporate this real-world necessity
by pointing out the smoke rises
to the heavens like the spirits of
believers.)
Most temples have on-premises
clerics, monks, deacons, or the
like, and as such must provide
living quarters for them. Depending on the region, religion, and
relationship with local nobles or
community, these holy people
may also be charged with the
defense of the temple in the event
of attacks; if not, then there will
presumably be knights or trained
militia citizens marshaled in that
situation. (In case it’s not obvious,
these arrangements exist because
temples are usually the ﬁrst target
of an attack on a community, owing to the wealth most
temples have on their premises; statues, ornamentation,
or dressing that are considered sacred to the faithful are
merely seems gold and silks suitable only for reselling.)
Of course, these measures assume that a region knows
the threat of invasions. While this is usually the case,
our group encountered one temple in a remote region
that had never known warfare or invasion, so they had
absolutely no concept of the notion when we visited.
(All the while we were there, I kept saying to myself,
“Please don’t be invaded while we’re here. Please don’t
be invaded while we’re here ...” Fortunately we weren’t
... although, in hindsight, it would’ve made a pretty
exciting story if that had happened.)
Finally, most temples have ample storage, whether
for seasonal adornments, ceremonial garb for the holy,
or other odds and ends. There’s generally little noteworthy about such areas. However, our group once found a
temple that promised its followers a means of directly
interacting with their god; after some investigation, we
discovered a gearwork assembly in a store room that
controlled a giant “talking” visage above the altar. (I’m
generally skeptical of any miracles that require constant
lubrication.) If a temple has any signiﬁcant stores of

treasure, they’ll usually be kept in a locked or guarded
vault room or other heavily protected area.
The Nyg-Fa Temple of the Fa’ayn belief (translating to
“truth” in their language) illustrates both the commonalities and individuality of these places of worship.
The Nyg-Fa Temple has a traditional altar; in this
case, it’s made out of top and bottom layers of basalt
with an outer ring of bamboo. Locked within this
bamboo “cage” is a plant with broad blue-green leaves
and tiny yellow ﬂowers. In talking with the Temple
Elder, Raichael learned that this plant is a Gar-Fa (“the
growing truth”). All Fa’ayn temples contain one of these
plants, and according to their traditions, all these plants
are descendants from the original Gar-Fa created by
Fana’ayn, their faith’s beautiful druidic founder. In fact,
this plant is so sacred to them that living specimens are
only permitted to be within Fa’ayn temples, although
a leaf from the temple’s specimen might be presented
to a particularly devout member or family on a special
occasion. (No doubt, should a temple’s Gar-Fa become
endangered, the Temple Elder would go to great means
to ensure its recovery and safety.)
Nyg-Fa’s followers bring thin, soft mats made from
richly dyed green ﬁbers. Over the course of their thrice-

92
weekly religious services, followers go from sitting
crouched on the matt to kneeling to standing with their
arms over their heads — simulating the “growth” of
the followers as part of the community.
The Nyg-Fa temple has two meditation areas. The
ﬁrst is adjacent to the ceremonial hall and is lined
with beautiful wood carvings depicting the religion’s
tenants; so ﬁne is the line work and artistry that it’s
possible to miss seeing them the ﬁrst few minutes
you’re within the chamber. (For a donation of a few

silver, the Temple Elder will provide parchment and
charcoal for people wishing to make rubbings of a
particular engraving. Given the beauty and intricacy
of the etchings, this could well be a bargain ... and I
swear I saw something resembling a map in one of
the pieces.) The second is an elaborate garden that is,
according to the Temple Elder, exactly 360 steps from
the rear entrance of the garden — one for each degree
of the circular sun, “from which all good life ultimately
springs” (or so says the Elder).
Although not universal, temples are often centers of a community (for believers, at any rate).
The purpose and structure of this center depend
on how popular, universal, and strong the faith
is within a community. In a township with many
rival religions, these gathering sites might be small
and intended primarily as a meeting spot before
services. In communities with one primary religion,
however, these sections of the temple can be large
and elaborate, serving the role as a gathering spot
to keep the community strong. Of course, how much
the community uses these areas depends also on
how spiritual the people are in the ﬁrst place. In
several communities, we’ve seen solitary temples
with large antechambers almost awash in dust, with
uncaring citizens bustling around it.
Such a fate has not befallen the Nyg-Fa. The
temple enjoys the status of belonging to the secondmost prevalent religion; as a result, its people are
a vibrant community, especially among farmers.
This temple has two adjoining rooms. Three times
weekly, one room is used for small meetings of select
groups, and once a week, both rooms are used for
gatherings after religious services.
Like most religious living quarters, those of the
Nyg-Fa are pretty spartan. There are two rooms
— one for the Temple Elder and one shared by the
two neonates. Their proximity to the altar means
they are the ﬁrst line of defense for the temple,
although in the event of an emergency, the Elder’s
only duty is to retrieve the Gar-Fa and escape
— usually out the back exit.
The Nyg-Fa storage facilities are mundane, containing nothing more than spare mats, ceremonial
garb, food, and other items necessary for formal and
informal functions. It has no “hidden” wealth to speak
of, although the temple uses a fair amount of gold
(actually gold plating) throughout, since they see a
symbolism between gold and the rays of the sun.
While Raichael was debating metaphysical
nuances with the Temple Elder, I found myself
wondering what other sorts of events might hap-

pen at a temple. To be sure, “evil” temples (those who
worship dark gods, evil forces, politicians) have been a
staple of literature for quite some time, not to mention
a constant thorn for do-gooders of this world.
Of course, most of the story possibilities of the
monastery apply to temples as well. They are very
similar buildings, except a temple serves the needs
of the faithful public while monasteries tend to its
private holy people.
It’s possible that a group might have to inﬁltrate such
a place, perhaps to recover information or ﬁnd a secret
lurking within. While it’s usually nice to be diplomatic
and polite, some religions are more insular than others,
and it’s not always possible to even see those in power
at a temple. For example, one palatial house of worship
we encountered had as a precept that its High Priest
was unapproachable. Unfortunately, we had learned
that an assassin had tricked her way within the temple
and was planning on killing the High Priest. (If this
had happened, the region would likely have plunged
into turmoil.) Denied any direct means of warning the
church, we had no choice but to inﬁltrate it ourselves;
we eventually found and stopped her, but it was nerve
wracking for a while.
Many temples have a policy of “sanctuary” — those
seeking asylum within such a temple are protected
from the secular law by staying within. In theory,
those who receive sanctuary are expected to live by the
moral code of the religion; they have, in eﬀect, been
given freedom from secular authorities in exchange
for obeying the church. In practice, many unscrupulous people have used this asylum in the past merely
to escape prosecution, hoping to ﬂee from the church
— and justice — later.
Temples often provide services to the community,
such as healing, research, or access to holy items.
Sometimes these are only furnished to members of the
religion, but often they will be given to others if the
need is great or if they feel that doing so might persuade
someone to join their faith. Some temples just don’t
care, and oﬀer their services to anyone willing to meet
their nonbeliever prices. This is most common in wartorn or conﬂicted regions where showing favoritism
would be tantamount to choosing sides, which could
prove devastating to weak temples.
Finally, visiting a temple can be a deeply moving
event for the faithful; those who are devoted to their
causes can ﬁnd themselves refreshed, and even those
who aren’t particularly religious can ﬁnd themselves
rejuvenated by watching the simple act of those believing in what’s right doing what they can to express their
belief and commitment to those ideals.

As an aside, I note that it’s also possible for people to
be in conﬂict with a religion, yet neither side being “evil,”
as we think of it. For example, if two temples exist in a
town, and one preaches restraint and self-denial while
another celebrates the openness and freedom of alcohol
and casual interactions, then these two will probably
be in conﬂict. Neither is “evil” (per se), although both
would probably view the other as misguided. (But if the
head of the temple cackles maniacally and expresses
conﬁdence in his ritual to allow a venomous god to
snuﬀ out all life in the world, thus sating primal dark
appetites ... well, you should stop that person.)

Fa’aya
Those who follow Fa’aya (or the Fa’ayn Path, as
it is otherwise known) believe in the holiness of its
founder, the druid Fana’ayn. Although upholding the
sacredness of life as most other druids do, she asserted
that everything has the potential for divinity through
the process of growth. She taught that all good things
grow, and that the only criteria for the divine is they
do not stop “growing.” (One of her ideas most often
scorned by other religions is that stars are actually
akin to the sun, and similarly divine; the light from
these orbs has merely “grown” outward inﬁnitely, and
reﬂect in the night sky visibly as a result.) Because of
this faith, followers of Fa’aya believe in healthy growth
in all things; whether growing mighty oaks, erecting
high towers, expanding the mind through learning,
building muscles, or raising tall and healthy children,
Fa’aya teaches that all growth and expansion is proper,
holy, and a way to achieve divinity.
Fana’ayn’s most remarkable deed came during the
most incredible drought and pestilence seen in the
region for centuries. As crops withered and thousands
died from illness and hunger — and with the threat
of even greater death looming — Fana’ayn convinced
everyone in the village to replant their crops, requesting that, in the four corners of their ﬁelds, they should
plant clippings of her own plant. These crops grew just
enough to feed the region, even without minimal water,
an abbreviated growing season, and fewer skilled farmers than normal. Once the plants were harvested, all of
Fana’ayn’s clippings withered and died, despite their
having been left in to grow out of respect; in fact, all
clippings of this plant in the world supposedly died.
The only plant to survive was Fana’ayn’s original one.
This became known as the Miracle of the Gar’Fa, and
all Fa’ayn temples supposedly contain oﬀspring of this
original plant, although the fate of that ﬁrst plant is
unknown.

aversion and prejudice against those who
avoid the sun, especially Humanoids such
as Dwarves who are shorter than Human
average (who, their precepts argue, “have
stopped growing because they have turned
their backs on light”).

This miracle ignites the fallen branches and leaves of a
typical forest. Such burning is common and necessary to
ensure the healthy growth of normal forest, by allowing new
trees and plants have access to sunlight. A side eﬀect of this
miracle is that those who are within such clearing areas ﬁnd
themselves burning as well, making this a popular oﬀensive
spell to otherwise paciﬁstic naturalist clerics.
This miracle can only be used once for any given ﬁve-meter
area radius, because the underbrush fueling the ﬁre burns
away, not to be replaced for a decade or so. Although taller
trees are scorched a bit by this miracle, it does them no lasting
damage, and there is no danger of starting an uncontrollable
ﬁre via this invocation.

At present, there is a slight schism within the community; a splinter sect, calling themselves Fa’aya Engar
(meaning “grandiose truth”), has taken Fana’ayn’s mandate to grow to also mean weight. Many members of
this sect are thus phenomenally obese. Fa’aya’s oﬃcial
position is that this is not “healthy growth” as mandated
by Fana’ayn; the splinter sect counters that, according
to Fana’ayn, all growth is healthy and holy. The outcome
of this ideological conﬂict is uncertain.
Fa’aya is a religion favored by farmers and cosmopolitans alike; anyone devoted to the concept of growth
— whether it’s tending crops, expanding a mercantile
empire, learning new languages and philosophies, or
designing castles — is welcome. Their sworn enemy
is entropy and war of all types. They teach a mild

• Chapter Three
Clerics of Fa’aya
Clerics of Fa’aya with access to Miracles
almost universally prefer the favor extranormal skill, since ideas of growth most
often correspond with those of aiding the
world or others. The second most common
is strife; this surprises many, who assume
that skill’s destructive capabilities are antithetical to the ideals of growth. While this
is true, smart Fa’ayn clerics realize that to
make something grow it’s often necessary
to destroy or cut it; for example, cutting circular open wounds into a square enables the
body to heal much faster. The least common
is divination; it is diﬃcult to directly justify
many aspects of this skill, since Fa’ayns do
not dwell in the past and they also believe
the future is what a person grows toward.
Still, some clerics realize that learning is a
step of personal growth and can often work
divination miracles that lead to a greater
growing good.

Required Aspect
Gesture (-2): Making something
seem to grow (fairly simple). This is most
commonly accomplished by making a ﬁst
and then opening it, palm up; the ﬁngers
are “growing” outward. However, there are
variations: curling into a ball and standing
upright, and so on. One Fa’ayn cleric who was bound
and held captive in a prison cell was able to invoke a
miracle by puﬃng out her cheeks.
Recommended Aspects
Gar’Fa Leaf (-5): Every year on the spring equinox,
all fully vested clerics of Fa’aya receive one leaf from
their temple’s Gar’Fa leaf. This is the most powerful and
sacred holy symbol of the Fa’ayn, and is irreplaceable; if
a cleric loses it or has it destroyed, he must wait until
the next equinox to receive another. In dire straits, a
Fa’ayn cleric can have the component become consumed
at the end of invoking a miracle; this destroys the leaf
but imparts an additional -5 aspect modiﬁer (see “Components” on page 91 of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook).

Other Places

• 95

Incantation (varies): Prayer to Fana’ayn or exaltation on the power of growth. This is most often a -1
modiﬁer (for common mantras such as “Good stems
from growth” and “Sun, I reach for you”) although it can
rise as high as -6 (for reciting, from memory, Fana’ayn’s
“Sermon of the Fresh-Cut Gar’Fa”).

Treacherous
Straits

I have come to believe that the gods created urgent
needs and dangerous straits at the same time, for surely
one cannot exist without the other.
I reached this conclusion aboard a rickety ship I had
won us speciﬁcally for this occasion in a high-stakes
mumblety-peg game. Raichael’s order had charged her
with delivering supplies and medicine to a coastal city
that was ravaged by a recent war they had no direct
involvement in. The onset of a plague had made their
situation particularly dire, and time was of the essence.
So, naturally, the only way to get there promptly was
through the Serpent’s Maw Straits, a route usually
exclaimed by agitated soldiers as a curse.
One of the ﬁrst observations I had when approaching
the straits was recognizing I could no longer hear the
omnipresent creaking and groaning of our own ship. I
realized after a moment this was because of the deafening roar of water, circling in chaotic patterns around the
vessel, the jagged rocks, the coastline — everywhere.
Shortly thereafter, the captain bellowed that turning
around or changing course was no longer an option.
“What about a horrible death?” I oﬀered, helpfully.
Once within the straits, there are two possible roles
for all those aboard a vessel. The ﬁrst is to obey the

• Chapter Three

captain as if your life depended on it ... because it does.
The ship almost seems alive, with ropes ﬂailing and
sails spasming. It falls to the people aboard the ship
to keep it under control, making sure lines are secured
and any damage is repaired or its impact minimized.
(A broken railing can mean death, both from sailors
ﬂying overboard and from additional impact and damage from the railing debris.)
The other role in this situation is to wait; if you don’t
have the skills to help, or if you freeze under pressure,
you’re a liability, both to yourself and to others. So your
only options in this case are to watch and feel helpless;
or hide, not watch, and feel helpless.
Work yourself to death, or wait to die. It’s debatable
over which role is more diﬃcult.
I had chosen to wait because, outside of composing the dirges that might be sung at our funerals, I
felt impotent (although I was not yet at the point
of observing my stomach’s contents, as Grubba
was). But after we were about a third of the way
through, I heard the sounds of panic from the aft of
the ship. I drew my short sword and sprinted up from
the cabin, only to see a tentacle ﬂailing and grabbing
at crewmen.
During the course of the battle, I also found myself
entangled by one of the tentacles, being lifted high
in the air. An unfortunate glancing blow knocked my
sword out of my hands, sending it to the straits below.
Panicking and having few other options, I reached into
my belt sack and pulled
out the ﬁrst item I could
ﬁnd — the sharpened
quill I use for writing.
As the monstrous beast
drew me in closer to
its maw, my desperation helped my quillequipped hand into one
of the beady eyes of the
monster; it squealed
in pain and confusion,
ﬂinging me backwards
into the water. I could
also hear the sound of
the other men being
dropped safely aboard
deck. Clearly, in some
situations, the sword is
weaker than the pen.
The churning foamy
straits sucked me under
almost immediately.

Rules for Navigating Straits
Straits have a base diﬃculty and a scale range.
The diﬃculty is the minimum pilotry roll the ship’s
captain makes when navigating through, all things
being equal. The scale range is the range of ships’ scale
values that can navigate through at this diﬃculty. The
lower end of the scale range represents the smallest a
ship can be before being tossed around by the chaos
of the straits. The large end of the scale represents
the largest a ship can be before running afoul of
the outskirts of the straits. For each point outside
of the scale range, the pilotry diﬃculty is increased
by 3. (The gamemaster can decide that ships of a
certain size are impossible to sail through a strait
at all; a gargantuan war galley won’t ﬁt through the
Needle’s Wrath, no matter how good its captain is.)
If the captain is successful with her pilotry roll, a ship
passes through the straits successfully. If this roll is
unsuccessful, one die of damage is dealt to the ship
for each point the roll is missed by.

While it was only a Moderate challenge to my swimming
abilities to make sure I inhaled enough air before being
pulled under, it was much more Diﬃcult to ensure I
swam against the pull of the water. Perhaps guided by
instinct, luck, or the tides, I found myself emerging

making successful pilotry rolls at the same diﬃculty of
the pilot’s. For every ﬁve points these supplemental
rolls are made by, the captain may add one to her roll;
this bonus cannot exceed half the diﬃculty (rounded
down), no matter how many people help.
Example: Captain Nick is piloting his small galley
Thinker’s Bell (scale value of 14) through the rough
and narrow Straits of Mattenkelé. These straits have
a base diﬃculty of 15 and a scale range of 6–13. The
Thinker’s Bell has a scale one greater than the upper
range of the straits, so his diﬃculty is 18 (15 + 3).
The ship’s 20 crewmembers each roll their pilotry
diﬃculty (against a diﬃculty of 18); those who roll
a 23 add 1 to Captain Nick’s roll, those who roll 28
add 2, and so on. The maximum bonus the crew
can provide is +9 (18 divided by 2). If Captain Nick
failed his pilotry roll by 5, then 5D damage would
be dealt to the ship.
The gamemaster may decide that there is a certain
level of crew involvement required to keep the ship
aﬂoat, and he may determine that a certain number
of crew members need to succeed their supportive
pilotry rolls. If this threshold is not met, the captain
suﬀers a -1 penalty to her roll for each person below
this threshold.
Example: The Thinker’s Bell needs at least six
helpful crewmembers to get through the Straits of
Mattenkelé. If at least six of the 20 crewmembers
didn’t roll an 18, then Captain Nick suﬀers -1 for
each crewmember short (up to a maximum -6
penalty).

from a large pool inside a wondrous grotto, the walls of
which were lined with a glowing phosphorescent moss.
The most immediate treasure this cave contained was
air, and my staccato breaths ﬁlled my thankful lungs.
As my eyes adjusted, and I found there were remains

98
of long-departed Human life here — the wreckage of
a small boat, which had apparently been damaged and
sucked under to this cave by the straits. Seeing the four
clothed skeletal bodies lying here, I couldn’t help but
think of myself and my own friends; the possibilities of
an adventuring party being trapped here both frighten
and intrigue me.
A thin beam of light trickled from above, and I concluded that it would take a Heroic climbing feat to get out
of here; even then, I wasn’t sure where I would emerge
in the outside world (no doubt one side of the straits
or another). However, a suitably skilled craftsman or
tinkerer might have been able to rig a device or contraption to escape, especially using the remains of the ship;
I guessed crafting such a device would be Very Diﬃcult.
And, of course, one appropriately trained in the arcane
arts could possibly ﬂy or levitate one out of here.
As I explored the cave, trying to ﬁnd a means of
escape, I came across a sealed but unlocked chest.
Opening it, I saw an impressive cache of treasure,

• Chapter Three

including a dagger and amulet that seemed to glow
with mystical might. Atop it all was a rolled scroll, old
but still treated with care; obviously its contents were
important. My hands drew toward this discovery, when
I heard sounds behind me.
There, from the pool of water, emerged the second
most beautiful woman I’d ever seen. She beckoned me
closer with long, slender ﬁngers, and I found myself
leaving the treasure to go to her. Meter by meter, I was
drawn toward her. As I drew tantalizingly close to her
lips, she smiled ...
... and cuﬀed me upside the head, rendering me
unconscious.
I awoke back aboard our ship, with Raichael tending
the bump upon my head. (I wish I could say this was
the only time I’d been knocked out by a woman, but
that’s another tale.) The waters were calm now, as our
vessel had made it through the straits. Apparently,
Raichael had prayed for aid, and her deity provided it
in the form of a Mermaid. When I asked how the Mermaid was able to transport me
back, Raichael responded, “She
swam ... and probably breathed
into your mouth a couple of
times.” I groaned; “A heavenly
beauty’s lips upon mine, and I
was unconscious for it?!”
I have no way of knowing
what that treasure was, or
how to get back there. But
I couldn’t help but wonder:
Where were those travelers
going with those items? Their
ship was obviously too small
to survive the straits. Was that
scroll a map or a letter, perhaps
indicating how and where the
amulet and dagger were to be
used (or even destroyed)? If
the failed legacy of this group
becomes important, how would
anyone else brave the straits to
ﬁnd them?
As we sailed on to our destination, I pondered our harrowing
journey. Why someone would
want to risk traveling through
dangerous straits? Some techniques I might use in my own
tales include:

When faced with a problem that seems truly
insurmountable, divine aid permits the cleric to
petition her deity to deliver someone (or something)
most able to help resolve the crisis. Invoking this
miracle summons one or more nearby living beings
to the cleric; the capacities of this aid depends on
how well the miracle is invoked.
Upon successfully invoking this miracle, the
result points are multiplied by 2; this total is
then divided between values for eﬀect (either the
target’s mettle or weight — whichever is greater)
and duration, as per the tables on page 87 and 88
of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook; remember that mettle
requires one result point per pip, and three result
points per die.
Example: Raichael invokes divine aid and rolls a
24. This is 13 more than divine aid’s diﬃculty of 11,
so 26 points (13 times 2) are divided between the
eﬀect and duration; the gamemaster decides that

a secluded area. (This would especially be true of an
archipelago or lone island. Of course, this island would
have to be pretty special to risk life and limb.)
• Reduced risk — it’s possible such dangerous straits
could represent the safest route to an area.

a nearby Mermaid, with a mettle of 4D (value of 8)
will help Raichael for one hour (value of 18). If the
deity (and gamemaster) determined that an owl
(with a mettle of 3D) would better serve Raichael’s
needs, then the creature would help her for 2.5
hours (value of 20).
This miracle does not summon the being instantaneously; instead, it must travel under its own
power to the invoker. This travel time is deducted
from the duration given to the creature. When it
arrives, the invoker must explain its needs to the
creature; the miracle automatically “translates”
the invoker’s requests. The summoned being will
follow the cleric’s desires fairly closely; although it
will not seek to “trick” the invoker, it also won’t go
beyond the reasonably narrow bounds described
by the invoker.
If multiple beings are summoned, each mettle
eﬀect must be paid for separately, although the
duration is only paid once. For example, summoning two Mermaids for one hour would require a
roll of 28.
As per the limitations of the favor skill, divine
aid can only be used for nonoﬀensive interventions. Creatures summoned to protect someone
or something else could attack in self-defense but
under no circumstances would they attack a target
ﬁrst or cause other destruction (even if for a good
cause). Another miracle — called divine retribution
— is similar in almost every way, except it uses strife
as its skill; those summed via this miracle can only
be commanded toward destructive, retaliatory, or
oﬀensive purposes.

• Fewer supplies — although time may not be of
the essence, in shipboard journey, the need to carry

• Danger-seeking — okay, I confess; surviving the
voyage through the Serpent’s Maw was one of the most
thrilling experiences of my life. It’s possible that people
might track down such experiences just to gloat that they
did so and survived. It might also be a challenge provided
by a bored, eccentric nobleman or a crazed wizard.

Designing
a Maze

Now, I was supposed to write about how to make
dungeons and mazes and the like. Unfortunately, I
wouldn’t know how to do that if my life depended on it;
really, the most complicated thing I know how to make
is a mead blinder. (One-half mug of mead mixed with
one-half mug of rum; shake vigorously; drink; shake

monk who owes me a favor. It looks right and has lots
of pretty maps, but beyond that I haven’t read a lick of
it. If you want to read more about my exploits, you’ll
need to skip ahead a bit.

Types of Mazes
Whether it’s the hedge maze of a dryad, the catacombs of a sinister cult, or the mines of a Dwarvish
king, the thought of roaming through twisty corridors
is a staple of Fantasy games.
There are three broad categories of maze-like structure: planned, constructed, and natural.
Planned maze-like structures have their entire
purpose deﬁned from the beginning, and its entire
layout and design is carefully considered. A labyrinth
is probably the most common example; the builders
of a maze must know both the entrance and exit, as
well as any desired stops along the way.
Constructed maze-like structures are constructed
by their ﬁnal form was not envisioned by anyone. However, its structure is still manufactured by intelligent
minds, or else intelligent minds had an active hand in
its development at some point. Mine systems are the
classic example; those who burrow into the earth seldom know the exact shape of their ﬁnal construct, but
instead build new shafts as they discover new resources
or encounter diﬃculties. A confusing mansion would
be another instance, if the basic house had extension
after confounding extension added on, resulting in
disoriented explorers.
Natural maze-like structures are entirely unplanned;
their confusion stems not from any active desire, but
the random formations of natural processes. Ancient

• Chapter Three

underground caverns caused by water ﬂow and erosion
are the most classic and obvious examples, but treacherous mountain passes or paths carved by roaming animals
through overgrown forests would be other cases.
A maze-like structure can consist of more than one
type. For example, a planned dungeon beneath a castle
might have a branch that leads oﬀ to a series of constructed mine shafts; during the construction of that
shaft, the miners may have stumbled onto a natural
cavern system. As another case, a planned labyrinth
built long ago might have collapsed into confusing
ruins, resulting in a dungeon where parts retain their
original planned organization while others are merely
constructed; some parts might even have collapsed or
overgrown so fully that they are indistinguishable from
a natural formation. Finally, a natural cavern might
become inhabited by demihumans, who transform it
into a constructed habitation.

The Maze’s Purpose
Although some gamemasters have the urge to pick
up a pencil and graph paper and start plotting a maze
or dungeon immediately, more satisfying results can
occur if some simple preparations are made.
First, the most important idea to keep in mind when
conceiving of or designing a maze-like structure is: Why
does it exist? Most such locations are wildly expensive
and diﬃcult to construct, and would almost never be
undertaken lightly or randomly. (Of course, natural
locations have the advantage that they can just exist;
no further justiﬁcation is necessary ... although then
the gamemaster should carefully consider why players’
characters would want to explore them.)
There are many reasons a maze-like structure could
come into being:

• To keep something safe (for instance, valued prisoners or a paranoid noble)
• To hide something (for example, a powerful magic
item or weapon)
• To honor something (usually a ruler or somebody
of incredible wealth and power, or else a loved one of
such a person)
• To provide amusement (such as a hedge maze, or
coliseum puzzle)
• To keep something from escaping (such as a monster
or cosmic entity)
• To provide housing (especially subterranean
dwellers)
• To access valuable resources, usually through mining
(generally precious metals or jewels, although Fantasy
games can have other types of resources)

Other Places

• 101

• To provide a challenge (for example, a
maze used as a culture’s Rite of Adulthood,
or a Trial of Champions used to judge one’s
guilt or innocence)
Of course, multiple techniques can be used
for a single place. For example, a group of
goblins might live in a cavern system. When
a respected warrior died, they dug a multiroomed tomb for her body as an adjunct to
the main caves. When their shamans captured
a wicked Djinn that slew many of their kind,
they sealed it in another addition to their
caverns, hoping to ensure its evil could never
escape.
Or a maze-like construct might have had its
purpose changed or modiﬁed. For instance, a
temple might originally have been designed
to honor a fallen hero, but an evil priest who
worships an opposed god might have taken
it over and turned it into a twisted mockery
of the tomb.
Finally, it is possible for a maze to have
no purpose at all; fantasy tales are ﬁlled with
stories of those who have succumbed to madness and built strange, inexplicable structures.
However, even in this case, the gamemaster
should probably know the source of both
the builder’s resources and his madness.
(Fortunately, the same powerful beings that
can inspire such madness are often eager to
supply their new minions with the resources
necessary to further their insane goals.)

Left Isn’t
Always Right
Everyone knows that if you just keep hugging the left (or right)
wall, you’ll eventually ﬁnd your way out of a maze, right?
Not necessarily. Although it’s a good general strategy, it’s
by no means foolproof. In particular, it’s possible for a mazemaker to make one or more “islands” within a maze. If the
object is to get to a central area, then following one wall will
entirely miss it.
For example, an adventurer who enters the simple sample
maze below and follows the left wall will do a clockwise circuit of
the dungeon, completely missing the treasure in the center.

End

Start

Organizing
the Maze
Once the gamemaster knows the reason for a maze’s
existence, he can begin building and populating it. The
most obvious place to start is the “central” chamber or
purpose of the construct. For example, a dungeon primarily intended as a prison will need cells for captives,
interrogation facilities, and so on. An under-earth vault
designed to guard a precious jewel would probably be
best created with the treasure chamber ﬁrst, adding
additional rooms outward from there.
From there, the next logical addition is any support
rooms or structures necessary for the central room (or
rooms) to fulﬁll its purpose. For instance, both the prison
and the treasure vault will require guards. However, if
the prison only leads to one central exit point, then
these guards probably don’t reside under the earth,

instead posting watch at that exit point. However, the
vault will probably have full-time guards, and they will
thus need to be supported.
Continuing these cases, both the prison and vault
would have supply areas for guards (although the
prison’s supply closet would probably be more heavily
secured, to keep escaped prisoners away from weapons).
The vault would also have living quarters and feeding
facilities for its guards.

Adding Encounters
At this point, the gamemaster should have a fully
functional underground setting, fulﬁlling its primary
duty. However, it’s pretty bland. To mitigate this, add

• Chapter Three

102
anything that would be interesting to the map which
would serve as additional encounters for the players’
characters. In a fantasy setting, these can break down
into two broad categories: realistic and fantastic.
Realistic encounters are those that would be plausible in the “real” world. For example, perhaps the prison
is owned by a noble who likes interrogating captives
himself; if so, it stands to reason that the noble might
have a private room to question prisoners. This room
might have a secret exit to an area belonging to the
noble (such as his private chamber or oﬃce); this could
present players’ characters an alternate way into — or
out of — the prison. Likewise, the vault might contain
an enormous pit in front of it, calling for a drawbridge
or other device to access it. This could require either
ﬁguring out how to operate the mechanism (requiring a devices roll) or a jumping or acrobatics roll to get
across.
Fantastic encounters are those relying on elements
of a fantasy world — usually magic, miracles, arcane
lore, or resources that just aren’t practical in a realistic
setting. For example, the dungeon might employ a pair
of Oni to serve as supplemental guards; these invisible
one-eyed giants would prove quite a surprise to those
who assume an empty corridor to be unguarded. Or
the vault might be guarded by a Djinni, who uses her
magic and shape-changing abilities to confound those
who would steal the treasure. (Oni and Djinn are both
detailed in D6 Fantasy Creatures.)
Magic can also augment otherwise mundane locations. One room of the dungeon might be enchanted
so that anyone who touches the ﬂoor without special
runes on their boots will set oﬀ an alarm (either
silently alerting guards or sounding piercingly loud
to disorient those breaking in or out). Or the treasure
vault might have a trap room that activates against
anyone of Human size who enters without saying the
password, shrinking them to the size of mice; then
dozens of cats are released into the room!
Within the context of the game, these constructs
should be large enough to provide appropriate challenges for however many adventures the gamemaster
deems appropriate; a prison escape is probably only
worth an evening’s worth of fun, while recovering a
valuable treasure might take several sessions.
Within the context of the game universe, the size
of the construct should depend on the purpose of the
project as well as the resources of the builders. For
instance, a prison that’s designed to hold an enemy
princess for decades would be much more elaborate
than one designed to hold the noble’s hooligans for
a couple days.

All of these techniques also apply to natural mazes
and dungeons. Instead of starting with the “reason” for
the dungeon’s existence, start with the most prevalent
natural phenomenon. As one case, a large underground
river would probably form a central area, with additional
caverns branching oﬀ from either side. This might lead
to aquatic beings constructing chambers within those
caverns for their dry land needs on one side of the river,
and an underground humanoid race taking up residency
on the other side of the river. Other parts of the cavern system might contain traps that the two peoples
have placed to ensure the other doesn’t encroach on
their territory; these could be mundane and magical
traps and encounters. All that would be necessary for
an adventure is, for example, an important person
to become lost in the caverns, requiring the players’
characters to ﬁnd him; soon the rescuers are trying to
survive two diﬀerent tribes as well as various natural
and artiﬁcial threats within this cavern system.

Creating the
Maze Layout
Although most constructs can be abstracted, mazes are
one of the few where having a ready map is helpful.
First, decide how big you want the maze to be. Graph
paper is very useful, and a pencil is a must. Draw the

entrance and the exit (if they are diﬀerent places). Then
draw any areas where explorers will want or need to
visit. (See “Choosing the Size.”)

Designing the
Correct Path
Out

From there, draw the “correct” route through the
maze, being sure to connect all the ancillary locations
along this path. (See “Designing the Correct Path.”)
Finally, draw oﬀ-shoot paths from the correct
route, making sure to close up any of these side
treks so they don’t present an alternate means
of thwarting the maze. It’s also possible to place
alternate rooms within these dead-end routes,
giving additional encounters for those who are
oﬀ the beaten path. (See “Finishing the Maze
Layout.”)

Random
Dungeons
This is a system for designing a maze with little
advance notice. Of course, the gamemaster can
also choose what seems interesting, and is free
to ignore any result that doesn’t make sense.
First, ﬁgure out the purpose of the construct.
Roll one regular die and consult the “Dungeon
Goal” table.

Next, decide where the construct by rolling one
regular die on the “Dungeon Location” table.

Then, decide how many “rooms” the dungeon
should be, and draw a grid of that size. At this
point, ﬁgure out the number of “active” encounters and the number of “empty” (or nonencounter) rooms. Both of these will determine how
long the adventure takes, although the number
of active encounters is much more important.
Depending on the gaming group’s style of play
and the number of players, a good rule of thumb
is that every three encounters will take about
one hour, assuming a ratio of one combat, one
skill resolution situation, and one roleplaying
encounter. Combats take the longest, especially
with more players. Roleplaying encounters are
shorter, and skill resolution situations are usually the shortest.
Connect the rooms in the maze using the
“Creating the Maze Layout” tips. In general, these
“mazes” will be much simpler than traditional
mazes, consisting of several dozen squares. However, the technique is the same: Determine the
entrance and exit, craft the one true path through
the maze, and build other “dead ends” around it.
(In a typical dungeon, it’s common for there to
be more than one true path. However, make sure
there’s at least one! In addition, check for and
eliminate any “shortcuts” that can let players skip
large portions of the scenario.) In this system, the

104
“last” room is the one that fulﬁlls the function of the
construct or the adventure. For example, if it’s designed
to keep a powerful monster locked in, then the last
room would contain the monster; if it’s an underground
community, then the last room would contain the city
ruler who must be defeated or the goal that the city
ruler has commanded them to complete.

• Chapter Three

As an option, generating the maze can be skipped
until after determining the encounters if it would be
easier to build the maze around them.

Example
A gamemaster has been coerced by her players to run
a three-hour adventure with no notice. She decides on
a 25-square dungeon (a ﬁve-by-ﬁve grid), with
nine encounters. Upon rolling for the purpose
of the construct, she rolls a 6; she rolls again,
and gets a 2 and a 4: It’s designed to keep something in, as well as a test or amusement. Next
she rolls to determine where the construct is.
She gets a 3: It’s above ground.
She decides on a simple spiral pattern,
beginning in the lower left-hand corner and
progressing to the center (see “Example Maze,
Figure 1”).
She then decides where the encounters are
and numbers them accordingly (see “Example
Maze, Figure 2”).
Next, she formulates the back story of the
adventure. Centuries ago, a wise priest came
into possession of a powerful weapon. Realizing it would be wrong to destroy it, or even
keep it hidden away forever, he instead ordered
a temple constructed that would serve as a
means of protecting the weapon and determining who should be worthy to receive it.
Note that the mazes generated in this
method are not “to scale”; they are merely
meant to represent the layout of the construct.
Thus the example temple could be a square, but
it could also be long and rectangular, circular,
rising and falling over many heights, and so
on. All that’s really important is to determine
that encounter 1 leads to 2, 2 leads to 3, and
so on. (In fact, it’s possible to construct a
dungeon of this sort without needing to draw
anything; the gamemaster merely needs to
keep track of information as words on paper
or in her head.)

Encounters
For each encounter, the gamemaster should
decide what type of encounter will be generated,
or roll one die (not a Wild Die) and consult the
“Dungeon Encounters” table on page 106.
The most common combination is “combat”
and “roleplaying.” This represents a creature
that can be fought but might also be rea-

Generating combat challenges is one of the
most challenging aspects of a gamemaster’s job,
and is not one that can be easily summed up here.
The gamemaster is encouraged to look through
D6 Fantasy Creatures to determine appropriate
encounters for her gaming group, adjusting
combat skills, damage dealt, and Body Points
or Wounds to make suitable encounters for
the players’ characters. Generally, beings found
closer to the end of the maze should be tougher
than those at the beginning of adventure.
To get a randomly generated combat encounter, use the “Combat Encounters” sidebar on page
106. Any character or creature can be used in a
combat situation by simply altering the combat
skills, damage resistance, weapons, and Body
Points/Wounds. Additionally, a “more powerful
than players’ character” result could indicate a
large number of weaker opponents rather than
a single character with higher skill scores than
the players’ characters.

soned with. However, it’s possible for all of them to
be combined in various ways. Combining combat and
skill resolution might mean a combat in an unusual
environment requiring skill rolls; alternatively, it might
represent a skill resolution that, if failed, will lead to

To generate an encounter requiring skill
resolution, ﬁrst roll one regular die (not a Wild
Die) to decide on the number of skills necessary
to resolve the situation. Compare the result to
the “Number of Skills Needed” chart in the “Skill
Resolution Encounters” sidebar on page 107.
Next, referring to the “Skills Used” chart, roll
one die (again, not a Wild Die) to determine
which attribute is most appropriate to resolve
the encounter. Then, to ﬁgure out which skill is
most suitable, roll another regular die (or two
if Acumen is the indicated skill). When two or
more skills are listed, the gamemaster may pick
whichever one she wishes.
Finally, determine the challenge level to
resolve the situation for each skill by rolling 2D
(again, without a Wild Die) and comparing the
total to the “Challenge Level” chart.
Whether any detrimental eﬀects are suﬀered
by the entire party or just the person who failed
the skill result is up to the gamemaster.
Note that this challenge level can be adjusted
depending on the overall skill level of the players’
characters. For example, an experienced party with
many dice above normal starting characters might

Example 1: The gamemaster generating the
sample temple determines some skill resolution
options. On her ﬁrst roll, she gets a 4 (indicating
two skills are required). For the ﬁrst skill, she rolls
a 2 (Coordination), a 3 (lockpicking), and a 7 (Moderate). For the second skill, she gets a 6 (Charisma),
a 6 (mettle), and a 4 (Easy). She decides that this
encounter room has a mysterious locked door with
a well-constructed complex key lock (lockpicking
diﬃculty of 14, as per the D6 Fantasy Rulebook,
page 79). Opening the door causes a loud magical
scream that has to be shut oﬀ by destroying a magical crystal in the center of the room. Because of
the noise, approaching the crystal requires an Easy
mettle roll; the crystal, she decides, is as tough as a

have all of their ﬁnal diﬃculties (not the
roll on the table) raised by 5; thus a roll of
6 — indicating an Easy encounter — might
have a ﬁnal diﬃculty of Moderate (which is,
coincidentally, Easy +5).
The eﬀects of failing the skill challenge,
if anything, should depend on what kind of
encounter the gamemaster devises. Some
good common ones include:
• Damage (roll 1D to determine the number
of dice of damage done)
• A hindrance (for example, a wound that
temporarily reduces Move; a knee injury that
adds +2 to acrobatics, jumping, and running
diﬃculties, and so on)
• A curse (Bad Luck or Achilles’ Heel is especially appropriate, although Infamy can also
indicate characters “marked” in some way)
• A loss or damaging of gear, weapons, or the
like (such as acid splashing on armor, causing
it to be degraded or destroyed)
Whether or not these are permanent should
be up to the gamemaster, although eﬀects
that forever alter a character (such as a curse)
should be considered very carefully, generally restricting application to those whose
abilities need to be limited lest they become
too powerful.
Now the gamemaster needs to decide
what this collection of random skill resolution numbers means (again, feeling free to
discard any results that she can’t make ﬁt
or don’t inspire anything). See the “Example
Skill Diﬃculties” chapter from the D6 Fantasy
Rulebook for ideas on what various diﬃculty
levels might represent.

of 1D and requires 10 points of damage (see
page 69 of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook).
Example 2: The gamemaster’s dice are
feeling frisky and generate some odd results.
On her ﬁrst roll she gets a 6 (indicating three
skills). For the ﬁrst skill she rolls 3, 1, 11:
a Very Diﬃcult lifting task. For the second
she gets a 2, 1, 7: a Moderate charioteering
or pilotry roll. For the last roll she gets a 1, 3,
4: an Easy contortion roll. Putting her thinking cap on, the gamemaster decides that the
chamber opens into an unusual challenge: a
wheeled vehicle at the top of a steep incline,
which leads down to a ramp that leaps over
an impossibly wide and deep chasm. Those
who investigate this vehicle will note that it
seems to be the only way to cross the chasm.
The vehicle has a very sticky, stubborn brake
that needs to be released before the chariot
will move; this is a Very Diﬃcult lifting task.
Once the vehicle is moving, it will take a charioteering roll to maneuver it into place so it will
optimally jump the chasm. Finally, the vehicle
needs to be stopped on the other side before it
crashes into a wall, but the brake engagement
mechanism is buried deep within the vehicle!
It requires an Easy contortion roll to squirm
one’s hand to engage the brake.
Of course, once the gamemaster devises
a “skill resolution” encounter, it’s entirely
possible for there to be other solutions to the
problem. For example, the runaway chariot
might be controlled in midair by a player’s
character with ﬂying, and the players’ characters might use devices to ﬁx the brake or
jumping to get to safety. Nevertheless, this
system is designed to give a basic idea for
thinking up a skill-resolution situation.

Roleplaying
Generating an encounter that calls for
roleplaying is challenging and requires more
ingenuity to make it satisfying for the players. Nevertheless, here is a quick system to
get ideas.
First, roll one die to determine which of the
two tables “Most Appropriate Skill” charts in
the “Roleplaying Encounters” sidebar to roll on.
Then roll a second die to determine which of the
six skills below each table is most appropriate
to resolve the encounter.

• 109

Next, determine the strength of those being interacted with by rolling one die and checking the result
against the “Strength of Those Encountered” chart.
This roll can also represent the number of individuals
encountered. For example, a roll of 1 might indicate a
lone puny goblin who’s eager to talk, while a 6 might
indicate a well-trained party of goblins, led by a powerful shaman who’s willing to negotiate.
Finally, determine the base mindset of the encountered person (or persons) by rolling one die and comparing the result to the “Attitude of Those Encountered”
chart.
“Friendly” doesn’t necessarily mean “willing to help
a character,” but is generally a person prone to seeing
things the players’ characters’ way. Likewise “Hostile”
doesn’t necessarily mean “will attack any moment,” but
indicates an individual who likely views the players’
characters as a threat, a nuisance, or lunch.
Again, discard any results that don’t make sense or
are too diﬃcult to work into the encounter. For example,
a dungeon that’s populated entirely by undead might
make it diﬃcult to justify a Friendly encounter. On the
other hand, maybe the this result can be interpreted as
a lost Human child within the dungeon. (Or maybe the
gamemaster is inspired by the thought of the players’
characters encountering Ted the Happy Zombie ...)
Use all this information to generate a skeleton of a
roleplaying encounter, then add whatever feels interesting. Note that the “appropriate skill” is not intended
to be used as a skill roll to resolve the scene (unlike the
Skill Resolution Encounter system earlier); rather, it’s
designed to suggest a starting point where that skill
would be appropriate. Of course, the skill could be used
to replace the roleplaying encounter if the players aren’t
interested in roleplaying.
Example 1: The gamemaster rolls a 1 (indicating the
skill will be chosen from the ﬁrst table), a 4 (indicating that intimidation is the most appropriate skill), a 5
(indicating the encounter is stronger than the players’
characters), and a 3 (indicating the encounter is Neutral
to begin with). The gamemaster decides that a Sphinx
is in one of the chambers of the temple, giving a test of
courage. He will be increasingly more belligerent and
will eventually attack. However, he will back down if
treated in an antagonistic nature; if the players’ characters forcefully indicate they deserve the treasure,
and they won’t be stopped by the likes of the Sphinx,
he will smile and commend their spirit.
Example 2: The gamemaster gets a 5, 4, 2, 5: a hostile
encounter with someone who’s the same strength as
the players’ characters where streetwise is the best skill
to use. The gamemaster decides that an assassin has

gotten trapped within the temple, unable to progress
further or escape. The assassin will try to trick the players’ characters into thinking that he’s a noble ﬁghter
and would be a good asset to the group. The assassin
will ride the group’s coattails in hopes of passing the
test and getting the powerful weapon; regardless, at
some point he will betray the party when it best suits
his purposes. If the players’ characters are streetwise
(although not necessarily using the skill), they will
note that the stranger is not what he seems, and can
deal with him accordingly.
Example 3: Earlier, the gamemaster rolled a 6 when
determining the encounter type, indicating more than
one. She then rolls a 5 and a 4: both a roleplaying and
skill resolution will be necessary to resolve the situation.
For the skill resolution part, she rolls a 2, 4, and 7: a
Moderate marksmanship task. For the roleplaying part,
she rolls a 5, 5, 1, 1: A friendly, weak encounter where
trading is the best tactic to take. The gamemaster decides
that a Flying Cat lurks in the temple; she possesses the
password necessary to bypass a future encounter safely.
The Cat is bound by oath to protect one particular room
of the temple, but she wants a mouse from another
part; she’s willing to trade the password for a plump,
tasty mouse. The mice like to hide in the high parts of
the temple, and the easiest way to get them is by using
marksmanship to shoot them with a ranged weapon. Once
they get the mouse, the Cat will reveal what she knows
and the players’ characters can move on. (Of course, they
could also think of a better way to get mice, or even tell
the Flying Cat to take a walking leap, hoping to resolve
the future encounter on their own.)

Encounter Tips
If using this system, the constructed place should
be building toward the “ﬁnal” room, which fulﬁlls the
purpose as deﬁned in the ﬁrst roll. In general, the ﬁnal
encounter should be of a type that’s most satisfying for
the players. (For example, those who like roleplaying
may need to trick or persuade someone in the ﬁnal
room to resolve the adventure; those who like skill
resolution may need to do impossibly diﬃcult things
to succeed, and so on.)
Additionally, the last room should be the most diﬃcult
challenge within the dungeon, and it’s appropriate to
require many rolls; extensive roleplaying, problem-solving, or negotiation; or a lengthy combat to win the day.
It’s a good idea to design this ﬁnal encounter to require at
least one Fate Point to be spent by the players’ characters,
and possibly more depending on their skill level.
The gamemaster should make sure that treasure,
clues, and other rewards are sprinkled throughout

110
these randomly generated dungeons, ensuring that the
players get incentives to continue investigating.

Premade Rooms
Gamemasters looking for other ideas can roll on the
following table. This roll can either be used to supplement or replace one of the earlier rolls, as desired. To
use this table, roll two dice: a regular die and a Wild Die.
(The Wild Die is not interpreted as a Critical Success or
Critical Failure, but is instead just used to diﬀerentiate
between the two dice.) The Wild Die is read as the ﬁrst
die and the regular is the second. Thus, rolling a 3 on
the Wild Die and a 2 on the regular die would mean
looking up the “Regular Die = 2” paragraph under the
“Wild Die = 3” section.
Each selection provides a broad outline for an encounter or challenge. The speciﬁcs (such as diﬃculty, an
explanation for the area’s existence, or limits on use)
are left up to the gamemaster.

• Chapter Three

Wild Die = 1
Regular Die = 1: The players’ characters get some
kind of tangible insight to a future encounter within
the construct, such as a scroll or riddle.
Regular Die = 2: Movement is restricted in some
way. Perhaps there is molasses or oil on the ﬂoor, or
maybe a spell forces the players’ characters to move
more sluggishly.
Regular Die = 3: There is a secret door in this room,
which requires a search roll to ﬁnd.
Regular Die = 4: The way the players’ characters came
from is suddenly blocked oﬀ (although the way forward
is still open); this requires them to force that way open
again or ﬁnd another exit out of the construct.
Regular Die = 5: A fountain, pool of water, or other
source of liquid enhances the skill of the ﬁrst player’s
character to drink from it. Figure out which skill by using
the “Skill Resolution” system herein. This bestows a
+1D bonus for the 1D hours or the duration of the time
within the construct, whichever
comes ﬁrst.
Regular Die = 6: A fountain,
pool of water, or other source of
liquid decreases the skill of the ﬁrst
player’s character to drink from it.
Figure out which skill by using the
“Skill Resolution” system herein.
This bestows a -1D penalty for the
1D hours or the duration of the time
within the construct, whichever
comes ﬁrst.

Wild Die = 2
Regular Die = 1: This room or
section of the construct contains
a personal tie for one the players’
characters. For example, maybe a
Patron or Contact is tied up in a
cell and must be escorted to safety,
or maybe the a player’s priest
character ﬁnds a scroll containing information of value to his
religious order.
Regular Die = 2: Circumstances within this room force
the players’ characters to establish
camp for the night. Maybe they are
overcome by a spell that induces
sleep, or maybe the dungeon they
are exploring is so big that they

Other Places

• 111

need to rest. Regardless, anyone who travels without
food or other essential supplies might ﬁnd themselves
unhappy.
Regular Die = 3: This room contains an exit to
another construct (such as a portal to a maze, a stairway
down to another dungeon level, and so on). Whether or
not to follow it will be up to the players’ characters.
Regular Die = 4: Circumstances aﬀect the players’
characters weapons, such as a room with a ceiling
too low to use normal hand-to-hand weapons, or a
room with explosive kegs where missed shots with an
arrow could prove disastrous. This forces the players’
characters to be inventive, ﬁnd alternate weapons, or
do without weaponry.
Regular Die = 5: Circumstances aﬀect the players’
characters armor, such as a room with a deep pool that
would make it dangerous to wear heavy armor, or a
hallway that’s too narrow to use a normal shield. This
encourages the players’ characters think creatively, ﬁnd
alternate armor, or do without protection.
Regular Die = 6: Circumstances aﬀect the players’
character other gear, such as needing to walk through
a waterfall to progress onward (which could aﬀect
water-permeable spellbooks or scrolls). This forces the
players’ characters to ﬁnd a means of protecting their
gear or do without those items.

Wild Die = 3
Regular Die = 1: A treasure of indeterminate value
that’s much too big to be easily carried is located here
(such as a giant golden statue). This could test the
players’ characters ingenuity and determination. The
item might be as valuable as it appears or it might be
worthless.
Regular Die = 2: A section of wall with valuable
information is here, such as hieroglyphics or magical
lore. It may not be immediately useful to the players’
characters, but it should be of interest to someone.
Figuring out how to acquire and transport this information is up to the players’ characters.
Regular Die = 3: One of the characters’ Disadvantages is triggered by this room, such as any Allergies,
Environmental Incompatibilities, or Quirks.
Regular Die = 4: One of the characters’ unusual
Special Abilities proves useful here, such as Elasticity,
Glider Wings, or Omnivorous.
Regular Die =5 A creature or object that is obviously too big for the construct is within this area (such
as a huge Dragon within a large room where the exits
are a meter wide).

Regular Die =6 A supernatural means of healing is
in this chamber, such as a fountain, a compassionate
druid, or the like.

Wild Die = 4
Regular Die = 1: The characters’ sight is hampered
in some way. For example, the room might be ﬁlled
with smoke or unnatural darkness. Penalties can be
assessed for any rolls requiring vision.
Regular Die = 2: The characters’ hearing is hampered
in some way. For example, a continuous ringing gong
may make normal conversation impossible. Penalties
can be assessed for any rolls requiring hearing.
Regular Die = 3: The characters’ smell, taste, or
touch is hampered in some way. For example, decaying
corpses might make scents impossible to distinguish,
or an aerial poison might make touch less sensitive
(which, among other things, would make lockpicking
diﬃcult). Penalties can be assessed for any rolls requiring the sense.
Regular Die = 4: Something aﬀects the characters’
scale, making them larger. This can aﬀect the characters’
ability to get through doorways, pick up objects, or get
to certain places.
Regular Die = 5: Something aﬀects the characters’
scale, making them smaller. This can aﬀect the characters ability to pick up items, get to certain locations,
or make themselves noticed.
Regular Die = 6: This room contains some or all of
the supplies for the construct, such as the food and
water of a dungeon’s guards. The players’ characters
could restock their own supplies or be creative and
turn this discovery to their advantage.

Wild Die = 5
Regular Die = 1: A device, person, or mental eﬀect
espouses divinations that prove to be true (although
they may be vague).
Regular Die = 2: A device, person, or mental eﬀect
espouses divinations that prove to be utterly false
(although they may be made true by the superstitious).
Regular Die = 3: This room contains a map or depiction of the construct that is entirely accurate (such as
the designer’s blueprints), although not all encounters
may be listed if they were changed after the map was
constructed.
Regular Die = 4: This room contains a map or
depiction of the construct that is somewhat accurate
but has been purposefully designed to be misleading

112
and inaccurate. (“The Dragon in this chamber likes to
be poked with sticks!”)
Regular Die = 5: This room contains what seems
to be the exact same encounter as an earlier room, but
something signiﬁcant has been changed about it. For
example, an earlier room might have featured combat
with a Harpy, while this room contains a Harpy that
is actually a princess cursed into the form of a Harpy.
Players’ characters who rush in may ﬁnd themselves
surprised or disappointed at their haste.
Regular Die = 6: The room is covered with an illusion such that the immediate situation isn’t obvious.
This could be as simple as an illusion of solid ﬂoor over
a pit trap, or as complicated as the players’ character
believing they have exited the dungeon and are returning to their village, when in fact they’re entrapped by
a hallucinogenic ooze.

Wild Die = 6
Regular Die = 1: This room contains information
that, if deciphered or ﬁgured out, will prove useful in a
future combat encounter (such as a creature’s weakness
or details about how many to expect). If the beneﬁts
of this are not obviously portable (such as a potion
or weapon), then this information should count as at
least a +5 bonus to the attack or defense rolls made
against the encounter.
Regular Die = 2: This room contains information
that, if deciphered or ﬁgured out, will turn out to be
useful in a future skill resolution encounter (such as
information as to how to overcome a trap or how one

• Chapter Three

can best clear a chasm). This should count as at least a
+5 bonus to the skill resolution situation.
Regular Die = 3: This room contains information
that, if deciphered or ﬁgured out, will provide a beneﬁt
in a future roleplaying encounter (such as information
as to what a creature wants or how a person needs to
be treated).
Regular Die = 4: Those players’ characters with
one of the Extranormal abilities may ﬁnd themselves
denied access to those abilities for some reason. For
example, maybe the laws of magic within a dungeon are
such that failing a Magic roll will deny him access for
the remainder of the time within, or perhaps a player’s
character’s Miracles are suppressed within a temple as
long as three relics to an opposing deity are present.
Regular Die = 5: An otherwise ordinary encounter
is made much more challenging because the “normal”
rules don’t apply. For example, the room might be devoid
of gravity, time might ﬂow diﬀerently, or perhaps the
only way to harm a creature is to try to heal it.
Regular Die = 6: Somehow, one or more of the
players’ characters are given access to an Extranormal
attributes, if they don’t already have them. For example,
they might meet a deity’s Celestial who oﬀers them
access to Miracles, or they might meet the familiar
of a deceased wizard who oﬀers to teach Magic. This
does not actually grant the attribute, but rather gives
the option of purchasing it after character creation;
if the oﬀer is accepted, all of that player’s character’s
forthcoming Character Points go toward paying for
that new attribute until 1D is purchased.
