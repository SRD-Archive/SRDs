• Introduction •
This book provides the fundamentals necessary to play in nearly
any fantasy setting — low, high, and pseudo-historical — using West
End Games’ famous D6 System roleplaying game rules.
If you’re reading this book, you probably already know what a roleplaying game is. In case you need a refresher or to explain it to your
friends, we suggest telling them that this is an interactive storytelling
game wherein they play the part of major characters in the story. If
they’re still interested, let them read this introduction.
You might also want to start with this introduction if you’ve roleplayed before getting this book but it wasn’t with the D6 System.

What Is a Roleplaying Game?
A roleplaying game is very much like improvisational acting or
interactive storytelling — but with rules. Many video games are like
this, and there are plenty of online interactive worlds, so chances are
good that you know what a roleplaying game is about. This roleplaying
game, however, doesn’t need any expensive equipment, special software or cartridges, or a connection to the Internet.

What Do I Need to Play?
To play this game, you need this book, some paper, something
to write with, some six-sided dice, a lot of imagination, and a group
of people, one of whom is willing to act as the guiding force in the
game. This person is called many things, but “gamemaster” serves
well as shorthand for someone who presents information about the
game setting, creates obstacles for the other players to overcome,
takes the part of the people the players encounter, and adjudicates
the rules. The rest of the group, simply called “the players,” take on
roles of major characters in the story that they and the gamemaster
create together.
The stories are called “adventures” or “scenarios.” Very short
adventures, usually encompassing only one or two obstacles to a
simple goal, are referred to as “encounters.” A series of encounters
can become an adventure, while a series of adventures can turn into
a campaign. This book contains a chapter (called “Adventure Tips”)
on how to come up with adventures.

Where Do I Go Next?

Will you be you joining a game where everyone else knows
how to play, and you don’t have a lot of time to learn the rules?
Read Chapter 1, “Character Basics,” and then ﬂip to the character templates on pages 128–137 of this book. Ask the gamemaster which one
or ones you can use. (These are also available for downloading from the
West End Games Web site.) Fill in the template as you learned from
Chapter 1, then take the sheet to the game session and start playing.
The rest of the players will teach the details as you go along.

Do you have some time to learn the rules, but you don’t
want to be the gamemaster? Read all of the chapters up through
the “Healing” chapter. In this introduction is a solitaire adventure
that will get you started on the basics; the rest of the chapters ﬁll
in more details. Then skip to the “Equipment” chapter. If you’ll also
play someone with magical or miraculous abilities, you’ll also need
to read those chapters.
Do you want to be the gamemaster, with all its responsibilities and privileges? You’ll need to read this entire book, or at
least through the “Healing” chapter and skim the rest. Then use the
“Adventure Tips” chapter to design your own scenario. After that,
invite some friends over, introduce them to creating characters,
and have fun!

System Overview
This overview provides basic concepts germane to roleplaying with
the D6 System. The concepts presented herein are further explained
in the rest of this book, and an introductory adventure will give you
a chance to try out what you’ve learned here.

Performing Actions
Each player has a character with attributes and skills that describe
how well he or she can perform various actions. Attributes represent
a character’s innate abilities, while skills are speciﬁc applications of
those abilities.

•

Introduction
Introduction
Most game mechanics in D6 Fantasy involve rolling some six-sided
dice. A die code associated with each attribute and skill represents
how good the character is in that area. A die code associated with a
weapon shows how much harm it can cause. The larger the number,
the more experienced, trained, or naturally adept your character is,
or the more deadly the weapon, or the more useful the equipment.
Each die code indicates the number of six-sided dice you roll
when you want your character to do something (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D,
etc.), and sometimes an amount (called pips) of “+1” or “+2,” which
is added to the total result you roll on the dice.
Example: If your character’s Physique attribute is 3D+1, when
you have her try to lift a ale barrel, you would roll three dice and add
1 to the total to get her result.
To represent the randomness of life (and the tons of little modiﬁers
that go along with it), every time you roll dice, make sure that one
of them is of a diﬀerent color than the others. This special die is the
Wild Die, and it can have some interesting eﬀects on your dice total.
(If you only have one die to roll, then that die is the Wild Die.)
If the Wild Die comes up as a 2, 3, 4, or 5, add the result to the
other dice normally. If the Wild Die comes up as a 6, this is a Critical
Success. Add the 6 to your other dice results and roll the Wild Die
again. As long as you roll a 6, you keep adding the 6 and you keep
rolling. If you roll anything else, you add that number to the total and
stop rolling. If the Wild Die comes up as a 1 on the ﬁrst roll, this is a
Critical Failure. Tell the gamemaster, who will let you know whether
or not to add it to your total.
The higher you roll, the better your character accomplishes the
task at hand. When your character tries doing something, the gamemaster decides on the required skill and a diﬃculty based on the
task’s complexity. The gamemaster doesn’t usually tell you the difﬁculty number you need to equal or beat to succeed. He often won’t
inform you which tasks are easier and which are harder, though he
might give you hints. (“Hmmm, jumping over a narrow ravine with
a raging river below is going to be pretty hard.…”) The gamemaster
then uses the rules to interpret the die roll and determine the results
of the action.

Getting Hurt
To describe how much injury a character can sustain, the gamemaster decides on one of two ways of determining how much damage
a character can take: Body Points or Wounds.
With the Body Points system, each character has a certain number
of Body Points (which are ﬁgured out when you create your character).
You subtract the amount of damage the attacker rolls for his weapon
from the total number of Body Points your character has.
With the Wounds system, each character has a certain number
of Wounds. You roll your character’s Physique while the attacker
rolls damage. Compare the diﬀerence between the damage and the
Physique roll the Wounds level chart; the chart lets you know how
many Wounds your character gets from the attack.
In either system, when your character has no more Body Points
or Wounds left, she’s toast.

Improving Rolls
In addition to scores for a character’s attributes and skills, she
has Fate Points and Character Points. You can spend these points in

Page 4

• Page 4

particularly diﬃcult and heroic situations.
When you spend a Character Point, you get to roll one extra Wild
Die when you character tries to complete a task. You may choose to
spend a Character Point after you’ve made a roll (in case you want
to improve your result).
When you spend a Fate Point, that means your character is using
all of her concentration to try to succeed. You may spend a Fate Point
only before any die rolls are made. Doing so doubles the number of
dice you’d normally roll, usually for one round and one action only,
though the gamemaster may allow players to spend more Fate Points
in particularly challenging moments. This allows the character to do
one action really well.
Once a Character Point or Fate Point is used, it’s gone. You gain
more Character Points at the end of a game for completing goals and
playing well. You may get back Fate Points at the end of the game if
they were used at a brave, heroic, or climactic moment.

Try It Out!
Now that you have the basics down, let’s try out a short scenario.
First, you’ll need a character. On the next page, you’ll ﬁnd a template.
Most of the game characteristic information is ﬁlled in. The attributes
and skills are listed in two columns on the left-hand side of the page.
The attributes names — Agility, Coordination, Physique, Charisma,
Intellect, Acumen, and Extranormal — are printed in bold above the
lighter skill names. There are more skills in the game than the ones
listed on this sheet, but these are the ones commonly associated with
the type of profession this template is supposed to represent.
In the center column, below the chain line, are some more characteristics. Fate Points and Character Points show the number of
these special roll-improving bonuses your character currently has.
Funds and silver are measures of how much wealth your character
can usually get at.
In the far right column, you’ll see Advantages, Disadvantages,
Special Abilities, and a description of your character. These give you
an idea about the kind of character that you’re playing. The equipment
paragraph lists the items your character can use during the game.
Below that, you’ll ﬁnd “Strength Damage.” This shows how much
harm your character can cause with brute force. Underneath this is
“Move.” This characteristic lists the number of meters your character
can easily walk in ﬁve seconds.
After those, you’ll see the Body Points, Wound levels, and the
related Body Point ranges for your character. Each of these represents
how much injury your character can take. This short adventure won’t
use Wounds or the Body Points range, so you can ignore them. Instead,
you only need to keep in mind the Body Points number.

Have a Character?
If you already have a D6 System character — from another
D6 System game or because you created a new one using
the rules in this book — you can still play this adventure.
Simply skip to the “A Typical Tavern” section and follow the
directions.

Introduction
Now that you can ﬁnd your way around a character template, let’s
ﬁll in the missing game characteristics. To keep it easy, pick seven
skills that you want your character to have experience or training
in. Look at the die code next to the attribute that the ﬁrst skill is
listed under, and add one to the number in front of the “D.” Write
this new die code next to the skill. Do this for each of the seven
skills you picked.
Example: If you decided to put 1D in climbing, your score for
climbing would be your Agility score plus one, or 4D+1.
Then ﬁll in the top of the sheet, if you’d like, with your character’s
name and other details.
In addition to your character sheet, you’ll need a pencil and some
six-sided dice, one of which should be a diﬀerent color or size than
the others. This special die is your Wild Die. As you go through this
scenario, don’t read the sections in order. Instead, start with number
1, make a selection, and read the section where your selection tells
you to go. Keep doing that until you get to section 15, which is the
end. Then you’ll be ready for your ﬁrst D6 Fantasy adventure!

A Typical Tavern

1

You’ve only been at this adventuring thing a few months, and so
far, it hasn’t been quite what you expected — no maidens in distress;
no villages tormented by beasts.
As you come into a hamlet, you dejectedly head for the tavern.
You step inside and pause a moment, waiting for your eyes to adjust.
Large windows with shutters open wide to let in some light.
You see a Human woman and an Elf man talking at one table
far from the door. Several paces closer, a Human man, somewhat
grizzled, seems to be getting himself well drunk at another table.
Upon spotting you come in, he staggers to his feet, knocking his
chair backwards with a clatter. “You can’t have my table!” the older
man yells as he wobbles toward you.
Before you decide what to do, let’s ﬁnd out who goes ﬁrst: go
to 12.

2
You rolled a Critical Failure on the Wild Die. Take away the one
and your highest number. Read the result on the remaining die, and
add any pips if your Acumen die code included them. (If you’re using
the Aspiring Hero sample character, then you add 1 to the number
on the die.)
• Go to 5.

3
You seemed to have convinced the man. His shoulders sag, and
he reaches down to pick up the fallen chair. This has the interesting
eﬀect of unbalancing him. He tumbles over the chair and doesn’t get
up, apparently having dropped into a drunken stupor.

• Page 6

maneuver seemed to oﬀ-balance him, though. He staggers back a
step and trips over the fallen chair, crashing to the ﬂoor and staying
there in a drunken stupor.
• Go to 13.

5
The drunk is quicker on his feet than he looks. Before you can react,
he rushes forward to punch you. His wild swing connects with your
stomach, causing you to stagger a step. Let’s ﬁnd out how much that’s
going to hurt. Your ability to resist damage, called your damage resistance total, equals the Armor Value of any protection you’re wearing (like
your leather jerkin) plus any other modiﬁers. Since there are no other
modiﬁers, your damage resistance total equals 2 (which is the Armor
Value of the jerkin). Your adversary did four points of damage with his
ﬁst. So, the total amount of injury you take equals the tough’s damage
total minus your damage resistance total, or two points. Subtract two
points from the total number of Body Points you have.
That’s not even enough to knock the wind out of you. Now it’s
your turn.
• If you want to persuade him to drop this ﬁght, go to 7.
• If you think he’ll only listen to force, go to 9.

6
You rolled a Critical Success on the Wild Die. Add the 6 to the total
of the other dice, and roll only the Wild Die again. As long as you
get a 6 on the Wild Die, keep adding that 6 to the total and roll the
die again. If you get any other number – even a 1 – simply add that
number to the total you already have. (If you’re using the Aspiring
Hero sample character, then you add a 1 to the ﬁnal total.)
• Go to 10.

7
“I’m not sure what your problem is,” you speak calmly to the weaving man, “but there’s no reason to take it out on me. I just walked
into town a few minutes ago. Why don’t I buy you an ale, sir, or take
you outside to get a little fresh air?”
Look at your character sheet and ﬁnd charm or persuasion. If you
put extra dice in either of these, look at the die code next to the
skill name. If you didn’t, then look at the die code of their governing attribute, Charisma. Take a number of dice equal to the number
in front of the “D” of whichever one you’re using; make sure one of
those dice is the Wild Die. Roll the dice. If the Wild Die is a 1, take
it away as well as the highest die and add the rest of them. If the
Wild Die is a 6, add the 6, reroll the Wild Die, and keep adding and
rerolling as long you get a 6 (otherwise, just add the number to the
rest of the total). If it’s anything else on the Wild Die, add together
the results of all of the dice.
• If the total on the dice is greater than or equal to 15, go to 3.
• If the total on the dice is less than 15, go to 14.

8

• Go to 13.

4
The old man must have somehow anticipated your move (or his
wobbling made you miscalculate your punch), because he steps out
of the way just as your ﬁst is about to connect with his face. Your

You give him a quick and sharp jab on the jaw. The older man’s
eyes go wide. He staggers back a step and trips over the fallen chair,
crashing to the ﬂoor and staying there in a drunken stupor.
• Go to 13.

Introduction

9
Some people can be reasoned with, and others need a tap on their
noggins to get their attention. Look at your character sheet and ﬁnd
ﬁghting. If you put extra dice in this skill, look at the die code next
to the skill name. If you didn’t, then look at the die code of the governing attribute, Agility. Take a number of dice equal to the number
in front of the “D” of whichever one you’re using; make sure one of
those dice is the Wild Die. Roll the dice. If the Wild Die is a 1, take
it away as well as the highest die and add the rest of them. If the
Wild Die is a 6, add the 6, reroll the Wild Die, and keep adding and
rerolling as long you get a 6 (otherwise, just add the number to the
rest of the total). If it’s anything else on the Wild Die, add together
the results of all of the dice.
• If the total on the dice is greater than or equal to 5, go to 8.
• If the total on the dice is less than 5, go 4.

10
You’re a little quicker at assessing the situation than the drunk
is. You get the chance to do something before he can react. What do
you want to do?
• If you want to persuade him to drop this ﬁght, go to 7.
• If you think he’ll only listen to force, go to 9.

11
Since you didn’t get a 1 or 6 on the Wild Die, simply total the
dice and add any pips if your Acumen die code included them. (If
you’re using the Aspiring Hero character, then you add a 1 to the
total on the dice.)
• If the Acumen total is greater than or equal to 6, go to 10.
• If the Acumen total is less than 6, go to 5.

12
First, let’s ﬁnd out who’s got the faster reactions in this combat
encounter. Look at your character sheet and ﬁnd “Acumen” and the
die code next to it. Take a number of dice equal to the number in
front of the “D”; make sure one of those dice is the Wild Die (and
diﬀerently colored from the rest). So, if the die code is 3D+1, you
would have two regular dice and one Wild Die. Roll the dice and then
select the option that matches the results on the Wild Die.
• If you rolled a 1 on the Wild Die, go to 2.
• If you rolled a 6 on the Wild Die, go to 6.
• If you rolled any number other than a 1 or a 6, go to 11.

13
The woman, other man, and bartender have watched this exchange,
seemingly nonplussed by it all. The bartender shakes his head as he
goes back to wiping out mugs. The woman motions you over to her
and her companion. “Come here. Let us buy you a drink. We don’t
get many visitors here, and despite Stepka’s proclamation, we don’t
mind them. Tell us about yourself. What brings you to our town?”
You seat yourself at the table, gratefully accepting the drink and
deciding how best to start your tale.
• Go to 15.

• Page 7

14

The drunk sneers at your ridiculous statement, and he rushes
forward to punch you. His wild swing connects with your stomach,
causing you to stagger a step. Let’s ﬁnd out how much that’s going
to hurt. Your ability to resist damage, called your damage resistance
total, equals the Armor Value of any protection you’re wearing (like
your leather jerkin) plus any other modiﬁers. Since there are no other
modiﬁers, your damage resistance total equals 2 (which is the Armor
Value of the jerkin). The drunk did four points of damage with his
ﬁst. So, the total amount of injury you take equals your adversary’s
damage total minus your damage resistance total, or two points.
Subtract two points from the total number of Body Points you have.
That’s not even enough to knock the wind out of you.
As you’re recovering, the older man spits at you, an action that
ultimately unbalances him. Unable to stop his fall, he crashes to ﬂoor
and remains there, snoring loudly in a drunken stupor.
• Go to 13.

15
In a full-length adventure, you’d have a lot more choices, but hopefully this short adventure gave you an idea of how the game works.
If you’re unsure, go back through the scenario, picking diﬀerent
answers and, probably, making diﬀerent die rolls. When you think
you’re ready, you can use the Aspiring Hero character to play in other
adventures with your friends, or you can go to Chapter 1 and learn
how to make your own character. Happy adventuring!

• Key Terms •
These deﬁnitions provide you with a general idea of what each
term means; they are described in more detail within the book.
Terms italicized within each deﬁnition refer to another entry within
this glossary.
action: A task that the character undertakes or something that
the character does, like give a speech or climb a wall.
active defense value: A number the character gets when concentrating on getting out of the way of an attack.
Armor Value: A die code representing the amount of protection
a defensive covering provides. It can help determine the damage
resistance total. This term is sometimes abbreviated AV.
Body Points: One of two ways of indicating the amount of
injury a character can sustain, listed as a number. The damage total
is subtracted from the character’s current Body Point total. May be
used alone or with Wounds.
Character Point: A bonus representing a surge of adrenaline or
that extra luck the main characters of a story seem to have. Allows
the user to roll an additional Wild Die.
combat diﬃculty: A number representing how challenging it is
to attack someone or something. It equals the active defense value or
the passive defense value.
complementary skill: A skill whose results could aid in the use
of another skill.
creation points: Points used when designing a character to purchase die codes in game characteristics or other features that represent
the character’s abilities, experience, and background.
Critical Failure: A result, represented by a 1, on the Wild Die
that indicates something bad has occurred.
Critical Success: A result, represented by a 6, on the Wild Die
that indicates something good has happened. Generally, the player
adds the 6 to the current total and rolls again, adding and rerolling
as long as a 6 comes up.
D (as in “1D”): An abbreviation for “six-sided dice.” The number in
front of the “D” is part of the die code, and lets you know how many
six-sided dice to roll.
damage resistance total: A number that indicates how much
injury a character or object can absorb, soak, or deﬂect.
damage total: A number representing how much injury or
destruction something has caused.
defaulting to an attribute: Using the die code for an attribute
when the character doesn’t have a higher die code in the needed
skill.
die code, score: The number of six-sided dice players roll (1D, 2D,
3D, 4D, 5D, etc.), and sometimes an amount (called pips) of “+1” or
“+2” that is added to the total result that came up on the dice. “Die
code” and “score” are used interchangeably.
diﬃculty: A number representing how challenging it is to perform an action.

Fate Point: A bonus representing that a character is using all of
her concentration to try to succeed. Allows the player to, at least,
double the number of dice on one roll. Sometimes the gamemaster
will provide other beneﬁts.
free action: Any action that needs only a few seconds or less to
perform or do, such as taking a few steps or glancing quickly around
a room.
modiﬁer: A number or die code that is added or subtracted from
another number or die code to represent a change in the typical
situation.
multi-action penalty: A modiﬁer to a skill or attribute die code
that represents the increased challenge of doing more than one
action at a time.
opposed diﬃculty, opposed roll: A diﬃculty that applies when
one character resists another character’s action. In this case, both
characters roll die codes related to the activity and compare them.
passive defense value: A number representing a character’s
innate ability to get out of the way of danger. It usually equals 10.
pip: An added bonus to the total result that came up on the
dice. A “+1” means one is added to the total, while “+2” means two
is added.
range (in combat): The distance from the attacker to the target.
result points: The diﬀerence between the total rolled with an
attribute’s or skill’s die code and the diﬃculty of an action.
result points bonus: Usually, one-half (rounded up) of the
result points ﬁgured for an action. It sometimes may be used to
aﬀect other rolls.
round: A unit of time equal to ﬁve seconds in the game world.
Figuring out what happens in a round can take longer.
scale: A game mechanic representing that opponents of vastly
diﬀerent sizes can aﬀect each other diﬀerently in combat.
standard diﬃculty: A number, generally selected from a chart,
assigned to an action based on how challenging it is.
Strength Damage: A die code representing the amount of harm
a character can do because of his or her physical prowess.
Toughness: A die code representing the amount of damage an
object can take, similar to a character’s Physique attribute.
unskilled modiﬁer, untrained modiﬁer: A modiﬁer added to
an action’s diﬃculty that represents the increased diﬃculty of doing
something without the right training or experience. The terms are
used interchangeably.
Wild Die: A six-sided die, of a diﬀerent color or size from other
dice used, that represents the randomness of life, with the 1 and the 6
indicating a special result (see Critical Failure and Critical Success).
Wounds: One of two ways of indicating the amount of injury
a character can sustain, listed as a level. The level is determined by
comparing the diﬀerence between the damage total and the damage
resistance total to a chart. May be used alone or with Body Points.

CHAPTER I

• Character Basics •
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter covers three methods of character creation and provides an overview of the attributes and skills available to characters.
If you’ve made a character already, skip past “Character Creation”
to “Attributes” and skim the rest of the chapter, adjusting your
character if necessary.

Character Creation
To make a character, you’ll need to select a template from within
this book or another D6 System game, or make your own. A blank
character sheet also is included at the end of this book. You can either
photocopy your chosen sheet, or copy the information onto a separate
piece of paper. You also can ﬁnd the templates available free at the
West End Games Web site, www.westendgames.com.

Templates
A few starting templates have been provided at the end of this
book. To get started right away, pick one and distribute seven skill
dice among the skills listed; the dice for attributes have already
been done for you. Although the listed skills are the ones that type
of character might typically have, though you could include others
not on the list if you’d like.
For skill descriptions and details on how to distribute skill dice,
see the “Skills” section later in this chapter.
If desired, you can ﬁll in the other character features (such as
gender, age, etc.) and provide any additional notes on the character’s
history. There is no need to purchase equipment, as that has already
been ﬁgured for the characters.
If you choose a template from another D6 System game, you may
need to make some adjustments in the types of skills a character
based on that might have. Check the list herein to make sure the
template’s skills are described in this D6 version. If one is not, either
cross it oﬀ the template or substitute a similar skill that does exist.
Also, some attributes may have diﬀerent names. If you are unsure
how an attribute translates to D6 Fantasy, ask your gamemaster.
Once you have ﬁnished ﬁlling in your template, you can either
start playing the game with your group, or you can skip to the “Game
Basics” chapter and read more on how to use your new character.

Defined Limits
If you wish to make your own starting character from scratch,
without a template but with deﬁned limits on what can be put into
attributes and skills, use these guidelines. This chapter describes
each characteristic in more detail, including examples on how you
can split the dice.

These guidelines assume you’ll make a normal Human character.
If not, talk with your gamemaster about the minimums, maximums,
and other requirements for the character race you want to use. Peruse
the “Non-Human Races” chapter for some sample ideas.
See the various sections in this chapter for details on dice distribution and ﬁguring out other aspects of your character.
Attributes: Distribute 18 dice among the seven attributes. The
minimum is 1D and the maximum is 5D in all attributes except Extranormal attributes, which remains at 0D for most characters.
Skills: Distribute seven dice among the skills. The maximum
number of dice added to any one skill is 3D.
Move: This equals 10 meters per round.
Body Points: If your gamemaster is using this characteristic,
roll your character’s Physique and add 20 to the total. Ignore this
characteristic if your gamemaster is only using Wounds.
Wounds: If your gamemaster is using the Wound levels option
with Body Points, see the appropriate table in the “Damage and Body
Points” section of the “Damage” chapter to determine the range of
Body Points associated with each Wound level. If your gamemaster
only will use Wounds, you don’t need to ﬁgure out the Body Points
range; you can put a line through that column if you’d like.
Strength Damage: Drop the pips from your character’s Physique
or lifting score (including any Special Abilities or Disadvantages that
aﬀect the die code), divide the number by 2, and round up. This is
the Strength Damage die code.
Funds and Silver: Funds and Silver reveal how much wealth
your character can usually get at without too much trouble. All
characters start with a base Funds die code of 3D. Check “Funds” in

Chapter 1
this chapter for modiﬁers to this roll and how to convert
this number to coins. The cash equivalent of Funds goes
on the Silver line.
Character Points: Characters start with ﬁve Character Points.
Fate Points: Characters start with one Fate Point.
For equipment, Advantages, Disadvantages, Special
Abilities, background, and character features, see the
appropriate sections in this chapter for more details on
how to ﬁll out these optional sections.

Creation Point Pool
Those who wish to use points to create their characters,
rather than following a template or being restricted in
what they can put in skills and attributes, can use a point
system. Each novice character receives 79 creation points
to distribute among all the options. Players may only spend
creation points as whole points, not as fractions.
• One attribute die equals four creation points.
• One skill die equals one creation point.
• Three skill specialization dice equal one creation
point.
• Advantages and Special Abilities have their own
costs associated with them; see the “Character Options”
chapter for details.

• Page 10

Experienced Characters
If you are making an experienced character, you’ll need to ﬁgure out how
many more years that character has been around than one starting out.

By Templates or Defined Limits
Using the initial novice totals of seven skill dice, ﬁve Character Points,
and one Fate Point, add 15 skill dice, 15 Character Points, and two Fate
Points to the initial totals for each year the character has been a full-time
active adventurer. (For part-timers, halve these ﬁgures, rounding up.)

By Creation Point Pool
With the initial novice totals of 79 creation points, ﬁve Character
Points, and one Fate Point as a starting point, add 15 creation points, 15
Character Points, and two Fate Points for each year the character has been a
full-time active adventurer. (For part-timers, halve these ﬁgures, rounding
up.) Unless the gamemaster decides otherwise, there are no maximums for
skills and Disadvantages.

Existing Personae
A player basing her character on an existing ﬁctional entity should ignore
the skill and Disadvantage limits and, with their gamemaster’s approval,
create the character by distributing dice as best reﬂects how the character
appears in his, her, or its stories.

Other restrictions apply:
• Attributes have a minimum of 1D and a maximum of
5D, except in Extranormal attributes.
• The maximum starting number of dice that may be added to any
one skill or specialization of skill is 3D.
• Points must be spent on whole dice, though the purchased dice
may be split and distributed in their category. For instance, if a player
spends four creation points to get one attribute die, the die may be
split into three pips and divided among up to three attributes, but
no attribute pip may be traded in for a skill die.
Players of Human characters may add up to 10 additional creation
points to their totals by taking an appropriate number of ranks in
Disadvantages. Non-Human species may have their own creation
point totals, maximum number of points from Disadvantages, and
starting Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities.
For worlds involving more Special Abilities, gamemasters should
feel free to raise the number of starting creation points and the number
of possible creation points received from Disadvantages.
Characters also receive the following aspects, like those created
with deﬁned limits:
Move: This equals 10 meters per round.
Body Points: If your gamemaster includes this characteristic,
roll your character’s Physique and add 20 to the total. Ignore this
characteristic if your gamemaster is using Wounds only.
Wounds: If your gamemaster relies on the Wound levels option
with Body Points, see the appropriate table in the “Damage and Body
Points” section of the “Damage” chapter to determine the range of
Body Points associated with each Wound level. If your gamemaster
uses Wounds only, you don’t need to ﬁgure out the Body Points range;
you can put a line through that column if you’d like.

Strength Damage: Drop the pips from your character’s Physique
or lifting score (including any Special Abilities or Disadvantages that
aﬀect the die code), divide the number by 2, and round up. This is
the Strength Damage die code.
Funds and Silver: Funds and silver measure how much wealth your
character can usually get at without too much trouble. All characters
start with a base Funds die code of 3D. Look under “Funds” in this
chapter for modiﬁers to this roll and how to convert this number to
cash. The cash equivalent of Funds goes on the Silver line.

Attributes
Each character has seven attributes, which measure basic physical
and mental abilities that are common to every living creature (and
some nonliving things), no matter what universe or dimension they
exist in.
Agility: An indication of balance, limberness, quickness, and fullbody motor abilities.
Coordination: A quantiﬁcation of hand-eye coordination and ﬁne
motor abilities.
Physique: An estimation of physical power and ability to resist
damage.
Intellect: A measure of strength of memory and ability to learn.
Acumen: Your character’s mental quickness, creativity, and attention to detail.
Charisma: A gauge of emotional strength, physical attractiveness,
and personality.
Extranormal: An assessment of your character’s extraordinary
abilities, which could include magic, miracles, or other extranormal

Character Basics
talents. It is often listed by its type, rather than by the term “Extranormal.” Most characters begin with a score of 0D, since people with
such abilities are extremely rare. Those who have an Extranormal
attribute must decide how it’s manifested. Characters almost never
have more than one Extranormal attribute. Magic and Miracles are
two Extranormal attributes described in this book.
When you put dice in an attribute, you can either put whole dice
in each attribute, or you can give each a mixture of whole dice and
pips. Each die equals three pips.
Example: You’ve distributed most of your attribute dice, but you
have four dice left to put in Intellect and Charisma. You could put
1D in Intellect and 3D in Charisma, or 2D+1 in Intellect and 1D+2 in
Charisma, or some similar combination.
Extranormal is the only attribute in which a Human character
may have no dice; there is no maximum that a Human character
may have in this attribute. No Human character may have less than
1D or more than 5D in any other attribute. Other races may have
other minimums and maximums, which may be represented by the
Increased Attribute Special Ability or the Hindrance Disadvantage,
which are either listed with the race description or speciﬁed by the
gamemaster. See the “Character Options” chapter for details on
Disadvantages and Special Abilities, and the “Non-Human Races”
chapter for some other fantasy race examples.

Skills
Skills are more speciﬁc applications of an attribute. For example,
the skill dodge is a more speciﬁc use of your character’s Agility. Characters learn them through instruction or experience.
Skills are areas of expertise that are not necessarily common to
every living creature. Some creatures simply don’t have the capacity
to learn certain skills.
All skills beneath a given attribute begin at that attribute’s die
code. To highlight skills in which the character has trained or has
some experience, add pips or dice to the base attribute value.
As with attributes, when creating your character you can either
put whole dice in each skill, or you can give each a mixture of whole
dice and pips. Remember that each die equals three pips.
Example: You’ve chosen your attribute scores, including putting
2D+1 in Intellect. If you wanted her to be a little better in the speaking

Focused Skills
Some gamemasters prefer narrower skill categories,
requiring characters to select more speciﬁc abilities, such as
animal handling: horses or reading/writing: Gnomish. If that’s
the case, players’ characters start with 21 skill dice or 93
creation points. Players need to get gamemaster approval
on any subcategories they choose, while gamemasters need
to insure that the subcategories are neither too broad (all
mammals) or too narrow (a single type of poison). Players
may take specializations of these narrower skills, as described
in the rules. Characters under this rule may never take the
general skill without selecting a subcategory.

• Page 11

skill, you could add one pip to the base attribute to get a speaking skill
score of 2D+2. If you decided to add two pips to the base attribute,
the speaking score becomes 3D.
You can also specialize in skills. Specializations reﬂect a greater
familiarity in a particular area covered by a base skill. One skill die
equals three specialization dice. Of course, one specialization die
still equals three pips.
You don’t need to have any extra dice in the base skill in order to
take a specialization in that skill, but when you give your character
specializations in that manner, they are treated as separate skills. If
you give your character specializations in base skills he already has,
those specializations are considered bonuses to the base skill when
attempting tasks of that type.
Once you’ve chosen at least one specialization and put one or two
pips or dice in it, you have to use the remaining specialization dice
and pips to either purchase more pips in the same specialization or
purchase one or more pips in other specializations.
You roll the specialization’s die code only when you use the speciﬁc
item or knowledge reﬂected by the specialization. Otherwise, you
roll the base skill (or attribute if you didn’t put additional dice in the
full skill).
Example: If your character’s Intellect is 2D+2 and her speaking is
3D, you could give her a speaking specialization of Elvish of +1 (which
means that, when she’s trying to speak with Elves, you roll three dice
and adds 1 to the total). You would then have two specialization dice
and two specialization pips to place among other specializations. With
these, you could further improve her speaking: Elvish specialization,
or you could pick one or more other specializations in the same or
other base skills.
You decide that with one other specialization pip, you’ll give your
character cultures: Elves, but you won’t take the full cultures skill for
her. This allows your character to have cultures: Elves at 3D (add 1
to the die code of the base attribute, Intellect, which is 2D+2). Thus,
when your character attempts to determine how best to handle
Elvish relations, you roll 3D, but if she tries to ﬁgure out what’s an
appropriate gift for a Dwarf, you only rely on the attribute’s score,
which is 2D+2.
A character may not put dice in any skill associated with the
Extranormal attribute unless that character already has dice in that
attribute.
The maximum number of dice the character may start with in any
base skill is 3D greater than the governing attribute, with no more
than 3D greater than the base skill in any specialization.
You can ﬁnd the list of skills and their descriptions on pages
12–13.

Advantages, Disadvantages,
& Special Abilities
Advantages and Disadvantages are beneﬁts or problems your
character has. Some aﬀect the character’s attributes and skills, while
others serve as useful roleplaying tools for rounding out the character. Special Abilities are unusual talents or powers the character has
that most other Humans don’t have. The next chapter, “Character
Options,” discusses these characteristics. You may ignore this section
if you don’t want to add them to your character.

Chapter 1

• Page 12

Skills
As this skill list includes broad deﬁnitions not applicable in all eras or worlds for which D6 Fantasy could be used, the gamemaster
has the ﬁnal say on actual skill applications. For diﬃculties associated with each skill, see the “Example Skill Diﬃculties” chapter.

Agility
acrobatics: Performing feats of gymnastics, extraordinary
balance, and dance (and related performance arts), as well as
breaking falls. Useful for running obstacle courses or doing courtly
promenade.
ﬁghting: Competence in unarmed combat.
climbing: Scaling various surfaces.
contortion: Escaping from otherwise secure physical bonds
by twisting, writhing, and contorting the body.
dodge: Slipping out of danger’s way, whether avoiding an
attack or a sprung booby trap.
ﬂying: Maneuvering under one’s own power (such as with
wings).
jumping: Leaping over obstacles.
melee combat: Wielding hand-to-hand weapons.
riding: Controlling and riding domesticated mounts.
stealth: Moving silently and avoiding detection, whether
through shadows or crowds.

Coordination
charioteering: Accelerating, steering, and decelerating chariots
(in particular) or any kind of cart-and-animal vehicle.
lockpicking: Opening a mechanical lock without possessing
the key or combination.
marksmanship: Shooting any kind of mechanical device
— such as a bow or sling — that projects missiles across a distance.
pilotry: Operating any water-faring vehicle, including steering, applying the oars, or managing the sails.
sleight of hand: Nimbleness with the ﬁngers and misdirection,
including picking pockets, palming items, and stage magic.
throwing: Hitting a target accurately with a thrown item,
including stones, javelins, bottles, and knives. Also used for
catching thrown items.

Physique
lifting: Moving or lifting heavy objects, as well as representing the ability to inﬂict additional damage with strength-powered
weapons.
running: Moving quickly on the ground while avoiding
obstacles and keeping from stumbling.
stamina: Physical endurance and resistance to pain, disease,
and poison.
swimming: Moving and surviving in a liquid medium.

Intellect
cultures: Comprehension of customs, traditions, art, history,
politics, and views on outsiders of various regions or groups, as
well as the ability to generalize about common cultural forms.

devices: Using and designing complex mechanical equipment.
Actually building items requires crafting.
healing: Dressing wounds, applying splints, and disinfecting
injuries, plus an understanding and application of medical procedures, such as diagnosing illnesses and performing surgery.
navigation: Determining the correct course using external
reference points, such as stars, maps, or landmarks, as well as
creating maps.
reading/writing: Familiarity with and ability to understand
various forms of written communication, as well as the ability to
create literary compositions, including forging papers and identifying such forgeries. Characters do not begin with the ability
to read or write.
scholar: This skill represents knowledge and/or education in
areas not covered under any other skill (such as alchemy, cooking, arcane lore, etc.). This may be restricted to a speciﬁc ﬁeld
(represented by specializations) or a general knowledge of a wide
range of subjects. It is used to remember details, rumors, tales,
legends, theories, important people, and the like, as appropriate
for the subject in question. However, the broader the category, the
fewer the details that can be recalled. It covers what the character
himself can recall. Having another skill as a specialization of the
scholar skill means that the character knows the theories and history behind the skill but can’t actually use it. Scholar can be useful
with investigation to narrow a search for information.
speaking: Familiarity with and ability to understand various forms of verbal communication. Characters know the Trade
Speech (assuming the setting has one) and one “native” language
in which they have spoken ﬂuency. Additional languages in which
a character has proﬁciency can be represented by specializations
of this skill.
trading: Knowledge of business practices, exchange rates, the
monetary value of goods and opportunities, and other information regarding barter and sales, including the ability to determine
how to make money with another skill the character has. Trading
can complement bluﬀ, charm, and persuasion when haggling over
prices for goods and services being bought or sold.
traps: Installing, altering, and bypassing security devices,
as well as identifying various kinds of traps (gas, pit, wire-triggered, etc.).

Acumen
artist: Making works of art, like paintings, music compositions, and dance choreographies.
crafting: Creating, ﬁxing, or modifying equipment, weapons,
armor, and vehicles, as well as woodworking, metalworking, constructing buildings, and the like.
(continued on next page)

Character Basics

• Page 13

Skills Continued
disguise: Altering features or clothing to be unrecognizable or
to look like someone else. Also useful in acting performances.
gambling: Playing and cheating at games of strategy and
luck.
hide: Concealing objects, both on oneself and using camouﬂage.
investigation: Gathering information, researching topics,
analyzing data, and piecing together clues.
know-how: Figuring out how to perform an action in which
the character does not have experience, as well as a catch-all skill
encompassing areas not covered by other skills (such as utilitarian
sewing or cooking).
search: Spotting hidden objects or people, reconnoitering,
lipreading, or eavesdropping on or watching another person.
streetwise: Finding information, goods, and contacts in an
urban environment, particularly through thieves’ guilds and
similar criminal organizations, black markets, and other illicit
operations. Also useful for determining possible motives and
methods of criminals.
survival: Surviving in wilderness environments, including
the ability to identify plants, animals, and their nutritional and
medicinal uses.
tracking: Following the trail of another person, animal, or creature, or keeping after a moving target without being noticed.

Charisma
animal handling: Controlling animals and making them
perform tricks and follow commands.
bluﬀ: Lying, tricking, or deceiving others, as well as verbal
evasion, misdirection, and blustering. Disguise can complement
uses of this skill. Also useful in putting on acting performances.
charm: Using friendliness, ﬂattery, or seduction to inﬂuence
someone else. Also useful in sales and bartering transactions,

Move
This number (usually 10) represents how many meters your
character moves in a round at maximum walking speed in standard
conditions. (The running skill can increase this rate.) Move also serves
as the base for other movement skills.
Should the character have a diﬀerent sort of movement than
normal (such as ﬁns for legs), see the Hindrance Disadvantage
(described in the “Character Options” chapter) for information on
how to account for this variability.

Special Points
Players’ characters typically start the game with one Fate Point
and ﬁve Character Points. You can spend these points to improve
your character’s chance of succeeding in especially diﬃcult situations.
(The mechanics of this are discussed in the “Game Basics” chapter.)
Character Points alternatively are used to permanently improve
skills. Your character earns more Character and Fate Points by hav-

putting on performances (such as singing, acting, or storytelling),
and situations involving etiquette.
command: Eﬀectively ordering and coordinating others in
team situations.
intimidation: Using physical presence, verbal threats, taunts,
torture, or fear to inﬂuence others or get information out of
them.
mettle: Ability to withstand stress, temptation, other people’s
interaction attempts, mental attacks, and pain. The gamemaster
may allow a specialization in a speciﬁc faith tradition or belief
system to enhance many, though not all, applications of mettle.
persuasion: Inﬂuencing others or getting information out
of them through bribery, honest discussion, debate, diplomacy,
or speeches. Also useful in negotiations, business transactions,
storytelling, and oration.

Extranormal: Magic
Magic is one possible Extranormal attribute. For speciﬁc information on Magic, see its chapter in this book.
alteration: Casting spells involving change.
apportation: Casting spells involving movement.
divination: Casting spells involving knowledge.
conjuration: Casting spells involving creation.

Extranormal: Miracles
Miracles is another possible Extranormal attribute. For speciﬁc
information on Miracles, see its chapter in this book.
divination: Requesting divine aid to gain knowledge of the
past, present, or future.
favor: Requesting divine aid to help, improve, heal, or beneﬁt
someone or something.
strife: Requesting divine aid to cause injury or destruction.

ing adventures. There is no limit to the number of Character or Fate
Points your character may have at any time.

Body Points & Wounds
This section of the character sheet allows you to keep track of
the healthiness of your character. Which you use depends on the
gamemaster.

Determining Body Points
When you create a new character, roll his Physique (including any
modiﬁers from Disadvantages or Special Abilities) and add 20. This
becomes his Body Point total. Write it on the character sheet in the space
provided. Templates already have their Body Points determined.
Example: Your character has 3D+1 in Physique. You roll three
dice, making sure one of them is the Wild Die. The dice come up 4
and 6, with a 1 on the Wild Die. Since the 1 has no negative eﬀect,
you add the numbers to arrive at a total of 11. You then include the

Chapter 1

Gamemaster’s Characters
Gamemaster’s characters (sometimes referred to as nonplayer characters or NPCs) may or may not be created using
the same rules as players’ characters. Because the gamemaster’s
characters serve as interactive elements in the story, it all
depends on the NPC’s importance to the story line. Minor
gamemaster’s characters have fewer attribute and skill dice,
fewer Body Points or Wounds, and few (if any) character
options, Character Points, or Fate Points. Major characters,
however, should follow the same guidelines as the players’
characters, possibly having more skill dice, Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities than a typical starting player’s
character. An increase over the players’ characters reﬂects the
fact that a major antagonist has been around much longer.

pip bonus of 1 with this for 12. Finally, you add 12 to 20 to get a Body
Point total of 32.

Determining Wounds
If your gamemaster is using the Wound levels option with Body
Points, see the appropriate table in the “Damage” chapter to determine
the range of Body Points associated with each Wound level. If your
gamemaster is only using Wounds, you don’t need to ﬁgure out the Body
Points range; you can put a line through that column if you’d like.

Strength Damage
Strength Damage indicates the amount of harm a character can
do in combat with body parts, melee weapons, thrown weapons, and
most missile weapons.

• Page 14

All characters start with a base of 3 in Funds. Use the accompanying table to adjust this number. Include any modiﬁers to attributes
due to Disadvantages or Special Abilities. The minimum total is 1.
The ﬁnal total becomes the die code in the Funds attribute.
After character creation, a player can increase the Funds attribute
by spending Character Points (using the rules in the “Improving Characters” chapter) or through bonuses received as adventure rewards.
If the gamemaster prefers to use cash or its equivalent, multiply
the Funds total by a value speciﬁed by the gamemaster (typically about
60 silver, but gamemasters may increase or decrease this depending
on how expensive goods and services are in their setting). This is how
much money the character receives per week for whatever sort of
work the character does or investments the character has.
Example: Your character has 4D in Intellect, 6D in trading, and
+2D in a specialization of trading: currency exchange. Starting with 3,
you add to it 1 for your high Intellect score and 1 for having at least 8D
in trading plus a specialization. Your ﬁnal total is 5, which gives you
a Funds score of 5D. If your gamemaster preferred cash, you would
start with a regular income of 300 silver per week.
Using the Funds attribute is discussed in the “Equipment”
chapter.

Equipment
A player of a starting character may select one small weapon
and a little protective gear plus a few tools of the character’s chosen
trade, unless there is equipment already listed on the template sheet.
Some basic equipment is explained in the “Equipment” chapter; the
gamemaster may allow other options.

Character Features &
Other Details

To determine the Strength Damage die code, take the character’s
Physique or lifting (including any die code modiﬁers from Disadvantages or Special Abilities) and drop the pips. Divide by 2, and
round up.

The character sheet provided in this book and most other templates include spots for your character’s name, career, species, gender,
age, and background information. Unless speciﬁed by the template
or your gamemaster allows otherwise, your character’s species is
Human. See the “Non-Human Races” chapter for details on alternate
racial packages. Everything else in these sections you are free to ﬁll
in as you like.

Example: A character with 3D in Physique has a Strength Damage of
2D. A character with 6D+2 in lifting has a Strength Damage of 3D.

Height & Weight

Determining Strength Damage

Templates & Strength Damage
If you added dice to a template’s lifting skill, you’ll
need to adjust the Strength Damage value listed. Use
the information above to correct the number.

Funds
To allow the gamemaster to more easily adjust the
“real world” cost to something appropriate for her
world or her part of the world, this system substitutes
diﬃculties for the prices of items. Each character thus
gets a Funds attribute, which represents the amount of
money the character can get without too much trouble
on a regular basis because of work or investments.

Players who want their characters signiﬁcantly larger or smaller
than the average Human have a few options. If the size is proportionately larger or smaller,
then the character must
have the Size Advantage.
If the size is a hindrance,

CHAPTER II

• Character Options •
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter is for players who want to explore more of their
characters’ possible backgrounds and traits. After completing basic
character generation in Chapter 1, look through this chapter to “ﬂesh
out” your character with interesting game- and story-related options
called Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities. These suggest the fact that your character might have knowledge, resources,
or abilities that aren’t reﬂected by the character’s attributes and
skills. If something inspires you to change your character’s basic
characteristics, feel free to go back and make adjustments.

Expanding the
Character Concept
When you ﬁrst created your character, you probably had a character
concept in mind or one was suggested by the template that you used.
Now’s the time to expand the character’s history.
There are several ways you can do this. The easiest is to answer
questions like:
• Where and when was my character born?
• What did my character do as a child?
• What unusual experiences did my character have?
• How did my character become the person he is now?
• What is one of my character’s major goals?
• What was my character doing right before the game begins?
• Why does my character have the skills that he has?
Say your character knows marksmanship and several specializations. Why? Was the character in the army? A child of a mercenary?
How were these skills learned? You don’t have to explain every skill,
but try to rationalize any unusual skills (such as Extranormal skills),
as well as skills the character has two dice or more in (he is really
good at those).
There are, of course, other questions you can come up with, though
these are among the most common.
You can jot down notes and go back and ﬁll in the gaps as you
play. You can make up the name of the character’s village, the exact
date of birth, and other things as you go along. If you’re stuck for
ideas, read the basic description of the game setting or remember
pertinent books, television shows, and movies — you can develop
ideas based on them.

Peruse the Character Options
You might not want to write a background for your character until
you look at some of the options available to you. Take a look at the
Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities, and see some of

the beneﬁts and drawbacks you can choose for your character. You
might see something you want to work in, and that will help give
you ideas for a background story.

Fantastic Species
Gamemasters and players can use character options to tweak
the basic Human starting character package into any sort of species
template that they desire. The next chapter, “Non-Human Races,”
provides some sample non-Human write-ups and character packages based on them.

Selecting Character Options
Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities make the character more interesting, more (and less) eﬀective, and more fun to
roleplay (if you do it right). You know the story of your character
— here’s what that story means in game terms.
Advantages are perks that the character has because of her status
in society, the people she knows, or something in her background.
They generally do not directly aﬀect attributes or skills.
Disadvantages hamper the character in some way. They might
aﬀect her attributes or skills or they might mean trouble for her in
certain situations. Both Advantages and Disadvantages make the
character more rounded and more believable.
Special Abilities are those abilities that exceed the usual or
natural capabilities of a Human character. The character’s species,
some sort of unique training, or a magical/miraculous/other eﬀect
might explain their origin. They give the character a bonus to her
attributes or skills, or they provide her with access to something that
the average Human character can’t do.
Example: You decide to give your character a Special Ability that
provides him with a +1 to one of three combat-related skill totals. If
you don’t have any points to spend on Special Abilities, your character

Game Mechanics
Within the descriptions of several Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities, you’ll notice references to game
mechanics that haven’t been explained yet (like the Critical
Failure die result and the names of diﬃculty levels). If this
is your ﬁrst time playing a D6 System game, you can ignore
these for now. You’ll learn more about them in the “Game
Basics” chapter. Once you start playing adventures, you’ll
ﬁnd the game mechanics in this chapter useful.

Chapter 2
needs to have some kind of Disadvantage as well. The character might
have to add 1 to the diﬃculty of all interaction-related skill totals, or
you might include a totally unrelated Disadvantage (of comparative
power) — like the character is afraid of the dark and has trouble
acting when in the dark.

Using Character Options
Every character option in this chapter has its own rules for implementation. There are, if you look hard enough, some nightmarish
combinations. If something seems like it is could cause trouble in
the game later on, check with your gamemaster before choosing it.
Ultimately, the gamemaster has ﬁnal say on the choice of all Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities, as well as ﬁnal say on the
interpretation of those choices. Players who misuse their character
options, particularly their Disadvantages, may ﬁnd their Advantages
or Special Abilities meeting with some unfortunate accident.

Organization
Advantages, Disadvantages, and Special Abilities are listed
alphabetically in their respective sections. Advantages and Disadvantages are further organized into ranks. These ranks are numbered;
higher-numbered ranks are more powerful. They are abbreviated
R1, R2, R3, R4, and so on. Special Abilities don’t have listed ranks.
Instead, the descriptions give the initial cost for gaining one rank
in that ability.
Note: Gamemasters may allow higher ranks of character options
than the examples given here. Players and gamemasters should discuss
the best way to represent their characters’ unique set of traits.

Costs at Character Creation
Each rank in an Advantage or Disadvantage is worth one creation
point (or one skill die, if you’re using deﬁned limits) per number.
Advantages cost creation points, while Disadvantages give you creation points (or skill dice). Thus, a Rank 1 Advantage costs one point
or die, while a Rank 4 Disadvantage gives you four points or dice.
The cost of one rank of the Special Ability is included in parentheses.
Some Special Abilities, such as Immortality, do not lend themselves
to being taken more than once. Players may also add Limitations
to their Special Abilities, which reduce their eﬀectiveness (and the
cost), or Enhancements, which increase their eﬀectiveness (and the
cost); these are described at the end of this section.
In settings where characters with Special Abilities are common,
additional ranks of each Special Ability cost one point (or skill die)
per rank at character creation. In settings where characters with
Special Abilities are uncommon, additional ranks of each Special
Ability cost the value listed with the Special Ability. As one instance,
the total cost of two ranks of Iron Will in a game where Special Abilities are uncommon is four, while in a game where they are common,
the cost is three.
When using templates or deﬁned limits for attributes and skill
dice, players may use skill dice or dice received from Disadvantages
to get Advantages and Special Abilities. Players in games using
character creation point pools may use some of the points in their
pool or points gained from Disadvantages to purchase Advantages
and Special Abilities.

Disadvantages
Many Disadvantages exist as counterparts to the Advantages
or Special Abilities listed herein. A Skill Bonus Special Ability is the
positive end of a Hindrance Disadvantage. Some have roleplaying
eﬀects, while others alter attributes and skills.
When choosing Disadvantages, keep a few things in mind:
1. You’re going to have to live with the Disadvantage. Take
only Disadvantages that you don’t expect to ever get rid of — there
are rules for eliminating Disadvantages, but the gamemaster may
allow their use only after lots of adventuring.
2. Choose more roleplaying Disadvantages than gamemechanic ones. Instead of taking easy-to-use modiﬁers to skill
attempts or abilities, select Disadvantages that you can roleplay.
Granted, you won’t want to have an overwhelming number of either
type of Disadvantage, but Disadvantages that can be roleplayed and
can work themselves into an adventure story are much more interesting than simple modiﬁers to diﬃculty numbers.

Note: At character creation, the ﬁrst rank in a
Special Ability costs the number in parentheses
in creation points or skill dice. Additional ranks
cost one creation point or skill die in games
where Special Abilities are common, or the
number in parentheses in games where Special
Abilities are uncommon. Enhancements add to
the total cost of the Special Ability. Limitations
subtract from the total of the base cost of the
Special Ability plus the cost of its ranks plus
the cost of its Enhancements. The minimum
cost for a Special Ability plus Enhancements
and Limitations is 1.

3. The Disadvantage has to be a disadvantage. Any Disadvantage that can be easily worked around, no matter how potent, or that
actually helps the character on a regular basis is not a Disadvantage.
For example, if a character has an Advantage Flaw where he can’t use
his Advantage when the temperature is below 60, and the character
is always adventuring in places where the temperature is at least
that high, then it is not a Disadvantage. Check all Disadvantages
(and other character options, for that matter) with your gamemaster
and explain to him what you think they mean before you start playing the game. That way, you can avoid this problem before it crops
up. Gamemasters who ﬁgure out the player was purposely trying
to break the system may take away the Disadvantage and an equal
amount of Advantages, Special Abilities, and maybe even Character
and Fate Points.

Achilles’ Heel (R3)
The character has a particular serious weakness. It is not something
that most other characters ﬁnd especially dangerous or inconvenient,

Chapter 2

• Page 18

as many meals per day as the average Human. For instance, the character must eat a meal every four hours or, every hour after the four
are up, the character lose one Body Point that cannot be recovered
except by eating. As another example, three times per day, a diﬀerent character may need to eat twice as much as a normal Human or
suﬀer a Stunned Wound level.
Nutritional Requirements: The character must ingest an element not commonly consumed by Humans (blood, dead Human ﬂesh,
etc.) to survive. Often, the character encounters prejudice because
of this, and she certainly develops physical problems if she fails to
consume this substance in a reasonable amount of time.
Rot: The character’s body is rotting. She periodically loses pieces
of herself (such as ﬁngers or toes) and must pause to fuse them
back on (this is a simple action but takes a round to perform). The
character suﬀers no damage from this, but it should inconvenience
her. For instance, in combat, the character’s ﬁngers might fall oﬀ,
causing her to drop her weapon — this makes an excellent Critical
Failure complication.
Vulnerability: A particular form of attack or interaction aﬀects
the character much more severely than other characters. For example,
a character with a vulnerability to close combat weapons might “freeze
up” when he sees another character point a sword at him — making
the other character +5 to hit him (most likely during the ﬁrst round
of combat only). Another character might automatically apply +10
to the diﬃculty of any attempts to resist another character’s bluﬀ
attempts. (The less likely the situation is to occur, the greater the
diﬃculty modiﬁer.)

but the character suﬀers severe modiﬁers to diﬃculties or even damage when exposed to it. Some examples include:
Allergy: The character is strongly aﬀected by reasonably common
things that she cannot always avoid. When exposed to the allergen, the
character must generate a Moderate Physique or stamina total (as an
action) or she takes 3D in damage. The character can resist the damage through applicable defenses, but she has to generate the stamina
total as an action every round she is exposed to the allergen.
Cultural Allergy: The same as above, but there is some social
situation that causes the character to freeze (exposure to nudity,
the sight of soldiers, etc.) and lose all Critical Success rerolls until
the condition is gone.
Environmental Incompatibility: The character is sensitive
to something in the environment: an extreme of temperature, the
chemical content of rain water, a component of the atmosphere, or
something similar. Exposure to this without the proper protection
causes the character to take a -4 modiﬁer to his damage resistance total
or a +1 modiﬁer to all diﬃculties (which increases by +1 per minute
exposed) until the character is out of the harmful situation.
Example: Forests generally have a lot of mold from leaves rotting.
A character from a race that lives primarily near mountain tops may
ﬁnd the airborne mold to be suﬀocating. He would have to devise
some sort of ﬁlter to walk through a forest without injury.
Metabolic Diﬀerence: The character needs more life support
(typically food) than “normal” and begins to take damage after hours
of malnutrition. For food, the character eats the equivalent of twice

Restrictions/Notes: The Achilles’ Heel should be very serious,
but not “instant death” for the character. There should always exist
some way to avoid it (not easily), or some chance that the character
can counter it. The more likely it aﬀects the character, the less it actually should do. It’s equally possible that the Achilles’ Heel imposes
diﬀerent modiﬁers under diﬀerent circumstances.
Example: A character who has allergy to small airborne particles
might and suﬀer +3 to the diﬃculty of all actions when in a dusty
room or riding in a vehicle on a dirt track but +5 when in a desert.
Or, the character might suﬀer 3D in damage every time he’s in a
dusty place.

Achilles’ Heel (R4)
The character’s weakness is even more severe than the Rank 3
version of this Disadvantage. Some examples include:
Allergy: The same rules apply as for Allergy, save that the character cannot perform any actions except running away while exposed
to the allergen.
Cultural Allergy: The same rules apply as for Cultural Allergy
(R3), save that not only does the character lose all Critical Success
rerolls if exposed to the speciﬁed social situations, she also is at +1
to all diﬃculties.
Environmental Incompatibility: The modiﬁer to the damage
resistance total goes up, or the condition is more likely to occur, or
the modiﬁer increases each round.
Rot: The character loses major parts of his body periodically due
to rotting (such as limbs) and must pause to replace them. Doing so

Character Options

• Page 19

requires no skill total but does take three rounds to perform. The
trigger that causes this to take eﬀect should occur no less frequently
than a Critical Failure.

Restrictions/Notes: In general, at Rank 1, a ﬂaw should not
debilitate a character or take away his Advantage on a regular basis
— but it should make it a little less of a sure thing.

Symbiosis: The character is bound symbiotically to another, drawing strength or energy from her. Symbiosis can be either physical or
mental. For every 100 meters by which one character is separated
from the other, the character loses one pip (cumulative) to either
their physical attributes (Agility, Coordination, and Physique) or their
mental attributes (Intellect, Acumen, or Charisma). (Remember: three
pips equal one die.) If the character’s symbiote is killed, the character
loses 1D from the attributes aﬀected until she can convince another
character to willingly bond with her (the bonding process should be
simple — like sharing blood — but participants must willingly want
it to happen). For an extra rank in this Disadvantage, the character
is bound both mentally and physically to another, and loses from
both sets of attributes if separated. For the separation to equally
aﬀect the “host,” he must also have this version of the Achilles’ Heel
Disadvantage.

Advantage Flaw (R2)

Restrictions/Notes: Additional ranks of the Achilles’ Heel Disadvantage indicate even more deadly situations. See Achilles’ Heel
(R3) for other notes.

Advantage Flaw (R1)
This Disadvantage is linked to a particular Advantage or set of
skills. Whenever the character uses it, there is some a chance for a
negative modiﬁer or roleplaying disadvantage. Here are some examples
for certain Advantages and skills:
Contacts: The Contact helps the character, but he is either “annoying” about it or a “hard bargainer.” Where a normal Contact would
assist the character for an almost negligible fee, the Flawed Contact
will haggle and nag until “rewarded.” Some reason should exist why
the character would want to keep the contact happy.
Cultures: When the character gets hints or knowledge about a
culture, he knows everything except some sort of critical piece of
information. Or, if the character has the “sweeping knowledge” of lots
of cultures, his interpretations sometimes are almost totally wrong
(gamemaster option). In order to make this Flaw work, the character
should not ﬁnd out about the error until it would be “interesting.”
Equipment: In most cases, some sort of minor mechanical
imperfection exists in the equipment that no normal means can ﬁx.
For equipment that requires a skill total, gamemasters could either
add 3 to the diﬃculty of all actions using it, or, on a Critical Failure,
the equipment won’t work or malfunctions. For equipment that
wouldn’t normally require a skill total, occasional side eﬀects could
happen or maybe it requires a periodic Moderate skill check of some
kind to keep operating.
Skills: If the character fails at the skill check with one of a set of
three related skills, she can’t reroll Critical Successes either until the
end of the scene or until she succeeds at the skill check.
Wealth or Funds: The character cannot access his wealth easily. Either it is tied up in red tape most of the time (especially if the
character has most of the money invested), or he has to go somewhere
to get it (such as having a fortune back East while adventuring in the
Wild West), or someone else (reasonably friendly) has control over
it and doesn’t always release it easily.

This Disadvantage works in exactly the same manner as Advantage
Flaw (R1), above, but with more serious results. If the Flaw came into
play occasionally (like every time the character visited a desert), it
now comes into play much more frequently (like when he is in any
dry environment). If the Flaw made things a little more diﬃcult, then
the Flaw makes things a lot more diﬃcult (the diﬃculty modiﬁer
doubles from the Rank 1 version).
Restrictions/Notes: Having circumstances that eﬀectively take
away the complete beneﬁt of the Advantage is certainly within the
bounds of Advantage Flaw (R2), and those circumstances can occur
reasonably often (no more than during one quarter of a normal
adventure, however). They will force the player to roleplay and to
think about ways to get around the Flaw or to try other options,
rather than just relying on a particular Advantage, Special Ability,
or skill set.
Example: If a character has a set of skills with the Flaw that they
only work at night — a Rank 2 Flaw if only about a quarter of the
character’s normal adventuring occurs during the daytime — that
would force the character to rely on other abilities and his wits during the daytime.
The rules for Advantage Flaw (R2) are otherwise the same as
Rank 1.

Advantage Flaw (R3)
This rank takes on some of the characteristics of an Achilles’ Heel
(R3), but more in direct relationship to an Advantage, an attribute,
or a large set of skills. The rules for the ﬂaw are the same as for
Advantage Flaw (R2), but the eﬀects are even more severe. Not only
does the character lose the beneﬁts of the Advantage or attribute (or
undergoes a condition that essentially negates it), but he also suﬀers
an additional Disadvantage.
Example: Your character has this Disadvantage attached to her
Miracles attribute. You and the gamemaster decide that her religion
so focuses on peace and tranquility that clerics can’t use their miraculous abilities while in or near stressful situations, such as arguments
or battles. Furthermore, if she must use her gifts then, she loses all
Critical Success rerolls for the rest of the scene.
Example: A character has Equipment (R3) — a really powerful
magical bow. But, whenever the character suﬀers a Critical Failure
using the weapon, the bow not only stops working, the character
experiences some sort of feedback at a moderate damage total
(maybe the weapon’s normal damage minus a speciﬁc amount). The
character then has to get the magic reactivated (either through the
use of a Price Disadvantage or by waiting until a major break in the
adventure’s action, most likely).
Some other examples:
Infection: Under certain circumstances, the character passes
along select abilities and characteristics to another character. The
character has an infection score of Physique +2D. (This is not a skill

Chapter 2
and players may not raise it except by taking additional ranks in this
version of the Disadvantage.)
The gamemaster and the player should determine how the character spreads the infection. It could happen as the side eﬀect of an
attack, through physical contact, or through some other means.
When the character performs the requisite action, he generates an
infection total (which does not count as a separate action). The target
generates a Physique or stamina total as well (which does not count as
an action). If the character’s infection total exceeds (not equals) the
target’s Physique or stamina total, the target is infected.
An infection passes certain Special Abilities and Disadvantages
to the target (speciﬁed by the player and the gamemaster when the
player gives the character this Disadvantage). It is possible for the
infection to pass on more ranks in Disadvantages than Special Abilities, but is not possible for it to pass more ranks in Special Abilities
than Disadvantages.
Keep in mind that the infected character may well hate the character responsible for his new state, so the infecting character may
have gained an Enemy. In fact, there should exist some overwhelming
reasons why this is actually bad for the infecting character — it is a
Disadvantage, after all.
Gamemasters who do not feel that the Enemy Disadvantage is
enough of a negative could also work in other sorts of Advantage
Flaws as side eﬀects of spreading the infection.
For an extra rank in the Advantage Flaw: Infection Disadvantage,
the infection die code increases to Physique+4D. Also, the penalties
for infecting another characters should be more severe — maybe the
character infected then knows things about the infecting character
that will give him an advantage over his enemy, or perhaps the infecting character temporarily loses abilities or attribute pips.
Minor Stigma: There is something that the character cannot
do without performing the “proper rituals” before or after (a ﬁghter
whose cult must “purify” him after killing someone; a wizard who
cannot use Magic without special equipment).
Stench: The character smells terrible due to one of his Advantages
or just because he exists. Add 6 to the diﬃculty of all stealth attempts,
as everyone can smell him coming. This also aﬀects interaction
attempts, giving them at least a +1 to the diﬃculty.
Restrictions/Notes: Advantage Flaw (R3) takes a powerful
Advantage and turns it into a worse-than-useless Disadvantage for
a comparatively brief period of time. A single Advantage can have
more than one Advantage Flaw, and, if the character wants several
Flaws of various ranks, can link to one Advantage. See other ranks
of Advantage Flaw for more information and examples.

Age (R1)
The character is a teenager or just past middle age. And, since this
is a roleplaying game and not real life, he’ll stay that way. In general,
characters who are “too young” often have to roleplay through episodes where they are not taken seriously, where they are ignored, and
where they have less rights and control than older characters. Those
who are “too old” get treated in much the same way — characters in
their prime often defer to the character, but they also treat him as
if he were inﬁrm or possibly senile.
Restrictions/Notes: In general, the gamemaster should try to
treat the character as if he were “too old” or “too young” and have

• Page 20

fun with it. Game mechanics are seldom required, as good roleplaying
can make things work here, but if they become necessary, add 3 to
the diﬃculty of intimidation and persuasion actions performed by the
character when his age would interfere (a young character trying to
lead a group of experienced characters, or an older character trying
to convince younger characters that he is “with it”). A character may
only have one version of Age.

Age (R2)
The Disadvantage is the same, only more so. Instead of being a
teenager, the character is a preteen child. Instead of being just past
middle age, the character is old. The roleplaying situations are basically the same, but the eﬀects are more dramatic.
Restrictions/Notes: An old character receives +1 to the diﬃculty
of physical actions — those that rely on Agility, Coordination, and
Physique — requiring unusual exertion (running, jumping, ﬁghting,
etc.). A young character adds 1 to the diﬃculty of all mental actions
— those that use Intellect, Acumen, or Charisma — when attempting to solve “adult” problems or interact with adults. Players should
roleplay both versions true to type. Two Disadvantages suitable for
association with this one include Reduced Attribute (especially for
Age: Old) and Hindrance.
Characters may be “young” or “old” and not take this Disadvantage. Older characters in good shape have no problems jogging, lifting, ﬁghting, or whatever, and young, intelligent people can often
interact and think just as well — if not better — than adults. This
Disadvantage addresses those characters, young and old, who can’t
keep up as easily.

Character Options

Bad Luck (R2)
The character is exceptionally unlucky. This Disadvantage is under
the gamemaster’s control most of the time. The easiest way to handle
it is, whenever the player rolls a Critical Failure but something bad
happens (in addition to taking away the highest die in the roll). The
gamemaster can choose from not allowing the player to reroll Critical
Successes until the end of the scene, the character loses an action
during the next round, or invoking some sort of strange but not too
terrible “bad luck eﬀect.”
Example: A character with Bad Luck is running from a warlord
and his army, who he’s been ﬁghting for some time. He tries to jump
across a chasm when the player rolls a Critical Failure on the dice.
Well, the character probably failed in the jumping attempt (so he falls),
but, instead of being able to grab for a lower ledge, the character’s
cloak gets caught on a hook. Now, the character has to free himself
before the soldiers come and shoot him full of arrows.
Restrictions/Notes: A character may take Bad Luck (R2) if he
already has the Good Luck or Great Luck Special Ability. The character
might even, on occasion, use the beneﬁts of the Good Luck or Great
Luck Special Ability to get out of trouble or partially negate the eﬀects
of Bad Luck (R2) — that’s the way it works. Also, the gamemaster
should remember that the character has Bad Luck (R2) — not the
player. If the player gets into a consistent “streak” of rolling Critical
Failures on the dice, then the gamemaster should start “skipping” the
invocation of Bad Luck (R2) occasionally — more than three or four
occurrences of Bad Luck (R2) during an adventure is a little much.

Bad Luck (R3)
The rules for this Disadvantage are the same as for Bad Luck (R2).
However, a Critical Failure or a total equal to one more than the die
code of the skill or attribute causes Bad Luck (R3) to activate. (For
example, if the character has 5D in a skill and rolls a total of 6 on
the dice — which is one more than the die code in the skill — the
Disadvantage comes into play.) The eﬀects are exactly the same, only
the gamemaster might make the setbacks more uncomfortable.
Restrictions/Notes: See Bad Luck (R2).

Bad Luck (R4)
The same as Bad Luck (R2) and Bad Luck (R3), but the character
suﬀers the eﬀects on a Critical Failure or a total equal to or less than
two more than the die code of the skill or attribute. (So, if the character
with a skill of 5D rolls a 6 or 7, then the Disadvantage is activated.)
The minimum eﬀect is that the character loses her actions on the
round and probably something disastrous happens.
Restrictions/Notes: See Bad Luck (R2) and Bad Luck (R3). Since
Bad Luck (R3) can have such devastating eﬀects, the gamemaster
might want to overrule occurrences of it. For example, if, during a
standard scene of an adventure, a character is trying to persuade a
shopkeeper to sell him an item at a better price, he might roll a low
total on the dice. The gamemaster could have something disastrous
happen — the shopkeeper keels over with a heart attack just as the
chief of the city watch walks in and the character is suddenly suspected of murder — but does it serve any purpose in the adventure?
Possibly, but if it doesn’t, save it until later. Then, when the character
is at the climax of the adventure and he doesn’t roll a disastrously

• Page 21
Wild Luck
The character has the weirdest luck. To simulate this, the
player takes for his character an equal number of points (not
ranks) in the Bad Luck Disadvantage and in any version of the
Luck Special Ability. In situations where the Bad Luck could be
triggered or Luck could be activated, the gamemaster rolls a
six-sided die. On an odd number, the Bad Luck occurs. On an
even number, the Luck Special Ability happens (and the player
may choose which Luck beneﬁt his character gets).

low total — but the gamemaster feels a “dose of bad luck” would
improve the story — he can use that as an excuse. Players should
understand that Bad Luck is arbitrary and will often occur at the
worst possible moment.

Burn-out (R1 or more)
Under a certain set of proscribed circumstances, the Advantage
goes away — permanently. The player and the gamemaster should
work out the circumstances, with the following criteria:
1. The Burn-out should have a chance of occurring about once or
twice an adventure.
2. The Burn-out should be something the character can avoid
— but she might not want to avoid it.
3. A logical reason for the Burn-out to occur should exist.
4. Both the player and the gamemaster operate under the knowledge that the Burn-out will occur at some point.
Some examples of when a Burn-out could occur include:
• An opponent soundly defeats the character in an adventure.
• The character completes a particular quest of great importance
(this would probably only happen after several adventures but is
something the character wants to complete for some reason).
• The character suﬀers a particular eﬀect (she loses most of her
Body Points or Wounds, she is the victim of a particular type of
uncommon attack, etc.).
• A character’s Advantage is somehow negated (a Contact who has
a good chance of being killed, a piece of Equipment that someone is
trying to steal or destroy, etc.).
This Disadvantage is worth a number of ranks equal to one-half
(rounded up) of the Advantage with which it’s associated.
Restrictions/Notes: Any Advantage could have the possibility of
Burn-out. Just think of a logical (or, perhaps, supernatural) reason
an Advantage would go away. There should exist a decent chance
that it could go away, but the character should have some chance of
avoiding that occurrence … for a while.

Cultural Unfamiliarity (R1)
The character is not from the “mainstream” culture of the society
he spends the most time in. The player should decide on the character’s
native kingdom, which is somewhere with a diﬀerent culture than
the one he is normally in. For instance, a Dwarf character might be
in a setting where Dwarves and Humans generally get along. How-

Chapter 2
ever, because Dwarves and Humans have diﬀerent, there might be
the occasional “cultural clashes.” Bigots might get in the way of the
character, and the character might not always “know” things about
the setting that natives would automatically understand. The character is an outsider.
Restrictions/Notes: At the worst, gamemasters can treat the
Disadvantage like Prejudice (R1), but, most often, the character is
just unfamiliar with aspects of the mainstream. Characters cannot
usually take this Disadvantage more than once.

Cultural Unfamiliarity (R2)
The character is of a culture almost totally diﬀerent from the “mainstream” he operates in. The character should constantly make mistakes
and social gaﬀs. All attempts at streetwise or similar “getting around
town” skills should have +6 to the diﬃculty (at least). In addition, the
character should probably have trouble with the native language (he
could even take the Disadvantage Language Problems).
Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Cultural
Unfamiliarity (R1).

Cultural Unfamiliarity (R3)
The character is, in all respects, an alien. He’s probably from
another region with a completely diﬀerent culture, or whatever ﬁts
the game setting. Regardless, he just doesn’t ﬁt in (socially, and, most
likely, physically). Otherwise, this Disadvantage works exactly the
same way as the other rank versions.
Restrictions/Notes: See Cultural Unfamiliarity (R1).

Debt (R1)

• Page 22

somewhere dangerous and doing something suicidal), the character
has to drop everything and go.
Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Debt (R1).

Debt (R3)
The character owes almost everything to someone or something. In
the case of worldly goods, the character must turn over nearly everything to the “lender” at the end of an adventure — the character must
“borrow” these things back at the beginning of the next adventure ...
and it is up to the gamemaster what the “lender” gives back.
In most cases, this means the character is either Employed or
under some similar sort of restriction.
Example: Your character might belong to a particularly strict
cult or religion. She has to tithe all worldly goods (or, at least, a
large portion of worldly goods) to the cult after every adventure. If
she does not, she would be cast out — a fate she would not enjoy
— or even hunted and killed. At the beginning of each adventure,
the character must beg and persuade whoever is in charge to let her
have any goods she needs.
Restrictions/Notes: Debt (R3) is so wide-sweeping that players may not usually combine in it with the lower versions or link to
individual Advantages unless the player and the gamemaster are
particularly inventive. A character with Debt (R3) might “owe” the
possession of a Rank 3 or Rank 4 Advantage to a particular source (a
character might have receive Equipment from a supernatural source)
and have to pay some sort of tithe (a sacriﬁce, all the money the
character obtains, etc.) to get the use of the Advantage.

Devotion (R1)

The character owes money, or something else valuable, to someone.
In most cases, some sort of lending institution or credit house exists,
and the payments aren’t too arduous. The character just has a harder
time getting credit and has to turn over a substantial amount of any
proﬁts he makes on an adventure to the lender.

The character feels compelled to take certain actions out of love,
code of honor, or perceived duty to something or someone else. The
character may, at times, do things he ﬁnds morally questionable in
order to achieve a greater good. With Devotion (R1), the character’s
beliefs do not come into play very often.

Restrictions/Notes: Players should take this Disadvantage if
they intend for their characters to live up to it. The character should
have a reason he doesn’t want to default on the debt, which the player
works out beforehand. Also, Debt (any rank) with Enemy (any rank)
can be an interesting combination — maybe the character is in deep
to a loan shark or a manipulative and unscrupulous lender.
A character may have this Disadvantage with the Advantage Wealth
(any rank), as long as there is some reason it can’t be just paid oﬀ. A
character with Wealth (R3) (phenomenal resources) might be stuck
in a contract where he has to turn over the proﬁts of any adventure
to someone, for example — he still has his wealth, but he has to
cough up all the little neat things and rewards he gets at the end of
the adventure (or the character has to persuade the lender/contract
holder to let him keep them).

Devotion (R2)

Debt (R2)
The character owes a lot of money (or something else valuable) to
someone dangerous, or the results of owing this debt are dangerous.
For instance, the character could owe his life to a really strange old
wizard, and, every time that person needs a favor (usually going oﬀ

The character with the Devotion (R2) Disadvantage believes very
strongly in something and will attempt to persuade others of the
truth of his beliefs. His patriotism or loyalty to an ideal plays a role
in his day-to-day life.

Devotion (R3)
At this rank, the character’s belief in the cause motivates almost
all his actions. The character would willingly die for her belief. Additionally, her duties to the object of her devotion increase.

Employed (R1)
The character has a job, an apprenticeship, ties to a religious order,
fealty ties, or other social bonds that request frequent attention. He
may need to perform certain deeds, rituals, or prayers on a monthly
or daily basis to stay connected to his employer (and generally receive
beneﬁts thereof). The more complex the requirements, the less often
they need be done. Maybe the job relates to what the character wants
to do during adventures, or maybe not. Regardless, the character

Character Options
wants to keep her job (or has to, for some reason), and she must take
responsibility for missing work and fulﬁlling her obligations.
Restrictions/Notes: The player and the gamemaster might have
to work to roleplay this, but an occasional conﬂict should arise between
what the character wants to do and what she has to do. The character
might even have to keep some activities secret or lose her job.
Some examples include a bard attached to a household; a monk
who must regularly check in with his religious order; mercenary or
bounty hunter under contract; bodyguard; and city watch. The less
freedom the character has in making decisions during the adventure
and what she wants to do during her working hours (and perhaps
even her spare time), the greater the rank in Employed.

Employed (R2)
The character works for someone, or something, that pretty
much runs his life. When he goes on adventures, he either has to
go through lots of red tape to get permission, or it’s because he was
assigned the mission. As a result, the character has little free will
regarding what he does or how he does it, and he should come into
conﬂict with his employer on occasion. Also, since the character is
an employee, if he is on a mission, he usually has to turn over his
share of the loot for corporate disposal — he’ll get something out
of it, certainly, but not a full share.
Restrictions/Notes: The rules are the same as for Employed (R1).
Just make sure that “the job” is fairly inconvenient for the character, but there are reasons he doesn’t quit. Maybe he has the Wealth
Advantage only so long as he has the Employed (R2) Disadvantage
— that would be a good way of tying in the Disadvantage.

• Page 23

Employed (R3)
The character is, for all intents and purposes, a slave. This does
not mean the character is poor or without means — just without free
choice. The character does virtually everything because he must. For
example, a character might be the head of a large guild. But the only
way things get done is for the character to do them or be there to
oversee their getting done. Adventures only occur when they are in
direct concordance with the interests of the “employer.” In all other
ways, this Disadvantage is like its lower rank versions.
Restrictions/Notes: See Employed under the other ranks.

Enemy (R1)
An individual or group has it in for the character. An Enemy who is
a single person of power and inﬂuence no greater than the character
might actually want the character dead. An Enemy (R1) of power and
inﬂuence greater than the character simply wants to hassle the character for some reason. Maybe in the town the character operates, the
law enforcement authorities have his name and picture on ﬁle — and
they’ll use any excuse to run him in or hassle him because they think
of him as a troublemaker. Or, perhaps, the character’s evil stepfather
throws everything out on the street if he’s one minute late with the
rent, or the character’s liege always assigns him the most boring or
most dangerous missions. The Enemy does not have to have a position in the character’s life — he can just be someone who, for some
reason known to the gamemaster (and probably the player, but not
always the character), has a grudge against the character.
Restrictions/Notes: There is no reason a player can’t use this
Disadvantage similarly to an Advantage Flaw or as a complement
to other Disadvantages or even Advantages. Maybe a character’s
Contact is sweet and helpful (a noblewoman in the court who tells
the character a little more about the mission he’s been assigned), but
someone who inﬂuences the Contact is an Enemy (the noblewoman’s
advisor who has been trying to seduce her and resents the fact that
she likes the character better) and sometimes makes it hard for the
contact to help. Enemy (R1) characters should either show up only
occasionally (maybe once during an adventure), or they should be
minor annoyances that can only be a real problem if the character
doesn’t deal with them when they show up. Multiple Enemies of
various ranks can be selected (just don’t go overboard).

Enemy (R2)
The rules are the same as for Enemy (R1), only the character is more
powerful, more annoying, and/or more a part of the character’s life.
Restrictions/Notes: It should be mentioned that killing the
Enemy or running away should not get rid of the Disadvantage
— at least not easily. At the very least, the character should have
to go though a few adventures to “remove” the Enemy from his life.
Usually, the character has to deal with the Enemy for quite a long
time. Multiple Enemies can, of course, be selected.

Enemy (R3)
Again, the rules are the same as for Enemy (R1) and Enemy (R2).
Most likely, a group of people or a very powerful person hounds the
character, wishing to kill or otherwise remove the character from

Chapter 2
the game setting. They often hurt people she knows and do vile
deeds just because the character won’t like them. The Enemy (R3)
should get involved in, directly or indirectly, most adventures the
character goes on. Just about everything bad that happens to the
character would please the Enemy — and he is probably responsible
for a lot of them.
Restrictions/Notes: Enemy (R3) is a very powerful, and very
important, Disadvantage. Many beginning gamemasters might not
want to go to the trouble of creating and constantly maintaining a villain
or group of villains relating to the character — but others will enjoy it.
Talk to your gamemaster about this option before you select it.

Hindrance (R1 or more)
The character has a minor physical or mental handicap that
makes certain actions more diﬃcult. The Hindrance could
be a permanent physical injury, a particular mental block
regarding certain types of activities, a limitation innate to
the character’s race, or the result of age.
The player and the gamemaster should work out some sort
of aﬄiction and then choose a group of related skills that get
diﬃculty modiﬁers totaling +3. Some examples of sets of three
skills getting a +1 modiﬁer to the diﬃculty of each include:
Bad Knee: acrobatics, jumping, running
Gruﬀness or Arrogance: bluﬀ, charm, persuasion
Trick Shoulder: climbing, melee combat, throwing
Uncoordinated: acrobatics, melee combat, sleight of hand
Unobservant: investigation, speaking, search
The players may use this Disadvantage to restrict one form
of their characters’ movement. A two-meter reduction in one
form of movement (running, swimming, jumping, or climbing)
is equivalent to a +1 diﬃculty modiﬁer, so a player could take a
small movement restriction along with diﬃculty modiﬁers to skills.
The minimum movement rate for a character is one meter.
Characters with a native environment requiring an alternative
means of movement other than walking (such as swimming or burrowing) may take one rank of Hindrance: Atypical Move to represent
the inability to walk or jump. Instead, the character uses his base
Move to represent his base swimming or burrowing Move. Thus, a
water-dwelling character without legs and with this type of Hindrance
would have a swimming Move of 10 (instead of 5), could not walk,
and would be limited in the kind of jumping he could perform.
Players who wish to reduce their characters’ damage resistance
total (to represent delicate physical natures) may take a -1 modiﬁer
to that total for each rank in this Disadvantage.
Restrictions/Notes: Players may use specializations — with
gamemaster approval. Three specializations that the gamemaster
thinks the player might have to use reasonably often (like investigation: ﬁnd clues or marksmanship: bows) could substitute for one
general skill. Hindrance (R1) can be selected several times, as long
as the gamemaster thinks it appropriate. Since it is very much the
counterpart to the Skill Bonus Special Ability, additional restrictions
and notes can be related to the ones found there.
Each additional rank in Hindrance increases the total diﬃculty
modiﬁer by +3, which may aﬀect the few skills in a Rank 1 group, or
can increase the number of skills covered by the Hindrance.

• Page 24

Infamy (R1)
The character is about as well known as a character with Fame
(R1), but for diﬀerent reasons. The odds of being recognized are the
same as for Fame (R1), but the reaction is quite diﬀerent. The character experiences hostility, prejudice, and intentional slights — in
game mechanic terms, the character should have the diﬃculty of all
interactions increased by at least +3.
Restrictions/Notes: There is a reason for this negative attention. Either the character did something, is accused of having done
something, or is suspected of having done something not particularly
pleasant, or the character has, through other strange circumstances,
earned a “bad rep.” Sometimes, this Infamy will help the character
— but it shouldn’t help too much. If the character has a combination of Fame and Infamy (by selecting both options), then
maybe he’s earned a reputation like Robin Hood — certain
people would look up to him or respect him, and there would
be deﬁnite fear there most of the time, but there would also
be a lot of people who would enjoy seeing the person leave or
die. Of course, Infamy (R1) should be something minor — maybe
the character is a former criminal, or he did something questionable
in the past and was cleared. People are not overtly hostile, but they
are unfriendly when they recognize him. Several ranks of Infamy
can only be selected if the character is infamous for multiple reasons
— but the eﬀects should be cumulative, and this can only be done
if the gamemaster thinks it is appropriate. A character with Infamy
(R3) would hardly have to worry about Infamy (R1) in most cases,
so it would not be a proper combination.

Infamy (R2)
The character is, most likely, wanted for a crime of a fairly serious
nature, or he did something (or is thought to have done something)
in the past that makes him hated and reviled by most people.
The rules are essentially the same as for Infamy (R1) and the
recognition chances are similar to Fame (R2), but the modiﬁer
to interactions usually should be at least +6.
Restrictions/Notes: As stated under Infamy (R1), unless combined with Fame, this Disadvantage only allows for the negative
aspects of notoriety. A character who has Infamy (R2) would be
considered by nearly everyone (but not everyone) to be “scum” and
someone who “deserves no better than he gets.” When combined
with an equal or higher rank of Fame, there is often that “fear and
respect” option — many characters will still try to betray or hurt the
character in some way, but most won’t be that open about it.

Infamy (R3)
The character has trouble going out in public because a lot of
people hate her to the point of violence. Chances are good that, if
she fails an interaction (with a +9 to the diﬃculty), the other person
will drive her away. The player could select Enemy (R1) in addition to
this Disadvantage to reﬂect those hunting her. However, the character could use disguises and avoid populated areas. Most likely, the
character has to move around until she can “live down” her infamy
(if ever) or until she dies.
Restrictions/Notes: See Infamy (R1) and Infamy (R2).

Character Options

Language Problems (R2)

Prejudice (R2)

The character does not understand the language of the area she
spends most of her time in. She must learn skill pips in the specialization speaking: (local language). Otherwise, she receives a +6 diﬃculty
modiﬁers in addition to any other modiﬁers for what she’s attempting
to convey or understand.

The minority group the character belongs to is oppressed. The
character experiences disparity virtually every day. While other
characters of the same minority group may not actually experience
this prejudice (that is, they didn’t select this option), it is probably
because they aren’t in positions where this discrimination can be
easily practiced.

Restrictions/Notes: The character cannot begin the game with
more than one pip in speaking: (local language), but she may improve
the skill at +2 to the cost. However, the character should speak another
language in the game setting ﬂuently.

Learning Problems (R1 or more)
When the character attempts to learn a new skill, or improve
an old one, he does so at +2 per rank to the Character Point cost.
Alternatively, the character can only learn or improve a skill if she
attempts it and fails. A character should have to fail with a single
skill at least three times per adventure before being allowed to learn
or improve the skill.
This Disadvantage is associated with a single attribute, and it
applies to specializations. There should be some sort of reason for
this in the character’s background, such as diﬃculty reading or a
lack of education.
Restrictions/Notes: This is the counterpart to the Quick Study
Special Ability, and it should be treated in much the same way. This
Disadvantage can be taken multiple times, either for the same attribute
(with a cumulative increase in skill cost) or for diﬀerent attributes.

Poverty (R1)
Since characters who adventure tend to accumulate wealth, this
Disadvantage is only available at Rank 1. The character begins the
game with the shirt on his back and, maybe, a few pieces of cheap and
substandard equipment. The character should also have the attitude of
someone who is “poor,” whatever that might be in the game setting.
If using Funds as an attribute, this Disadvantage subtracts 10
from relevant totals.
Restrictions/Notes: As an excellent combination, this Disadvantage could be selected with Debt or Price to make the situation
more realistic. Poverty can only be selected once.

Prejudice (R1)
The character is of a minority group — or maybe it is just the
character himself — that is subject to prejudice and discrimination.
The character receives modiﬁers (from +2 to +4) to diﬃculties during
normal interaction with characters not of the minority group, and is
generally treated unfairly by society. The group the character belongs
to, or the reason he is discriminated against, should be identiﬁed
when the character gets this Disadvantage, and the player should
know how he can expect to be treated in most cases.
Restrictions/Notes: The gamemaster has to be careful with this
one. It is hard to roleplay a prejudice without getting too carried
away and being oﬀensive to someone. When used in a setting where
there are many diﬀerent intelligent races, however, it can be quite
interesting — especially if there are several characters in the group
who are prejudiced against.

Restrictions/Notes: The character often experiences discrimination, and most interactions are performed at a +3 to +6 to the
diﬃculty. This prejudice should be roleplayed at every opportunity.
However, gamemasters and players should only use this Disadvantage
when both sides are comfortable with using it in a pretend situation
(see Prejudice (R1) for more information).

Price (R1)
This is a Disadvantage similar to Advantage Flaw. But, instead of
there being something wrong with the character’s Advantage or a set
of three related skills, there is a “price tag” attached. Every time the
character wants to use the ability, he has to pay a Price at least a few
times during the adventure to continue using the ability.
The Price might be an actual fee — and a signiﬁcant one at that.
If the fee isn’t paid, the Advantage goes away until the price can be
paid. But this won’t work for many Advantages (at least not in an
interesting manner), so there are other ways to do it.
Most likely, the Price will be a roleplaying eﬀect. Maybe every
time a Contact does a favor for a character, he not only demands the
normal, negotiated recompense (if any), but the character must do
a favor of equal importance for the character. Or, whenever a piece

Chapter 2
of Equipment is used, parts of it need replacing or servicing by a
specialist (who may charge a high fee or ask a favor), most likely
after the adventure.
One more suggestion for Price (R1) would be that the character
has to pay one Fate Point or three Character Points at the end of an
adventure where the Advantage or skills were relied upon, to “pay
for” the usage. This reﬂects the fact that the use of the Advantage
takes something out of the character when it is used.

• Page 26

Restrictions/Notes: The Price should be fairly easy to meet,
but it should take some work. At this rank, it should be something
that the character can roleplay along with an adventure or resolve
between short adventures or parts of longer adventures (like paying
oﬀ the recipient of the Price). However, if the character does not pay
the Price, the Advantage does go away — and, if (in the gamemaster’s
opinion) the character does this too often, both the Advantage and
the Price should go away permanently. Price can be taken often at
various ranks, and the same Price can be linked to more than one
Advantage — though, unless the Price is actually double (the character has to pay the same price twice as often), it only counts as one
Disadvantage.

Price (R2)
The Price for using a particular Advantage, or group of Advantages
or set of three related skills, is much higher than mentioned in Rank
1, but the rules are the same. Contacts will be extremely hard to pay
oﬀ or do favors for — maybe an entire short adventure has to be
devoted to paying back a contact who helped out.
Optionally, paying two Fate Points or six Character Points at the
end of an adventure where the Advantage was used is a quick way
of paying the price.
Restrictions/Notes: See Price (R1).

Quirk (R1)
The character suﬀers from a personality quirk that makes certain
types of roleplaying and interaction more diﬃcult. This quirk could
simply be a habit or an mannerism that has gone too far, or it could
be a minor psychological problem. Some examples include:
Dependency: The character has a slight dependency on a substance or even a roleplaying event. The character might be a heavy
pipe smoker who, if he doesn’t smoke at least once every few hours
of game time, gets irritable and loses Critical Success rerolls during
interactions. Or maybe the character always has to have the last word
in any situation and will often beat an argument into the ground
rather than “lose.”
Kleptomania: When in a store or surrounded by small, portable
items, the character will occasionally try to “lift” something. When
possessed by his Quirk (see rules below), the character suﬀers +3
to the diﬃculty of sleight of hand, lockpicking, or related attempts at
theft because he really doesn’t know he’s doing it.
Indecision: The character does not like making decisions and
will delay making them. When roleplaying, the player should actively
participate in group discussions, but he should be wishy-washy and
indecisive at critical moments.
Stutter: When under pressure, relaxed, nervous (such as failing
a skill roll), or some other fairly common “mood” hits the character,

he stutters. The upshot is the character suﬀers +3 to the diﬃculty of
any interaction at this time, and the player should roleplay having
a hard time getting his ideas across to the other players. This lasts
until the player rolls a Critical Success.
Restrictions/Notes: Good roleplayers will have fun with these,
and other, Quirks that they come up with. Indeed, this Disadvantage is
often more fun to play than many Advantages — but the gamemaster
should make certain it is being roleplayed. Whenever the gamemaster
thinks it appropriate, he should make the player generate a mettle
or Charisma total against a base Moderate diﬃculty to “indulge” in
his Quirk automatically (that is, “suﬀer” for it). The negative eﬀects
of the Quirk immediately come into play. Also, if the character
repeatedly makes this roll, resisting the impulses of the Quirk, the
gamemaster should start modifying the diﬃculty upwards until the
character fails. Multiple Quirks can be selected.
The gamemaster may allow multiple inclusions of the same version
of this Disadvantage, with all modiﬁers cumulative and an increase
by +5 per inclusion to the mettle diﬃculty.
Additional Note: Some players may choose to have their characters roleplay Quirks they already have or might like to play. Sometimes
this works, sometimes it doesn’t. It can be hysterical to have a player
“steal” dice out from under another player’s nose (symbolizing the
fact that the character is taking necessary items away from the other
player’s character) as long as things don’t go too far ... that is, when
people start getting upset). However, players who are “indecisive”
should not play characters who are indecisive — since they would be
anyway. This is too much like getting a Disadvantage for nothing.

Character Options

Quirk (R2)
The rules for Quirk (R2) are the same as for Quirk (R1), only the
chance of occurrence is much greater and the eﬀects are larger.
Dependency: The character needs to fulﬁll his dependency much
more often (once a scene, perhaps). The character also experiences
one automatic Critical Failure per scene that he doesn’t (a smoker
might have a coughing ﬁt in the middle of a tense negotiation or
during a stealth attempt, for example).
Secret: There’s something about the character that she needs
to hide. If it were discovered, it would put her friends, family, and
even her own life at risk. This could be a civilian identity (if she has
a heroic alter ego) or a skeleton in the closet.
Restrictions/Notes: The diﬃculty of resisting the “impulse” is
now Diﬃcult, but all other rules are the same as under Quirk (R1).

Quirk (R3)
These “personality quirks” are much more serious. The character
might be a junkie, a psychotic with a certain type of behavior, or has
a severe phobia (he’s deathly afraid of something). Some examples:
Dependency: The character is a junkie, always after a “ﬁx.” The
“ﬁx” might be an illegal substance, or a perfectly normal one, or even
a type of roleplaying interaction (maybe the character has to try to
come as close to dying as he can).
Paranoid: The character trusts no one. He receives a +6 to the
bonus number when trying to resist bluﬀ attempts, but he also
receives this “bonus” when trying to be persuaded — and he
must be persuaded before he’ll help even his closest friends.
“Everyone is out to get him.”
Phobic: The character is deathly afraid of something.
It could be heights, open spaces, spiders, or another person
(such as an authority ﬁgure or one with whom he has frightening
memories). Unless the character makes his mettle roll (below), he
dissolves into terror.
Vengeful: The character cannot stand to “lose” or be “wronged.”
If the character perceives himself as looking foolish (or whatever),
she will go to great lengths to get even (in reality, the character probably takes it too far).
Restrictions/Notes: The character has a Very Diﬃcult Charisma
or mettle roll to make to overcome the Quirk — at the least. If, in
the gamemaster’s judgment, there is a reason the character should
have modiﬁers to the diﬃculty, then he will. Players who don’t want
to play a character who can frequently lose control should avoid this
option. Other rules are the same as under Quirk (R1)

Reduced Attribute (R2 or more)
Something about the character’s species, age, physical condition, or
some other factor has permanently reduced one attribute by one pip
per rank. The character may not reduce the attribute die code below
1D, and the attribute die code may never be increased by spending
Character Points (though gaining a Special Ability would help).
Restrictions/Notes: With the exception of permanently restricting access to an Extranormal attribute, a player may not give a character
this Disadvantage at character creation.

• Page 27

Only one rank may be taken with an Extranormal attribute of 0D,
and the character’s species must be required to take at least 1D in
the aﬀected attribute. Characters who have this Disadvantage on an
Extranormal attribute before having any die code in that attribute
may never take that Extranormal attribute.
The reduction in die code increases by one pip for each additional
rank taken in this Disadvantage. (Remember that three pips equal
one die.) The character may have diﬀerent variations on this Disadvantage for each attribute, including Extranormal attributes, such as
Magic or Miracles.

Advantages
Authority (R1)
The character has some measure of power over other people in
his region. The scope of the character’s rank, duties, and power in his
local jurisdiction dictate the rank in this Advantage. An Authority (R1)
Advantage might belong to someone who, because of circumstance,
does not have a lot of opportunity to use his authority or someone
who is very low in rank.
Law Enforcement is one version of this Advantage that gives adventurers some measure of abilities associated with being a deputized
agent of the law. Authority: Law Enforcement (R1) means the character
can carry a weapon and has limited authority to enforce the
law. Mercenaries, bounty hunters, and bail bondsmen might
need this Advantage in certain settings.
Restrictions/Notes: It is not necessary to have the
Authority: Law Enforcement Advantage to own a weapon
in those regions that allow ordinary citizens to own them.
However, if owning a weapon is illegal in a country and limited
to deputized oﬃcials, then this version of the Advantage would
be necessary.
Remember, too, that outside of the character’s jurisdiction or
permit limits, this Advantage may have little or no value.

Authority (R2)
Same as Authority (R1), but the character has more inﬂuence,
possibly commanding a small number of troops or being in charge
of a small company or town. With Authority: Law Enforcement (R2),
the character is actually part of the city watch or royal guard and is
allowed to make full arrests and search and seizures.
Restrictions/Notes: See Authority (R1) for more information.

Authority (R3)
Same as Authority (R1), except that the character has a great deal
of power and inﬂuence. The head of a large guild or someone whose
authority is simply never questioned would have this Advantage.
With Authority: Law Enforcement (R3), the character
could be a high-ranking oﬃcer in the watch or army,
having authority over those with Rank 2 of this
Advantage.
Restrictions/Notes: Higher levels of Authority
indicate a wider sphere of inﬂuence, such as a large
region, an alliance of kingdoms, or an empire. Otherwise, see Authority (R1) for more information.

Chapter 2

Contacts (R1)
The character “knows somebody” or a group of somebodies who
will generally help out the character if he makes a decent appeal or
suﬃciently compensates the contact. This level of contact only sticks
around for a limited amount of time (part of an adventure or maybe
throughout a short adventure).
The character might know a “group” with a wider range of inﬂuence (but less power) that will help out, again, for a modest fee or
under the right circumstances. The inﬂuence might not be as direct,
but it is easier to come by. For instance, there might be a widespread
religious group that will provide food or shelter for a small donation
(much lower than getting such things at an inn). They won’t do much
about that a raging giant chasing you, but they can be of immense
help under the right circumstances.
Restrictions/Notes: Contacts should not automatically help
the character, but they should be reasonable in their negotiations.
Multiple contacts of various ranks may be selected and they may be
stacked. For instance, a certain person might be a Contact (R1) in
most circumstances, but he could be a Contact (R2) or even a Contact
(R3) in the right place — such as a mercenary who might help out for
a fee versus normal foes, but when ﬁghting his “hereditary enemies,”
he might be almost invincible and eager to help.
Remember that contacts are gamemaster’s characters. They should
be created and played rationally. If a player refuses to roleplay or
takes advantage of contacts, he should be penalized when trying to
use them (and possibly lose them). There should also be a reason in
the character’s story why he has these contacts.

Contacts, Patrons, Enemies
In fantasy settings, family and employment often exist
as important aspects of a character’s life. Contacts, Patrons,
and Enemies can represent not only people the character
knows, but also people that the character is related to by
blood, marriage, apprenticeship, or fostering.
Furthermore, having friends in high places often means
the character attracts the attention of the friends’ friends
... and enemies. Players willing to roleplay long, associative
networks may add lower-level Contacts in exchange for an
equivalent number of Ranks in one or more Enemies. The
player must purchase one Contact or Patron of Rank 2 or
greater. All additional Contacts and Enemies must have an
association with that primary Contact or Patron. As long as
the total number of Ranks in the additional Contacts equals
the total number of Ranks in the Enemies, the Enemies do
not count toward the Disadvantage maximum.
Example: A player decides to have a Rank 3 Patron. The
player may then add any number of Rank 1 or 2 Contacts as
long as she adds an equal number of Enemies. If she chose to
add three Rank 1 Contacts (well-placed personal assistants to
the Patron), the player would have to think of three Rank 1
Enemies, or one Rank 1 and one Rank 2 Enemy, or one Rank
3 Enemy that this Patron has.

• Page 28

Contacts (R2)
This Advantage is identical to Contacts (R1), except the contact
is more powerful, more inﬂuential, easier to get hold of, willing to
do more favors, or aﬀects the game on a larger scale.
If the contact is supposed to be a large group, it now has much
greater inﬂuence over a wider area. For instance, instead of having
the religious group as a contact, the character might be able to call
on occasionally the aid of servants of the lord of a region.
Restrictions/Notes: Under no circumstances should any contact,
regardless of rank number, make roleplaying and thinking superﬂuous. Contacts are totally under the control of the gamemaster. Even
powerful and inﬂuential contacts from this rank should be kept under
a tight rein. See Contacts (R1) for more information.

Contacts (R3)
The contact or contacts chosen should be nearly supernormal,
supernatural, or uncanny in origin. For instance, a character’s Contact
(R3) might be a “thieves’ guild” with cells in every city — and the
members can turn up at the oddest moments.
Work with the gamemaster to come up with some interesting
contacts. It might be a group of highly spiritual monks who can be
called upon for “mystical aid” — or maybe a really complete occult
library.
Restrictions/Notes: Again, as with Contacts (R1) and (R2),
don’t let the contacts take over the game — and don’t let the player’s
character abuse them. Contacts are gamemaster controlled, but they
will usually only be brought into play at the character’s request.

Contacts (R4)
There is some sort of strange “force” that “watches over” and
occasionally helps the character. In many ways, this Advantage is
not as useful in most adventure situations as the other versions of
Contacts, but it can have dramatic eﬀects on occasion.
Some examples of this include a particularly powerful gamemaster
character who steps in occasionally to help the character when he’s
in trouble. Or, a widespread secret society might, for some reason,
want to step in and aid the character at times.
Generally, the character can get minor assistance — as could be
gotten from Contacts (R1) or Contacts (R2) — on a fairly regular
basis — and under the same sort of circumstances as having lower
versions of Contacts — but “the big stuﬀ” only happens when the
gamemaster thinks it appropriate. The character might get killed
before the Contacts (R4) intervenes — maybe the character just
wasn’t doing something the contact felt was important to it — but,
most likely, assistance will be provided.
Restrictions/Notes: Players’ characters should take this option
only if they want to take Disadvantages relating to it. For example,
if a character wants to have a group of wizards who like him and
will supply him with substantial aid on a regular basis (like a knight
who’s outﬁtted with new weapons and armor at the beginning of
every adventure and who can call for more during certain times in
the adventure), then he should take Disadvantages that relate to
that. The character could be a member of an organization (see the
Disadvantage Employed), or he must do reciprocating favors for the
wizards (see the Disadvantage Price), or there are equally powerful

Character Options

• Page 29

people who want to eliminate him because of his contacts (see the
Disadvantage Enemy).
If the character does not want to take extensive Disadvantages
relating to the contact, then Contacts (R4) should be unpredictable
and not always useful. For example, the wizards might provide the
character with plenty of magical equipment, but it might not always be
what the character needs or might not work correctly all of the time.

Cultures (R1)
This is another Advantage that can be utilized in more than one
way. The ﬁrst way is the simplest. The character has knowledge of
a particular (usually unusual) culture that he can use to his beneﬁt
when among people of that culture. This gives a bonus (usually +1)
to interactions in that culture and uses of the cultures skill to recall
details of the society.
Example: A character might have Cultures (R1) pertaining to a
certain type of intelligent monster. When the character goes on an
adventure in monsters’ territory, chances are good he will get help
from those monsters in his activities instead of being attacked as a
stranger or trespasser and ending up with his head in the stew.
Restrictions/Notes: A character with Cultures (R1) has about the
level of knowledge of a frequent tourist — no more. Unless the character has skills like streetwise, speaking, and other supporting skills,
he acts as if he has visited the culture and learned a decent amount
about their ways, but he is deﬁnitely an outsider. This Advantage
may be taken more than once for diﬀerent cultures.
The character’s background must reﬂect the “special insight” he
has into the culture or cultural trends.

Cultures (R2)
This option can be used pretty much like Cultures (R1), only on a
larger scale. Instead of choosing a small, unusual culture, the character
might choose an “alien” culture (one totally diﬀerent from his own)
and gain an understanding of it comparable to the understanding in
Cultures (R1). Or, he could choose to learn more about a relatively
small cultural group (to the point where the character would be
accepted as one who has spent a lot of time with the people).
Restrictions/Notes: The same as for Cultures (R1), but the character has about the level of knowledge of an outsider who has lived
in the culture for a while. Either that, or he would get more useful
information on alien cultures or “sweeping” cultural examinations.

Cultures (R3)
The character is either a native of an unusual culture or has the
knowledge and the respect as if she were one. A person who has
lived a signiﬁcant portion of her life in a culture and has that sort of
understanding of it would have Cultures (R3) — only the character is
actually a part of the game setting’s dominant culture as well.
If an alien culture can be, and is, selected, then the character has
an extreme familiarity with it.
Restrictions/Notes: As with Cultures (R1) and (R2), the character must choose what sort of cultural familiarity to have. Also,
there must be a compelling reason the character has this familiarity
or understanding. Finally, if the character chooses to be a “native”

of a particular culture, she should probably have to learn speaking:
(the culture’s major language) at least +1D.

Cultures (R4)
This selection should be taken only if the game setting employs
the use of alien cultures (those not totally understood by the dominant culture). The character understands the alien culture and can
interact within it — he is still an alien to it, but he is treated better
than any other outsider (most likely).
Example: In a game setting where non-Human races are rare,
the character is a Human from a village that’s on the edge of nonHuman races’ territory. She can thus interact with certain types
of aliens and can understand their ways. This doesn’t mean she’s
friends with them, but she has a better chance of interacting with
them, ﬁguring them out, and outsmarting their “inhuman logic”
than other characters.
Restrictions/Notes: The character should have related Disadvantages, and there has to be some extensive background description
telling why the character has this Advantage. Otherwise, see the other
entries regarding Cultures.

Equipment (R1)
The character gains a piece of equipment he would not normally
have because it is too expensive or “unavailable,” but only if it is
allowable under the game setting. For instance, a character could
start the game with leather armor but not chain mail — the latter
is generally too expensive for the average adventurer.

Chapter 2

Special Equipment
Gamemasters who want a stricter way of giving characters
special equipment can use this rule: Characters with the
Equipment Advantage may create one or more items with
the Special Abilities rules for a total number of points equal
to 2 times the rank in Equipment.
Example: A character with Equipment (R4) has eight
points with which to purchase Special Abilities, including
Enhancements and Limitations.
All items designed under this rule must have the SuperScience Limitation or the combination of the Magically
Empowered (any rank) Enhancement plus Burn-out (R1), may
be lost or stolen, Limitation. The Equipment Advantage may
have the Burn-out Disadvantage also as long as it’s diﬀerent
than “may be lost or stolen.”

Alternatively, the character could take lots of little pieces of equipment instead — more than what the gamemaster would normally allow.
Basically, equipment totaling in cost not more than about a few gold
pieces (or a price diﬃculty of Moderate) would ﬁt in this category.
Restrictions/Notes: Typically, as long as the character is not
careless with it, Equipment taken with any rank of this Advantage
is replaceable, unless the Burn-out Disadvantage is included with it.
Equipment (R1) may be selected more than once or in combination
with higher ranks of the Equipment Advantage with gamemaster
approval.

Equipment (R2)
The character gains a piece of equipment that would be very hard to
get because of expense or availability. Standard military weapons that
are usually out of reach of the normal citizen are available. In addition,
equipment totaling in cost not more than a dozen gold pieces (or a
price diﬃculty of Diﬃcult) would probably be okay. In game settings
that have magical or super-science equipment, objects of fairly low
power would probably be obtained using this Advantage.
Restrictions/Notes: See Equipment (R1) for more information.
Equipment (R2) may be selected more than once or in combination
with higher ranks of the Equipment Advantage with gamemaster
approval.

Equipment (R3)
Items of equipment that are normally unavailable to just about
anyone can be picked up using this Advantage. Any one item on any
equipment chart can be selected, or the gamemaster can make up a
“special” item that has unusual eﬀects or Special Abilities. Alternatively, they can just be really expensive or virtually unavailable items.
Equipment totaling a few handfuls of gold (or a price diﬃculty of
Very Diﬃcult) falls under this category.
Restrictions/Notes: The gamemaster should watch this Advantage carefully. It can only be selected once at character creation
— though the Rank 1 and Rank 2 versions can also be selected
— but it can still unbalance a beginning character. Generally, things

• Page 30

that can be taken away fairly easily — like magic wands and swords,
strange technology, low-powered miraculous artifacts, and other
related equipment — would be suitably appropriate for characters
with minimal experience.

Equipment (R4)
Really bizarre and, most likely, powerful equipment is open to the
character — but only one such piece or a collection of small, related
pieces. No one else can use the equipment without making some
sort of exhaustive skill total, and it can probably not be repaired
or duplicated. Equipment with Special Abilities or atypical game
characteristics ﬁts into this category.
The equipment could be a weapon more powerful than most
personal weapons in the game setting. Or it could be a magical spell
that could not normally be used by the character or anyone else in
the world at its relatively low diﬃculty. Or it could be a collection of
gadgets and gizmos that can perform many diﬀerent mundane tasks
— but how, nobody knows.
Restrictions/Notes: The character should have Disadvantages
related to the equipment. Maybe Enemies want to steal it, or it has
an Advantage Flaw so it doesn’t work all the time — or the same way
every time. In addition, the equipment should not make the character
so powerful that opponents fall before him. In game mechanic terms,
the equipment should be just slightly more powerful or more useful
than what is available normally. The more powerful the item, the
more Disadvantages and restrictions should be related to it.
Example: A player might choose to give his character an average
bow and increase the damage score by two points. As this is a small
increase, the gamemaster permits the bow to never need reloading.
Instead, the arrows appear magically, cocked and ready.

Fame (R1)
The character, for some reason, is fairly well known. The character
has a dense penetration of recognition, but with little wide-sweeping
eﬀects (for instance, everyone in town knows who they are, but no one
from more than a few days’ travel away has ever heard of them).
Whenever the gamemaster or the player thinks the character
might be recognized (and the Fame Advantage would come into
play), the gamemaster should roll 3D. If the result is 15 or higher, the
character is recognized. Otherwise, he has to do something “special”
to be recognized (and gain the beneﬁts of recognition).
If a character with Fame (R1) is recognized, he should gain small
perks, like getting immediate service in a tavern, avoiding small legal
hassles (like routine wagon checks when entering a city), or just be
treated generally better (perhaps the character gets a couple of bonus
points to persuasion, bluﬀ, and charm attempts). Like most roleplayed
Advantages, the gamemaster should decide on the results.
Restrictions/Notes: Fame may be chosen multiple times as long as
the player deﬁnes how each Fame is diﬀerent. For example, a character
might have Fame (R1) in regards to his ﬁghting abilities, but another
type of Fame pertaining to his intelligence or some other ability.

Fame (R2)
The character is very well known. The character would probably
be recognized in most fairly civilized cultures and almost deﬁnitely

Character Options
in her home culture. The gamemaster should roll 3D and, on a 15
or higher, a person from another culture recognizes the person and
react (usually favorably). In the character’s own culture, this reaction
comes on an 8 or more. If the character draws attention to herself
in her own culture (identiﬁes herself), then the reaction will most
likely be automatic (gamemaster’s option).
Restrictions/Notes: At this level of Fame, the character should
be treated like a well-known bard or popular ﬁghter. Some gamemaster’s characters will be immune to this Fame, but most will have
some sort of (generally positive) reaction. Otherwise, see Fame (R1)
for more information.

Fame (R3)
There is a pretty good chance anyone in the game setting will
recognize the character (or what the character is) fairly easily. The
base die total needed is 8, and it can be modiﬁed by circumstance.
The character has the status of a high-ranking noble or religious
personage.
Restrictions/Notes: They are the same as for Fame (R1) and
Fame (R2) — certain people just won’t be impressed. In addition,
characters with Fame (R3) should almost always have to take at
least one rank in the Disadvantage Infamy — no matter how nice,
talented, or generally well-liked a person is, there’s always somebody
out there who wishes her harm.

Patron (R1)
The odds are that most players’ characters are not independently
wealthy. But they might have access to wealth in the form of patrons.

• Page 31

If the characters are treasure hunters, patrons might include minor
nobles, small ﬁefs, or even retired adventurers.
Patron (R1) means the character has a backer who will fund one
expedition, with all proceeds going to the patron. All of the costs
(room, board, travel, expenses) are covered by the patron, with the
understanding that the player’s character is basically just a workerfor-hire. Anything that the adventurer discovers or purchases becomes
the property of the patron.

Patron (R2)
A Patron (R2) expects much less from those he backs. The character
may receive less ﬁnancial support, but the adventurer has greater
freedom of action.
An expansionistic government is a common example of an organization qualifying for Patron (R2). They cover a character’s travel
expenses in exchange for news about new lands to conquer. Anything
that the character ﬁnds on his own (like artifacts) remain his own.

Patron (R3)
A Patron (R3) will give a character a limited stipend and cover most
expenses, then oﬀer to purchase whatever the character recovers.
Without consistent results, the funding will be cut oﬀ.

Size (R1 or more)
The character is much larger or smaller than the average Human.
For every rank in this Advantage, the player receives up to +3 to his
character’s scale modiﬁer (which starts at zero). The player must
specify whether the character is bigger or smaller than the average
Human.
Restrictions/Notes: Generally, the character’s weight is proportional for his height, but a Disadvantage, such as Hindrance: Reduced
Toughness, or a Special Ability, such as Hardiness, could be used to
represent a very thin or very large character (respectively). Likewise,
to reﬂect a longer stride, the character should have the Hypermovement Special Ability, while a shorter stride would get the Hindrance:
Shorter Stride Disadvantage. Obviously, no character may take the
Size: Large and the Size: Small Advantages.
For details on using scale, see page 71 in the “Combat Options”
chapter.

Trademark Specialization (R1)
This Advantage works a lot like a combination of the Skill Bonus
Special Ability and Fame. The character is remarkably good at one
very speciﬁc thing, and he is known for it. Choose any specialization
that the character has (or would like to have in the future), and the
character gains +2D to the roll when it is used. In addition, when the
character uses it, there is a gamemaster-option chance that people will
recognize how “naturally good” the character is at the specialization,
and this might produce interesting situations. Also, the character
might be contacted or recognized by certain people because of how
good he is at that one specialization.
Restrictions/Notes: This character acts as if trained in the
use of this skill. No character may have more than two Trademark
Specializations.

Chapter 2

Wealth (R1 or more)
The character with this Advantage probably has an estate or a series
of investments that will keep him comfortable for a good long time.
Alternatively, the character could be minor nobility or be married to
a minor noble. This doesn’t mean the character can buy everything
— he is still subject to the availability of items.
For each rank in this Advantage, the characters has 10 gold coins in
readily available cash once per month. The accounts never have more
than 10 gold coins times the number of ranks each month (fees and
living expenses keep it at that level), and the amount could be less
by the end of the month. Adventure bonuses could temporarily raise
the ﬁgure, though the character would have to purchase an additional
rank of Wealth to make the increase permanent. Players in games
using the Funds attribute gain +2 per rank to all such totals.
Restrictions/Notes: Characters should select only one rank of
Wealth, unless there is some reason they might have Wealth (R1)
and another rank of Wealth in other circumstances. Also, this wealth
does not always help and disappears if misused (and it should be
a major concern to the character at times), but it should be there
most of the time. Gamemasters will probably think of ways to work
around wealth and players should play along — if you can throw
money at every problem, then they aren’t that much fun to try to
solve, are they?
The most likely Disadvantage a character with Wealth would have
is Devotion, such as “helping all those in need” or “righting all wrong
doing.” Otherwise, there should be fairly extensive reasons why the
character can’t use his wealth to resolve every situation — or hire
somebody to do it for him (which is really the same thing).

Special Abilities
Before allowing players to create characters with Special Abilities,
the gamemaster may wish to peruse this list to see if there are any
she would prefer not to appear in her games. She may also decide
that certain Special Abilities require speciﬁc Limitations on them or
Disadvantages on the character.
Any Special Ability that gives a bonus to the die roll or the skill
total also allows the character to use that skill as if trained. Bonuses
received from taking multiple ranks of the same Special Ability are
added together.
Skills gained with a Special Ability are not improved when that Special Ability is improved. Instead, they are increased as a normal skill.
Unless stated otherwise in the Special Ability, it does not count
as an action for the character to get the bonus from a Special Ability. However, except for such automatic abilities as Natural Armor
or Combat Sense, the character must state that she is relying on the
Special Ability or she does not receive the bonus.

Accelerated Healing (3)
The character gains a +1D per rank to his Physique for all natural
healing attempts, and a Critical Failure is treated as 1, rather than
having a negative eﬀect on the die roll.

Ambidextrous (2)
The character is equally adept with her right or left hand. She may
perform an action with each hand in the same round, and, though

• Page 32

she takes the multi-action penalty, she receives a +1 per rank to each
skill total. The actions must involve the hands or similar manipulative appendage and each action must require only one limb. If the
character performs only one hand-related action in a round, she does
not get the bonus. Some skills that characters could employ with
either hand include ﬁghting, lockpicking, marksmanship, throwing,
lifting, artist, and the map-making aspect of navigation, though, of
course, not every task covered by each skill is relevant. A character
may take multiple ranks of this Special Ability for two pairs of hands
and multiple ranks for each additional manipulative limb.
Example: A player with a Reptilite character, who has a tail, wants
a +2 bonus when using two hands and the tail in the same round. The
player would buy Ambidextrous: Hands and Ambidextrous: Tail each
at Rank 2, since this Special Ability must be purchased separately
from the hands for each additional manipulative limb.

Animal Control (3)
This gives the character the ability to control one particular species
of animal, bird, or insect. The character gets a +10 bonus to her animal
handling total for that species. She must generate an animal handling
versus the Charisma or mettle of the animal (more than one animal
can be targeted, although this is a multi-action). If the character gets a
high enough success (gamemaster’s decision), the animal is controlled
for a number of minutes equal to the animal handling skill total times
10. A controlled animal serves its master faithfully, even sacriﬁcing
itself on her behalf. The Special Ability has a range of sight or voice.
The character may gain one more species for each rank.
Note: A swarm of insects counts as one animal, as does a school
of small ﬁsh. Almost any creature with a Intellect die code of less
than 2D could be considered an animal, unless the gamemaster says
otherwise (for example, a horse would be animal, but a
zombie with a Intellect of 1D would not).

Armor-Defeating
Attack (2)
When a character with
natural weapons (the
character’s fists, claws,
teeth, etc.) attacks someone protected by armor, this ability negates the Armor Value, up to
+1D per rank. The character must specify how the attack negates the
armor: An acidic mist slips through any openings, enchanted claws
reach directly to the ﬂesh, and the like. There should be at least one
type of armor that is unaﬀected by this.

Atmospheric Tolerance (2)
The character can breathe one form of atmosphere (such as dusty
air, frigid air, or extreme altitudes) that would be lethal to most other
characters. A character may not have more than one rank in this ability,
but he may have diﬀerent versions for diﬀerent atmospheres.

Attack Resistance (2)
The character is highly resistant to a certain type of attack. She
gains +1D per rank to her damage resistance roll against this type
of attack.

Character Options
Energy Attacks: Resistant to blasts of severe heat, ﬁre, electricity, light, intense cold, and so on, but not the ability to survive in
extremes of such environments.
Extranormal Attack: Resistant to damage from any Extranormalbased (such as Magic or Miracles) attack.
Mental Attacks: Resistant to mental harm from any source. It
does not provide protection against interaction attempts.
Nonenchanted Weapons: Resistant to physical damage from
nonenchanted weapons, but not from poisons, energy, or similar
materials.

Attribute Scramble (4)
The character can adjust an opponent’s (or a friend’s) attributes
temporarily. She gains the scramble skill at +1 per rank in a single
version of this Special Ability (it is an Acumen skill, described only
here), which she also can increase as a normal skill. The scrambler
must pick as her focus either physical or mental attributes, though
never Extranormal, Funds, or Special Abilities. (Physical attributes
encompass Agility, Coordination, and Physique. Mental attributes
include Intellect, Acumen, and Charisma.) She only may do both by
taking this Special Ability once for each version.
When she goes after a target with a ﬁghting roll, she may choose
(as a multi-action) to also perform a scramble attack versus her
target’s mettle or Charisma. (This is not an action for the target.) No
close combat attack is necessary for a willing target, but the act of
scrambling still counts as an action. If her total is higher (not equal
to), she may shift her target’s attribute points around, within certain
limits. The close combat attack does no damage.
She may increase one or more related attributes by a number
equal to the amount she takes away from other related attributes
— but she may not decrease or increase any one attribute by more
than 2D (6 pips).
The change lasts for a number of rounds equal to the diﬀerence
between the scramble attack and the target’s mettle or Charisma. A
character who has been adjusted cannot be scrambled again until
the original adjustment wears oﬀ.

Blur (3)
The character can appear indistinct to the naked eye or nonenchanted visual aids (spyglasses, mirrors, etc.). Commonly, a
character with this Special Ability will only be spotted out of the
corner of the eye. This adds 1 to the character’s dodge, stealth, and
hide totals, as well as +1 to all default search, tracking, investigation, and attack diﬃculties against the character that the blurring
character is not actively trying to defeat. (These modiﬁers are
per rank in this Special Ability.) On the character’s turn, she
may automatically become blurry, without taking an action, and
remain so until she chooses otherwise. Blurring also makes it
diﬃcult for the character to hold a conversation with others.

Combat Sense (3)
The character can sense danger. She is never surprised. Rather,
she and her attacker must determine initiative as normal. Even
if the attacker still goes before the character does, any combat
modiﬁer from the surprise is reduced by 2. A character may not
have this ability more than once.

• Page 33

Confusion (4)
The character can hamper the thoughts of those he comes into
physical contact with, at will. He gains the confuse skill at +1 per rank
(it is a Charisma skill, described only here), which he can increase
as normal.
As a multi-action with a ﬁghting attack, he may also perform a
confusion attack versus his target’s mettle or Charisma. (This is not an
action for the target.) If his total is higher (not equal to), the target is
confused. Characters may not play cards (if the gamemaster is using
game-enhancing cards with the adventures) or spend points, and they
receive a +5 diﬃculty modiﬁer to even simple actions for a number
of rounds equal to 2 times the rank of this Special Ability.

Darkness (3)
The character can project a ﬁeld of darkness around himself, adding
+5 per rank to the diﬃculty of any sight-based skill totals. The ﬁeld
extends in a half-sphere around the character with a radius equal to
one meter per rank. The ﬁeld can be maintained for a maximum of
one minute per rank before dispersing.

Elasticity (1)
The character can stretch, elongate, and compress his body,
allowing him to expand his height or become so narrow he can pass
through keyholes, cracks, or any other opening he could normally see
through. It takes one round or more to slip through small openings,
depending on their depth. The character gains +1 per rank to contortion, dodge, or sleight of hand totals, in addition to disguise attempts
he performs on himself.

Endurance (1)
The character has great endurance, and gains a +3D per rank to
Physique or stamina checks when performing taxing physical tasks
(such as holding one’s breath underwater for a long period or running a long distance).

Chapter 2

• Page 34

Extra Sense (1)
The character can detect something that a normal Human cannot,
such as changes in pressure, seismic activity, radiation ﬂuctuations,
and so on. She gains a +1D to her search rolls in attempting to detect
the speciﬁc energy or environmental change and +1D to her investigation rolls in ﬁguring out source or other relevant information. The
gamemaster may also allow a +1 skill total bonus to other activities
that would beneﬁt from whatever the extra sense can detect. All
modiﬁers are per rank in this Special Ability.

Fast Reactions (3)
The character gains +1D per rank to his Acumen when determining initiative, and, up to three times during the adventure, he may
receive one additional action for one round.

Fear (2)
The character can provoke fear in those who can see or hear him.
He gains a +1 per rank to all his intimidation totals and his target has
a +1 increase to combat defense diﬃculties against the horrifying
being. Inspiring fear requires an action, but it is the target that rolls
her mettle or Charisma (which does not count as an action for her)
against a diﬃculty of 15 to negate the eﬀects.

Flight (6)
Enhanced Sense (3)
One of the character’s ﬁve senses is heightened to abnormal
levels. The bonus to the skill total received depends on the sense:
sight is +1; hearing is +2; touch, taste, and smell are +3. The bonus
is per rank and applies to all skills (including combat ones) related
to the sense. Enhanced hearing also may aﬀect initiative rolls. To
have multiple enhanced senses, this Special Ability must be taken
at least once for each sense.

Environmental Resistance (1)
The character is resistant to extremes of heat, cold, and pressure,
and he gains a +3D per rank to Physique or stamina checks to resist
ill eﬀects from these environmental conditions. The character is not
resistant to heat or cold attacks, as these come and go too quickly
for the Special Ability to provide protection.

Extra Body Part (0)
The character has an extra limb or organ. If external, these may be
secondary arms or legs, a tail, or some more exotic bodily addition,
such as ﬁns, tentacles, or antennae. If internal, the parts are organs
such as extra eyes, hearts, or mysterious glands. Unless speciﬁed
by a Disadvantage or Limitation, the extra parts are included in the
character’s body tastefully. Additionally, except in cases where the
character has an Enhancement or another Special Ability that uses
this one (for example, Extra Body Part: Tail and Natural Hand-toHand Weapon: Tail), the extra part is nonfunctional. A character may
have only one rank in this Special Ability, but she may have multiple
versions to represent multiple additional organs or limbs.

The character can ﬂy, either by nature or by virtue of having
wings. The character’s ﬂying rate equals his base Move (including
Hypermovement, if applicable) times 2 times the number of ranks.
The ﬂying skill is required to maneuver.

Glider Wings (3)
The character can ﬂy by drifting with air currents. The gamemaster decides how much wind there is available and how fast it
moves the glider. Characters with this Special Ability need the ﬂying
skill to control their passage. A character may not have this ability
more than once.

Hardiness (1)
The character can take damage better than normal. She adds 1 per
rank to her damage resistance total against any type of damage.

Hypermovement (1)
The character is extremely fast, adding +2 meters per round per
rank to her base Move rate, which in turn aﬀects all other types of
movement.

Immortality (7)
The character is immortal, though she will grow older, at a decreased
pace compared to the rest of her species. If she is reduced to zero
Body Points or loses all her Wounds, she doesn’t die. Instead, one
of two situations occurs: she continues to live, though minimally, in
this world, or she returns to her home dimension. She does not go
unconscious or bleed to death (as mortally wounded characters do),
nor can she heal without magical or miraculous aid or the Accelerated
Healing Special Ability — her arms could be lopped oﬀ, her abdomen

eviscerated, or whatever. She may perform only the most minimal
of physical actions, such as squirming, and some actions may be
impossible. She may rely on her Agility for initiative purposes only
(if her Acumen total does not apply for some reason).
There should be one particular set of circumstances whereby the
character will die forever. These sets of circumstances should not be
too unusual — killed directly by magic, drowning, decapitation, and
so on are all good examples.
A character may not have this ability more than once.

unless the gamemaster feels there is suﬃcient provocation, such as
brushing against others or removing something in a crowded area.
The invisibility covers the character’s basic clothes only and a few
small items in pockets or pouches attached to the clothes — not any
gear she’s carrying, or anything she picks up. Also, remember that
the character is transparent when invisible — she can’t hide things
behind her back.

Immunity (1)

The character is highly resistant to all interaction attempts and
mental attacks. He gains a +1D per rank to all mettle rolls and +2 to
the standard diﬃculty of any such attempts against this character.

The character is highly resistant to disease and poisons and
receives a +1D per rank to Physique or stamina checks when determining whether he has contracted an illness or is suﬀering from
ingested poisons.

Increased Attribute (2)
Some strange ability (or physiological trait) allows the character
to gain +1 bonus per rank to all rolled totals related to that attribute. (For Physique, this also includes the damage resistance total
and Strength Damage.) A character may have multiple ranks of this
Special Ability, as well as multiple versions of it.
Note: To get another rank in this Special Ability after character
creation costs 4 times the number in front of the “D” of the attribute
that it aﬀects plus the number of ranks currently in the Special Ability.
(This is instead of the normal cost to increase Special Abilities.)

Infravision/Ultravision (1)
The character gains the ability to either see in the dark using infravision or ultravision. Infravision allows the character to see changes
in heat, while ultravision enables the character to make the most of
the available light. Each provides a +2 per rank in a single version
of this Special Ability to sight-based totals (including attacks) while
in dim or dark conditions. Obviously, extreme heat or bright light
(including daylight) prevent this Special Ability from working.

Intangibility (5)
The character can reduce his physical density to virtually zero for
one minute per rank. During that time, his damage resistance score
against physical and energy (such as ﬁre) attacks is +3D per rank, but
his movement rate is halved. An intangible character can pass through
solid objects, providing they do not contain wards or other spells of
protection designed to repel passage of this nature. He may not pass
through ﬁery or energy barriers. While intangible, the character cannot
carry any object along (including clothing), nor can he attempt any
physical attack. It takes a full round for a character to become intangible
or solid, during which he can do nothing else. The character must spend
at least one minute solid before attempting intangibility again.

Invisibility (3)
The character can become transparent. This adds 1 per rank to the
character’s dodge, stealth, and hide totals, as well as +1 per rank to all
default search, tracking, investigation, and attack diﬃculties against the
character that the invisible character is not actively trying to defeat.
Additionally, no character may take an action to “spot” the character

Iron Will (2)

Life Drain (5)
This ability allows the character to drain attribute pips, Body
Points, or Wound levels from his target.
The character must choose one set of attributes to target, either
physical (Agility, Coordination, Physique), mental (Intellect, Acumen,
Charisma), Wounds, or Body Points. For example, most vampires drink
blood, and thus lower Body Points, while succubi target the soul and
so weaken mental attributes. The player must specify in what manner the character drains these attributes (biting the neck, hypnosis,
or another means). It should involve some sort of successful attack
result (either physical or mental).
When the character wishes to employ Life Drain, he makes an
attack on his target using the relevant skill. For every four points
over the target’s defense roll, the character drains one pip per rank
oﬀ each of the target’s relevant attributes or three points per rank
from the character’s Body Points or one Wound for every two ranks.
(Remember that there are three pips in each die.)
If any of the target’s attributes or Body Points ever go to zero (or
the character reaches the Dead Wound level), the target goes into a
coma. She may try once per day to wake up by making a successful
Moderate stamina or Physique roll. She regains one attribute point
(to each attribute aﬀected) every hour after the attack. Body Points
and Wound levels return at the normal rate.
For each attribute pip the character drains, he may add one pip to
any attribute in his chosen category. He would get one Body Point for
each Body Point drained or one Wound for each Wound drained.
Life-Drained attributes and unused Body Points or Wounds disappear at a rate of one pip or point per hour.
A character may have multiple ranks of this Special Ability, as well
as multiple versions of it.

Longevity (3)
The character lives longer than the average Human. Often, this
Special Ability has a Flaw attached that governs what the character
must do to maintain his life. The character should gain peripheral
bonuses during game play because of his “longer outlook.” A character
may not have this ability more than once.

Luck, Good (2)
The character is blessed with unusually good luck. Once per adventure, a character with Good Luck can receive one of the following
beneﬁts just by asking for it: action, breakthrough, haste, or second

Chapter 2

• Page 36

Luck Benefits
action: Add 2 to all of the character’s skill or attribute totals for the round.
alertness: When the character calls upon this beneﬁt, he gains a special “sixth sense” outside of all other rules and roleplaying
situations that will help him to spot a previously unseen item, character, or clue selected by the gamemaster. The beneﬁt does not
confer omniscience, however — and the gamemaster can select her own time for having it come into eﬀect. It is normally used to allow
a character to spot something he missed in a previous search, something that is important to the adventure.
breakthrough: Add 1D to any one skill die code in which the character has no additional pips or dice (in other words, a skill in
which the character is untrained). The beneﬁt also eliminates the unskilled modiﬁer for using that skill.
haste: Gain one additional action for one round.
hero: Receive one bonus Fate Point, which the character must use on an action immediately after requesting it.
opponent fails: After an opponent or enemy has completed an action against the character, the character may call upon this beneﬁt
to cancel the eﬀects entirely. This nulliﬁes the opponent’s action, and play continues. The lucky character may not use this beneﬁt to
cancel an action that is not directed at least partially at him.
second chance: Using this beneﬁt allows the character to attempt any action she has just tried again, from the very beginning.
This beneﬁt cannot negate “bad choices” — the character must perform the action performed again — nor does it allow the character
to “get back” Fate Points, Character Points, or cards (if used) spent on the original action. The character merely gets another chance,
immediately following the ﬁrst attempt, to perform the action again. All eﬀects from the ﬁrst attempt are ignored.

Luck Notes
A character may have up to two ranks each in Good Luck and Great Luck. This Special Ability can be taken with the Bad Luck Disadvantage — sometimes really good things happen, sometimes really bad things happen.

chance. See the “Luck Beneﬁts” sidebar for details on each of these
options. Calling upon one’s luck does not count as an action.
Good Luck can only be declared once per rank during a particular adventure, but it may be declared at any time, and it cannot be
cancelled by any other eﬀect. A character may have up to two ranks
of this Special Ability.

The gamemaster might choose to have the character be really lucky
— the villain was bluﬃng or has decided to take time to gloat. In
any case, the character’s Great Luck is gone for this adventure (his
luck ran out), but he has a chance of averting disaster.

Luck, Great (3)

The character has a natural talent for disguise. She gains a +5
bonus per rank to disguise totals for altering her own appearance and
demeanor, +2 when changing someone else’s looks, and a +1D bonus
per rank to any Charisma-based actions while in that disguise.

A character with Great Luck can call on one of the following
beneﬁts once per adventure per rank: action, alertness, breakthrough,
haste, hero, opponent fails, or second chance. See the “Luck Beneﬁts”
sidebar for details on each of these options. Calling upon one’s luck
does not count as an action.
If the character has not used his Great Luck during an adventure
and something really disastrous happens, the gamemaster may choose
to counteract the eﬀects and temporarily “burn out” the character’s
Special Ability — that is, the character’s Great Luck has been used
up for the adventure. Usually, this is used when the character does
something stupid or the player is the victim of incredibly bad luck
— die rolling, not the Disadvantage — and something “stops” the
eﬀect. This is a “last ditch,” gamemaster-controlled eﬀort when
circumstances get out of control. It is also a nice thing for inexperienced roleplayers to have — just in case they do something they
really shouldn’t have, they get another chance.
Example: The character’s mission is to stop a wizard from
destroying a nearby city. Unfortunately, the character takes too long
ﬁghting the minions of the dastardly wizard, and, according to the
rules, the whole city should go up in ﬂames. The character is too late.

Master of Disguise (3)

Multiple Abilities (1)
The character has multiple minor abilities that improve a few different tasks. All bonuses are added to the skill or attribute total, not
to the die code. The bonuses should be fairly limited in their applications, pertaining to speciﬁc uses of particular skills (like specializations
do), but there can be several of them for each selection of this Special
Ability. The maximum total bonus for each rank is +4.
Example: A character could have “eyestalks” that give him a +1
bonus to Acumen or search to negate surprise, the ability to focus
his ears on particular types of noises (+1 bonus when listening for
particular sounds), and a nose that is sensitive to certain scents (+1
bonus to tracking when attempting to ﬁnd small animals).

Natural Armor (3)
The character has plates, toughened skin, scales, or something
similar. His own surface adds 1D per rank to his damage resistance

Character Options
roll to nonmagical physical (not mental) attacks and contact poisons,
corrosives, or similar materials.

Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon (2)
The character has some sort of natural weapon —such as claws,
pincers, bone sword, or stinger — that adds 1D per rank to his
Strength Damage when determining his damage with the natural
weapon. The character uses ﬁghting to attack, unless the weapon is
something that detaches from him or (in the case of a super-scientiﬁc
or magical weapon) exists separately. In this latter case, the character
employs melee combat to wield it.

Natural Magick (5 or more)
The character can use a magic spell as a natural ability. An example
of this would be a character who can dispel magic by his nature, rather
than through the use of a countermagic spell. The cost of the ability
— and the number of ranks the character has in it — equals the difﬁculty of the spell. (See the “Magic” chapter for details on creating
spells; the “Precalculated Spells” chapter has some sample spells.)
The chosen spell may not be charged (that is, have a ﬁxed limit to
the number of times it can be cast).
The character must adhere to the requirements of the spell, including its gestures, incantations, components, and so on. The casting of
the spell is automatic (there is no need to roll a Magic skill to perform
it), but the character does need to attempt any targeting skill or skill
required by the casting (such as one needed to perform a gesture). If
any of these fail, the spell does not work.
The player and the gamemaster need to discuss what spell the
character will have, and what the range, duration, and so on will
be. It’s suggested that some limitations be placed on the use of this
ability to maintain game balance — for instance, a character who can
toss ﬁreballs as a natural ability might have to recharge for a certain
number of rounds before doing so again.
A character may have this Special Ability once each for diﬀerent
spells.

Natural Ranged Weapon (3)
The character has some sort of natural ranged weapon,
using marksmanship to target it. Long range equals 20
times the number of ranks in this Special Ability times the
character’s Physique or lifting (as appropriate) in meters.
The damage for physically enhanced projections is the
character’s Strength Damage plus 1D per rank, while the
damage for all other types of blasts is 3D per rank. The
projection must have a visible eﬀect (such as a bone spikes
or a sparkling beam) and it may not do mental damage.
Note that, regardless of the nature of the projection, there
are no additional eﬀects from this type of Special Ability
unless an Enhancement allows otherwise.

Omnivorous (2)
The character can gain nourishment from any organic
substance (though she is not immune to poisons). She
can also chew through just about any organic substance
with no adverse eﬀects to her teeth or jaws. A character
may not have this ability more than once.

• Page 37

Paralyzing Touch (4)
The character can freeze her target with the merest touch.
When she makes a ﬁghting attack, she may, instead of doing
damage, paralyze her victim, who remains that way until he makes
a successful Charisma or mettle roll against the ﬁghting skill total. He
may attempt to do so once per round; the only other actions he may
take are mental-based ones and Extranormal or Special Ability ones
that do not require movement.
Note: Characters who are heavily armored or covered will be
harder to hit. The gamemaster needs to decide how much skin is
exposed and adjust the attack diﬃculty accordingly.
A character may not have this ability more than once.

Possession, Limited (8)
The character can possess the body of a living creature or a corpse.
The character must be within three times the rank of this Special
Ability in meters of the target in order to possess it.
Possessing a corpse doesn’t require a roll, but it does take an
action. Possessing a living being involves making a Charisma or mettle
check by the possessor versus a standard interaction diﬃculty (see
the “Mental Defenses” section on page 73 for details). Exceeding (but
not equalling) the diﬃculty means the target has been possessed. The
target can actively defend if she is aware of the potential danger.
To gather knowledge about his host body’s life, the possessing
character must generate a successful investigation total against the
target’s Intellect roll (this does not count as an action for the target).
Information the possessor gains depends upon the level of success
achieved; see the accompanying chart for details.
With Limited Possession, the character does not gain control of
the new form. Instead, he must use persuasion, intimidation, or other
interaction skills to convince his host to do what he wishes.
Exiting a host body is commonly a simple action. As long as the
possessing character exits before the host dies, he simply moves
on to his own or another form. Killing a possessing spirit usually
involves taking it completely by surprise with a killing blow to the
host form or using a spell to force it to remain in the body until it
can be slain.

Chapter 2

Possession, Full (10)
The character can possess the body of a living creature or a corpse.
This works in the same way as Limited Possession, save that the possessing character gains her new form’s physical attributes (Agility,
Coordination, Physique), retains her own mental attributes (Intellect,
Acumen, Charisma), and gains complete control over the new form.

Quick Study (3)
The character has an uncanny ability to learn new skills and improve
old ones, limited to one attribute. He always learns new skills as if
he had a teacher (even if he doesn’t), and he can improve skills he
already knows at a cost of one Character Point less than normal. This
Special Ability applies to specializations and combines very well with
the Age Disadvantage, if the character is young — he is a prodigy,
and that’s why he’s learned his starting skills so quickly. This Special
Ability can be taken once for each attribute.

Sense of Direction (2)
The character has a good sense of direction. He gains +1D per
rank to navigation and tracking rolls.

Shapeshifting (3)
The character can manipulate the shape, color, and overall appearance of her body, though mass and body compositions remain the
same. The character must chose a speciﬁc creature to emulate, gaining one form for every three additional points spent on this Special
Ability. At six ranks in this ability, the gamemaster may allow shifting

Shapeshifting Example
Mel is playing a werebear. She chooses Shapeshifting,
specifying that she only changes from Human to werebear
and back again. The gamemaster decides she’ll gain one rank
of the Increased Attribute: Physique (+1 to related totals) and
+2 to all search and tracking totals that require smell when
in her werebear form.
Mel’s character has 18 attribute dice arranged thusly:
Agility 2D+2
Coordination 3D+1
Physique 3D
Intellect 2D+2
Acumen 2D+2
Charisma 3D+2
When she changes into werebear form, Mel’s character
has the following attribute values, the total of which has
been lowered by 2D because of the bonuses:
Agility 4D
Coordination 2D
Physique 3D+2
Intellect 2D+2
Acumen 2D+2
Charisma 1D

• Page 38

among one class of creatures (such as birds or furniture) as long as all
forms chosen for previous ranks were within the same class.
Body Points, Wounds, and the Intellect attribute remain unaffected by this Special Ability, but the dice in the Agility, Coordination,
Physique, Acumen, and Charisma are redistributed to match the new
form (although the die code in the mettle skill remains the same
regardless of the change in form). Additional dice in skills above
the base attribute score remain the same, though the total dice in
each skill changes to reﬂect the adjustments in the base attribute.
Likewise, not all skills will be usable in the new form.
Attribute dice can also be used to include Special Abilities in the
new form. One attribute die can be spent to gain one rank in one
Special Ability or to get a +2 skill total bonus (split among up to two
skills). The gamemaster may allow a larger skill total bonus or more
skills to fall under the bonus if the desired eﬀect is particularly narrow (such as a bonus for a single sense).
For an example of how Shapeshifting can work, see the accompanying sidebar.
Shapeshifting may be done at will, though a Limitation may force
it to be triggered by stress or environmental factors.
If shifting voluntarily, the character must generate a disguise total
of 11 to bring about the change, and a second total to turn back
again. Each change takes one full round in which the character may
do nothing else. Failure at the check means the transformation does
not occur, and the character cannot try again for at least an hour.
It is highly recommended that the hero comes up with some
typical forms and their game characteristics before beginning play.
The new form need not exactly resemble a “typical” version of the
emulated creature or object.

Silence (3)
The character can move in complete silence. He gains +2D per
rank to all stealth checks and a +1D per rank when attacking from
behind.

Skill Bonus (1)
Skill Bonus represents a natural talent (a character with the
Charismatic group might be “friendly and outgoing”), a particular
knack (a character with the Animal Friendship group has a “way
with animals”), years of devotion to a profession prior to beginning
adventure, or the result of an extended life.
The character chooses a group of three related skills in which he
gains +1 to the skill total of any action performed with those skills
(or specializations of that skill). The skills need not be under the
same attribute. The character may or may not actually have adds in
those skills, and the gamemaster must approve the fact that they are
“related.” Some examples of skill groups include:
Acting: bluﬀ, charm, disguise
Acute Balance: acrobatics, climbing, stealth
Animal Friendship: animal handling, riding, survival
Athletics: lifting, running, throwing
Charismatic: bluﬀ, charm, persuasion
Close Combat: ﬁghting, melee combat, dodge
Eidetic: reading/writing, scholar, investigation
Investigative: investigation, search, streetwise
Leadership: command, intimidation, persuasion

Character Options

• Page 39

Mechanical Aptitude: crafting, lockpicking, traps
Observant: investigation, search, tracking
Ranged Combat: dodge, marksmanship, throwing
Players may substitute other related skills for the ones listed in
the groups above, or create their own groups as long as there is a
common thread and the gamemaster approves the grouping.
Three specializations may replace one general skill, getting a +1
for three diﬀerent specializations. (The specializations don’t have to
be under the same general skill.) This may be done for up to all three
skills in the group, choosing six specializations instead of two skills
or nine specializations instead of three skills.
Example: In the Investigative group, a character might take out
streetwise and replace it with three specializations — streetwise:
thieves’ guilds, tracking: large towns, and persuasion: witnesses. While
this means the character gains no bonus for other streetwise activities (such as a roll to locate a criminal in a small town), he does have
a more “detailed” group.
Additionally, the character acts as if trained in these skills even
if he doesn’t have any additional pips in them, and so does not get
the unskilled modiﬁer. This Special Ability does not aﬀect the cost
of improving the related skills.
Gamemasters may allow a higher bonus for fewer skills (such as
a set of two skills where one gets a +1 bonus and the other gets a +2
bonus, or a +3 bonus to a set of three specializations). However, the
bonus per rank may total no more than +3.
At each additional rank, the player may increase the bonus by +1
for three of the skills aﬀected by this Special Ability. A character may
have diﬀerent versions of this ability for diﬀerent groups of skills,
though the skills in each group may not overlap.

Skill Minimum (4)
The character can select three related skills that will always gain
a minimum total of 3 times the number before the “D.”
Example: If the player selects persuasion, charm, and intimidation
(all interaction skills) for his character, all of which he has at 4D, and
he generates a total less than 12, the total automatically becomes
12. That is the character’s minimum total.
The player may not select Skill Minimum for any skill that has any
other Advantage or Special Ability tied to it. Also, the skills must be
related in some way (see the Skill Bonus Special Ability for information
on related skills). The character may only select general skills, but the
specializations underneath that general skill are aﬀected as well. This
Special Ability may be selected only once for each group of skills.

Teleportation (3)

the player must specify when his character gets the Special Ability.
Generally, this substance gives the character distinct advantages. The
player may select up to 4 points (not ranks) in other Special Abilities that relate to the chosen form, per rank in this Special Ability.
(Thus, two Transmutation ranks means 8 points in other Special
Abilities.) Natural Armor, Hardiness, and Environmental Resistance
are common ones.

Uncanny Aptitude (3)
This Special Ability is similar to the Skill Bonus Special Ability in
that some sort of bizarre ability gives the character added bonuses
to certain actions. However, instead of selecting a group of skills
that the character gains a bonus to, the player and the gamemaster
work out circumstances where these abilities come into play. For
instance, a character might gain a +1 bonus to all Agility-related skills
totals when in sunlight.
A character may have several variations of this ability, reﬂecting
diﬀerent bonuses. Each variation could have several ranks, with the
bonuses adding to each other.

The character can move instantly to another place up to 10 meters
per rank away. The character must see her destination clearly. In
combat, this action takes an entire round. The character may take
along whatever she can carry.

Ventriloquism (3)

Transmutation (5)

Water Breathing (2)

The character can alter his substance to something else, while
retaining his form (such as a man who turns to stone). Characters
with this ability may only shift into one speciﬁc substance, which

The character can breathe water and will not drown underwater.
She gains +1D per rank to all swimming rolls because she doesn’t
need to worry about drowning.

The character can throw her voice up to three meters away per rank.
No skill roll is required to do this, but if it is part of a trick attempt,
she receives a +2D bonus per rank to bluﬀ and charm rolls.

Chapter 2

Youthful Appearance (1)

• Page 40

The character looks much younger than she actually is and
receives a +1D per rank to bluﬀ, charm, or disguise attempts that
involve posing as someone youthful. In general, characters should
not look more than 10 to 20 years younger than they are, regardless of the number of ranks, though gamemaster discretion and
common sense should rule here.

Special Ability Enhancements
Enhancements allow Special Abilities to be somehow more than
the typical version. Each Enhancement may be taken more than
once for each Special Ability, either altering the ability in similar
though distinct ways or, for some, through stacking the eﬀects. The
cost of the Enhancement adds to the associated Special Ability’s
total cost (base cost plus the cost for additional ranks).
Additional Eﬀect (1): The Special Ability produces a useful, though
minor, side eﬀect that is a natural extension of the power. The more
useful the side eﬀect, the greater the number of ranks. Some examples
include a skill bonus when using the ability, doing residual damage (such
as reﬂection with Natural Armor or setting ﬁres with Natural Ranged
Weapon), or adding functionality to an Extra Body Part.
Bestow (1 or more): The character may share her Special Ability
with a certain type of target: sentient living, nonsentient living, or
nonliving. The player must chose which group when including this
Enhancement. The cost of this Enhancement equals one-half (rounded
up) of the Special Ability total (base cost plus additional ranks cost plus
Enhancement costs). She may only use her Special Ability on herself
and on members of her target group with a multi-action penalty. The
character may give her Special Ability to one person per action.
Some Special Abilities will require better stories concerning how
the character can manage sharing them than others (such as Youthful Appearance or Ambidextrous), while others may not have this
Enhancement (such as Longevity or Immortality). The target has
control over the use of the Bestowed Special Ability for as long as the
Bestowing character allows. A character may only have one rank in
this Enhancement, but she may have multiple versions of it.
Extended Range (3): The factor used to determine the range
of the character’s Special Ability is increased. Every rank of this
Enhancement allows the player to add one half of the ranks in the
Special Ability (rounded up) to the factor when determining the
range. Thus, to increase the range factor by half the ranks costs
three, by the ranks in the ability costs six, by 1.5 times the ranks
costs nine, and so on.
Example: The range for Natural Ranged Weapon is 20 times the
number of ranks in the Special Ability times the character’s Physique
or lifting in meters. With two ranks of Extended Range, the range
would now be 20 times twice the number of ranks in the Special
Ability times the character’s Physique or lifting.
Magically Empowered (4 for 1 rank; 5 for 2 ranks): The Special
Ability comes from a magical source — a feature of the character’s
species, a result of the character’s parentage, a means of explaining
a mysterious ancient artifact, and so on. A Special Ability provided
by a spell does not need this Enhancement, nor does Natural Magick
require it. A magic item created for a character because of the Equipment Advantage would.

Two ranks exist for this Enhancement. At Rank 1, with a cost of
four, the power with this Enhancement has a magical power source,
but it is not truly magical in nature. If it does damage, protective
Special Abilities or magical spells of any defensive nature can defend
against it as normal. It can act on characters in astral form, spirits,
and other magical creatures or magical items not aﬀected by normal
harm. It does harm to those beings and items at one-half of its damage total, before modiﬁers and rounded down.
If it provides protection, it defends at one-half its total, before
modiﬁers and rounded down, against magical blasts or Special Abilities
that demons, ghosts, and other magical or spiritual beings have.
In both cases, these bonuses are in addition to the normal applications of the Special Ability.
At Rank 2, with a cost of ﬁve, the power with this Enhancement is
magical in nature. If it does damage, protective Special Abilities only
defend at one-half their die code (rounded down) against its attacks,
but the Enhanced Special Ability can be completely shielded against
by other magical Special Abilities (protecting Special Abilities with
this Enhancement; spells that protect against magical attacks; and
protective versions of Natural Magick). It can be used against spirits,
astral beings, and other magical or spiritual creatures or magical items
not aﬀected by normal harm. For both cases, this is in addition to
the regular manifestations of the Special Ability.
If the Special Ability with this level of Enhancement provides protection to the character, it can defend against normal and magical powers
(oﬀensive Special Abilities with this Enhancement; damage-dealing
spells; and protective versions of Natural Magick; Special Abilities of
a magical nature possessed by demons, ghosts, and the like).
To include this Enhancement with a Special Ability in an item,
the item’s Special Ability should also have the Limitation Burn-out
(R1), item can be lost or stolen.
Multiple Targets (2): The character may use the Special Ability
more than once per round without incurring a multi-action penalty.
For each rank in this Enhancement, the character gains one additional
use of the Special Ability. This adds to any other bonus actions provided by a power; it does not multiply it.

Special Ability Limitations
These Limitations can be associated with Special Abilities, restricting their functionality and reducing their total cost (base cost plus

Character Options
the cost for additional ranks plus any Enhancements — not the per
rank cost).
Limitations may not lower a Special Ability’s total cost below one,
and all Limitations must have some sort of eﬀect on play — just like
Disadvantages. Each of a character’s Special Abilities may have more
than one of each Limitation, as they can either describe similar but
distinct negative situations or, in some cases, stack the eﬀects.
Ability Loss (3 for 1 rank; 4 for 2 ranks): The character temporarily loses his Special Ability at regular intervals or, when the
Special Ability is used, he loses the ability to use a common skill in
which he has experience (that is, additional pips or dice). Examples
include: a character who cannot shapeshift when the sun is out; a
character who cannot use his natural weapons on a particular day
of the month or during a certain phase of the moon. The character
is aware of what the circumstances are that will cause this. For an
additional point and additional rank, the character must undergo
some sort of (fairly simple) procedure to regain his ability or skill
use. A Special Ability may have up to two ranks in a single variation
of this Limitation, but a character may have it multiple times for
diﬀerent Special Abilities, circumstances, or combinations of Special
Abilities and skills.
Allergy (3 for 1 rank; 4 for 2 ranks): The character has a minor
allergy. Exposure to a fairly common substance (smoke, sunlight, particular food, etc.) causes the character to lose all Critical Success rerolls
until the condition is removed. For an additional point and additional
rank, the eﬀects are worse, and the character loses all actions due to
coughing ﬁts, watering eyes, or similar discomfort until she can get
away from the allergen. A Special Ability may only have one rank in
this Limitation, though it may have several diﬀerent Allergies.
Burn-out (1): See the Disadvantage by this name for suggestions that could also be applied to a Special Ability. The more likely
the Burn-out, the greater the number of ranks in this Limitation.
A Special Ability may have multiple variations of this Limitation,
representing diﬀerent triggers for the Burn-out.
Debt (3): Someone (or, more likely, some entity) gave the character
the Special Ability, along with certain obligations and restrictions.
The character must continually beg the giver to retain the Special
Ability, or she must perform certain tasks at the giver’s request in
exchange for continued use of the Special Ability. A Special Ability
may only have one rank in this Limitation.
Flaw (1): All diﬃculties associated with using the Special Ability
are increased by +2 per rank. The greater the rank associated with
this Flaw, the greater the diﬃculty modiﬁer.
Minor Stigma (3): The character cannot use the Special Ability
without performing the “proper rituals” before or after (someone with
a natural weapon who must sketch an image of his intended victim
before hunting him down; a shapeshifter who must be puriﬁed by
his cult after killing someone). A Special Ability may only have one
rank in this Limitation.
Others Only (2 for 1 rank; 3 for 2 ranks; 4 for 3 ranks): The
character may not use the Special Ability himself; he may only allow
others to use it. The value of this Limitation depends on how many
groups of “others” he can use it on: For two points and one rank, the
character may aﬀect sentient living, nonsentient living, and nonliving
targets. For three points and two ranks, the character can aﬀect only

• Page 41

two of the three groups. For four points and three ranks, the character
can aﬀect only one of the three groups. This Limitation may not be
taken more than once per Special Ability. Additionally, like the Bestow
Enhancement, some Special Abilities may require valid reasons before
the gamemaster allows the Limitation’s inclusion. Some abilities, such
as Immortality and Longevity, may not have this Limitation. The target
who gets the Special Ability has control over its use as if she actually
had the ability, for as long as the giving character allows.
Allowing another person access to the Special Ability counts as
an action for its owner, while using the newfound Special Ability
counts as as an action for the one who gets it (though gaining access
to it does not). The Special Ability’s owner may only give the Special
Ability to one character per round, but the target may be diﬀerent
each round.
Price (1): The character must fulﬁll certain obligations in order
to use the Special Ability. Perhaps when using Water Breathing, the
character must remain in the water for at least 24 hours for every
24 hours out of it or suﬀer -4 modiﬁer per rank in this Limitation to
his damage resistance total for changing environments so quickly.
Alternatively, there could be a Character or Fate Point fee of three
Character Points per rank in the Limitation per adventure in which
the character uses the Special Ability.
Restricted (1): The Special Ability is hindered in a way not covered by any other Limitation. The more restrictive the situation, the
greater the number of ranks in this Limitation. For instance, a Natural
Weapon (either kind) may only be useful against certain creatures. A
Special Ability may have multiple variations of this Limitation, each
representing a diﬀerent restraint.
Side Eﬀect (2): One of the character’s Special Abilities has some
sort of annoying side eﬀect that appears with its use, such as constant
whistling, a continuous glow, or a terrible stench. Add 4 per rank to
the diﬃculty of all stealth attempts when the Special Ability is in use,
as everyone can ﬁgure out she’s coming. This will also aﬀect interaction attempts, adding at least a +1 per rank to the diﬃculty.
Singularity (1 per Special Ability): The character may use
only one of a group of two or more Special Abilities each round. It
does not take an action to switch Special Abilities. He may change
the Special Ability in use at the beginning of his turn in a round,
and he may rely on the chosen Special Ability until the next time he
changes it. For a second rank (and one additional point per Special
Ability), it does take an action to switch Special Abilities. A Special
Ability may not have more than two ranks in this Limitation, and
all Special Abilities in the same group must have this Limitation at
the same rank. Not all of a character’s Special Abilities need be in
the same Singularity group.
Super-science (2): The Special Ability is contained in a piece
of equipment — such as a arquebus, a staﬀ, or a ring — developed
through a technological means not readily available and certainly
experimental (it could even be from the future). The item could be
lent to another character or taken away with a successful grab and
used by someone else, though at a +5 to the diﬃculty. On a Critical
Failure, the item malfunctions and requires repair. Unless combined
with the Burn-out Limitation, a destroyed item may be recreated in a
number of days equal to the total cost of the Special Ability (including
all ranks, Enhancements, and Limitations).

CHAPTER III

• Non-Human Races •
What’s in This Chapter
Some, though certainly not all, fantasy settings feature humanoid
races of equal or greater standing than the Humans themselves. This
chapter generalizes a few of the more common ones. Gamemasters
can modify these generic characters to suit their setting or use them
to design their own non-Human races.
When creating a new racial template, every character based on
that species must have certain background Special Abilities, Disadvantages, and possibly Advantages. However, enough points should
remain with which the player may customize the character. Usually,
the character ends up with more options than normal for the average
person in the game setting, but fewer than if the player had stuck
with Human. (Experienced members of the race should have more
skills and, perhaps, higher levels of the template’s Special Abilities
and Disadvantages.)
When making new packages, to help them balance with what’s
available to Humans, account for any potential alteration to
attribute minimums and maximums through Special Abilities and
Disadvantages.
Regardless of the race, unless they take the Language Problems
Disadvantage, characters can speak Trade Speech and their native
language.
Players may overlay the packages on any other character template.
Disadvantages received from these packages do not count toward
the maximum number of Disadvantages set by the gamemaster.
Body Points for “typical” characters were added to a gamemaster’s
character base of 10.

Dwarves
Stocky and short, Dwarves come from the mountains. They build
great halls and winding tunnels. They are considered some of the
ﬁnest workers of metals and gems. Though they do grow plants for
food, they have a general dislike for spaces open to the sky.

Elves
The Elves’ very slenderness tends to make them seem taller than
Humans, though their actual size varies depending on where they call
home. The most common variety hail from forests, but ones living
in mountains or seas are not unknown. Wherever they come from,
they all share an aﬃnity for nature and a sense of duty toward the
animals and things of their native environment.

Gnomes
Renowned tinkers, Gnomes enjoy building their homes in hillsides,
much as Dwarves do. Somewhat taller and broader than Dwarves,
the Dwarves outmass Gnomes. Gnomes commonly use magic to
enhance their inventions.

Reptile Folk
Slightly taller than Humans, Reptile Folk prefer scrubland on the
edges of deserts. Their nomadic lifestyle and natural armor has made
them terriﬁc hunters and trackers. This innate protection also supports
their belief that they are superior to all other life in the world.

CHAPTER IV

• Improving Characters •
What’s in this Chapter
Once players have taken their characters through an adventure or
three, they’ll want to improve or change them. This chapter provides
guidelines for accomplishing that.

Learning & Improving Skills
When a player ﬁrst creates a character, she should use the character
creation guidelines for gaining attributes and skills.
Players whose characters have been through at least one adventure
can use Character Points, accumulated from completing adventures,
to learn new skills and improve old ones. Spending Character Points
this way may be done only between adventures.
In addition to Character Points, the character needs experience
with the skill, either through training or by attempting to use the
skill (through rolling its die code or its governing attribute’s die code,
regardless of the outcome) during an adventure. If the gamemaster
decides that there is a signiﬁcant amount of training involved (such
as improving a skill beyond 6D), or the character needs to ﬁnd a suitable teacher, that might become an adventure’s focus. (The teacher
must have a skill die code higher than the one the potential student
currently has.)
The cost of getting one pip in a new base skill equals the number
before the “D” in the governing attribute’s die code.
Example: If a character wants to learn reading/writing after an
adventure and he has a Intellect die code of 3D, the ﬁrst pip in reading/writing costs him three Character Points. The hero then has a
3D+1 in his reading/writing skill.
The cost of improving an existing skill is determined in the same
way, except that the number of dice in the skill (instead of in the
attribute) is used to determine the cost.
Example: A character has a dodge of 4D+2 and wants to increase
it. To raise the skill by one pip to 5D, the character must spend four
Character Points. To increase the skill to 5D+1 after the next scenario,
the character must spend ﬁve Character Points.
The cost to get one pip in a new specialization equals one-half of
the number before the “D” in the governing attribute or skill’s die
code. The cost to improve an existing specialization by one pip equals
one-half of the number before the “D” in specialization skill’s die
code. (In both cases, round up.)
A character does not need the governing skill to get a specialization in it. However, if he does have one, getting a specialization
in it acts as a bonus to the base skill when taking actions of that
type, but it does not also improve all uses of the base skill.
Example: For a character with 6D in marksmanship to gain a
bow and arrow specialization, he needs to spend three Character

Points to get a +1 in the specialization. The full marksmanship skill,
however, stays at 6D.
Specializations that are associated with a full skill improve when
the base skill improves.
A character may improve a skill or any of its specializations but
not both. In other words, a character may improve as many specializations as he desires at the same time, though he cannot improve
them at the same time as he’s improving the governing skill. Skills
and specializations may only be improved by one pip each in between
each adventure.
Once characters reach 8D in a skill, gamemasters may choose to
use the upper limit rule for improving attributes (see that section
for details).
Extranormal skills cost twice as much to learn as other skills. Skills
gained due to a Special Ability are not improved when that Special
Ability is improved. Instead, they are increased as a normal skill.

Improving Strength Damage
As a character’s Physique or lifting goes up or is altered by Special
Abilities, Disadvantages, or skill improvement, reﬁgure the Strength
Damage die code: Take the character’s new Physique or lifting (including
any modiﬁers from Disadvantages or Special Abilities) and drop the pips.
Divide by 2, and round up. This is the Strength Damage die code.

Improving Attributes
With the exception of Extranormal and Funds, the attributes you
choose for your character usually represent her maximum potential.
Most of the time, you’ll improve your character’s attributes by training in one particular aspect (improving skills) or through temporary
means (taking drugs or wearing magical equipment). Nonetheless,
some freak mystical accident or a supernatural encounter might
provide you with a reason to improve your character’s base attributes.
(Some characters, such as kids, might start with fewer attribute dice,
but their excuse for their attributes’ improvement is puberty.) There
are two ways to do this.
The ﬁrst way is how kids improve their normal attributes and how
everyone improves their Extranormal attributes. The gamemaster may

Effects of Character Options
When determining how many Character Points a player needs to
improve his character’s skills and attributes, ignore any modiﬁers
provided by Advantages, Disadvantages, or Special Abilities.

Improving Characters
chose to use this option for adult characters who want to increase
their normal attributes.
In the ﬁrst method, to boost an attribute by one pip costs 10 times
the number before the attribute’s “D” in Character Points. Generally,
a single attribute may be raised only one pip per adventure, though
it’s possible that the eﬀects of the situation inﬂuence the character’s
physical makeup for a while or the gamemaster may decide that the
situation was so life-changing that more than one attribute may be
boosted by more than one pip.
There is an upper limit using this method: Every time an adult
character boosts a normal attribute, the player rolls that attribute’s
new die code and the gamemaster rolls one die less than the maximum
die code for the species, including any appropriate Special Abilities.
(The maximum for all attributes except Extranormal and Funds is 5D,
unless altered by a Special Ability or Disadvantage, so the gamemaster
would roll 4D. For skills, the gamemaster uses 7D or 1D less than his
preferred maximum.) If the gamemaster’s roll equals or exceeds the
player’s roll, the attribute improves. If it does not, the attribute does
not improve, the character gets half the Character Points back, and
the character has reached her upper limit for that attribute. Ignore
this upper limit rule for Funds and Extranormal attributes.
In the second way, the gamemaster requires all adult characters
to take the Increased Attribute Special Ability (discussed in the
“Character Options” chapter) in order to improve their Agility, Coordination, Physique, Intellect, Acumen, and Charisma attributes. It has
the added simplicity of, instead of raising dice, adding to the total
rolled. There is no maximum bonus that the character may gain with
this method, aside from whatever roleplaying or adventure obstacles
the gamemaster decides to include.

Improving Body Points
As a character’s Physique goes up or is altered by Special Abilities
or Disadvantages, you’ll need to change the Body Points amount.
Whenever Physique permanently reaches a new full die above or
below the old one, roll the die, ignoring any pips or other modiﬁers.
(Do not reroll the character’s entire Physique — only the amount that
changed.) Then add or subtract, as dictated by the Special Ability or
Disadvantage, that number from the Body Points total.

Improving Wounds
As a character’s Body Points go up or down, the Wound level changes.
For characters who rely solely on Wounds, the only way to alter how
quickly or slowly the character reaches each level is by changing his
damage resistance total. This could be through a change in Physique or
by acquiring more protective gear or protecting Special Abilities.

Gaining & Losing
Character Options
As players take their characters through adventures and develop
them, they may decide that the Advantages, Disadvantages, and
Special Abilities the characters started with don’t ﬁt the current
concept. To be ﬂexible, there are ways you can accommodate your
players’ desire to grow their characters. For example, an “enemy”
might eventually be killed, a character might be able to negotiate a
way out of Debt, or an Advantage Flaw might be “repaired.”

• Page 45

Getting rid of and gaining Advantages, Special Abilities, and
Disadvantages should only happen after the character has been used
during several adventures and has had a chance to come up with
reasons for character alteration.
These game mechanics for gaining Advantages, Special Abilities,
and Disadvantages apply only to individuals who actively seek them.
Because of an adventure or series of adventures, the members of a
group may each acquire the same new Advantage or Disadvantage.
In this case, each hero does not pay the cost or receive any Character
Point beneﬁts outlined here. The new Advantage can be considered
a reward for being part of the team and the scenario,
while the new Disadvantage would be a penalty.

Advantages
There are two methods for acquiring new Advantages: (1) The player pays, in Character Points, 5 times the rank of
the Advantage. (2) The player takes an equivalent amount of ranks
in Disadvantages and pays a number of Character Points equal to
the rank of the Advantage. In either case, the player must come up
with a well-crafted story for getting the new Advantage that’s backed
by actual experiences in one or more adventures. The story, and its
related Advantage, must be approved by the gamemaster.
Generally, a player may not remove an Advantage from a character,
but it might be lost in the course of roleplaying due to player negligence
(that is, continuously bad roleplaying or ignoring Disadvantages) or
some tragic game-world mishap (such as a Patron’s city being destroyed).
If the loss occurred through no fault of the character, the gamemaster
may give the player a consolation gift of three Character Points per rank
in the Advantage, or may substitute an equally valuable Advantage.
Gamemasters should not reward the loss of an Advantage through
player negligence.

Disadvantages
There are also two methods for permanently
overcoming a Disadvantage:
(1) The player pays 10
times the die code of the Disadvantage. (2) The player loses an equal
number of Advantages and pays a number of Character Points equal
to the die code of the Disadvantage. As with Advantages, the player
must have a good tale and adequate adventuring experience before
the gamemaster should approve the loss of any Disadvantage.
Example: If a character had Equipment (R3), he might also have
a Rank 3 Disadvantage tied to it. If the character can get rid of the
equipment (which he might not be able to do in some settings — a
cursed sword, for example), then the Disadvantage goes away.
When a player wishes to add another Disadvantage to her hero,
she receives an immediate bonus for this choice if she isn’t using the
Disadvantage to help her get a new Advantage. For the new Disadvantage, the character receives a number of Character Points equal
to 3 times the die code of the Disadvantage. However, the hero now
has a new limitation to contend with!

Special Abilities
Unless the gamemaster decides to reward a character with a Special Ability, it costs 5 times the sum of the Special Ability’s base cost
plus the current number of ranks in Character Points — and a really

Chapter 4

• Page 46

good excuse — to acquire or improve a Special Ability after character
creation. A character may improve a Special Ability by only one rank
after each adventure, unless there is some compelling reason to allow
otherwise. Gamemasters may disallow increases in Special Abilities
if they feel the reason for the improvement isn’t good enough.
Example: A character has Accelerated Healing at Rank 1. She decides
to spend some time in a monastery, learning how to improve it. The
cost in Character Points to increase her Special Ability to Rank 2 is 16
(5 times the sum of the base cost of 3 plus the current rank of 1).
Characters can have their Special Abilities weakened and occasionally even lose them entirely, and they get no reward for this. In other
circumstances, the character could wish to use all his mental and
spiritual resources to defeat an otherwise unstoppable force.
In these instances, by sacriﬁcing one rank in a Special Ability,
a character receives 2 times the base cost of the Special Ability in
Character Points. If the player wants to remove completely a Special
Ability from the character, however, he reduces the Special Ability to
one rank, receiving Character Points for each rank lost, as above. In
sacriﬁcing the ﬁnal rank of the Special Ability, the character receives
in Character Points 7 times the initial cost of the Special Ability. Costs
of Enhancements and Limitations are ignored. The character also,
of course, loses all Enhancements and Limitations associated with
that Special Ability when he permanently sacriﬁces it. (Getting the
Special Ability back requires the character to spend Character Points
for it as a new Special Ability.)
Character Points gained by selling oﬀ a Special Ability must
be used before the end of the scene. The hero can sacriﬁce a part
of his essence to accomplish legendary deeds, but he cannot use
those Character Points to purchase skills or otherwise improve his
character. Any Character Points not spent by the end of the scene
are forever lost.
The act of losing Special Abilities does not typically count as an
action. Even so, some circumstances may justify a Moderate mettle roll
or the character’s complete concentration for a full round to simulate
the character summoning his deep inner resources.
The player can combine losing Special Abilities with gaining
Special Abilities to simulate an event that alters the character’s
extraordinary abilities completely. In this case, if the gamemaster
accepts the player’s explanation, simply trade the hero’s current
Special Abilities for Character Points and spend them on the desired
new Special Abilities.

Gaining & Losing Special Ability
Enhancements & Limitations
It is possible for a character to gain or lose control over a Special
Ability, beyond what increases in skill and Special Ability rank allow.
Unlike Advantages and Disadvantages, Special Ability Enhancements
and Limitations are fundamental to a Special Ability’s manifestation in a character or item. Enhancements and Limitations must
be purchased or overcome with Character Points, representing the
character’s greater understanding of the Special Ability. Also, the
gamemaster may not allow some Limitations to be bought oﬀ without
an excellent plot-related explanation, especially if the Limitation is
physical in nature. Unless the Enhancement or Limitation relates to
the character’s understanding of the Special Ability, such as many

Minor Stigmas, a reasonable explanation of how the Special Ability
has changed is also required.
Gaining a new Enhancement costs 8 times the desired rank times
the base cost of the Enhancement in Character Points. Although most
Enhancements have several possible ranks that can be purchased in
stages, common sense should apply. A Special Ability may obtain
new levels for the same Enhancement, but the nature of previously
added Enhancements cannot be altered, unless the Enhancements
are removed.
Example: An Enhancement that provides an extra eﬀect must be
purchased at the full cost of each desired eﬀect. A player could not,
for instance, buy one rank of Additional Eﬀect: Energy Sustenance
for Attack Resistance, and then later spend more Character Points
to increase the Enhancement rank and change it to attack reﬂection.
However, a character with an Additional Eﬀect of stickiness on the
Natural Ranged Weapon Special Ability could purchase additional
ranks of the version of the Enhancement.
Eliminating a Limitation costs 10 times the die code of the Limitation in Character Points. As with Enhancements, it is possible to buy
oﬀ a Limitation in stages, if the stages are related. The Debt Limitation
probably couldn’t be bought down one level at a time, but a Flaw with
multiple ranks could be, if the Narrator allowed. The gamemaster
may disallow buying oﬀ certain variations of Limitations because
they are inextricably tied to the related Special Ability.
A character can also remove an Enhancement or acquire a Limitation after character creation. A character who purposely removes an
Enhancement from a Special Ability receives 4 times the rank times
the base cost of the Enhancement in Character Points. The character can’t rely on the Enhancement until the player buys it again. A
character who takes a Limitation for a Special Ability after character
creation gains 5 times the rank times the base cost of the Limitation
in Character Points. Since it is unlikely (though not impossible) that
a character would do either of these deliberately, the player must
come up with a reasonable explanation for how the Special Ability has become less useful. Again, the gamemaster may take away
Enhancement or Limitations based on the adventure situation and
does not necessarily have to award points for it.

CHAPTER V

• Game Basics •
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter deﬁnes how to play the game, from rolling the dice
to using skills. The basic unit of game time, order of play, and what
players can have their characters do on a turn are explained. Suggestions for determining the diﬃculty of actions are oﬀered, including
some examples.
The introduction oﬀered an overview of how the game works, so
some of this may look familiar. However, this chapter clariﬁes a lot
of special situations that undoubtedly will come up during play.

Rolling Dice
A die code shows how good a character is in a particular area, how
harmful a weapon is, how useful a Special Ability or tool is, and so
on. Each die code (also known as a value) indicates the number of
six-sided dice you roll (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, etc.), and sometimes an
added bonus of “+1” or “+2” — referred to as pips — you add to the
total result you roll on the dice.
An Advantage, Special Ability, or piece of equipment may provide
a bonus to the roll. If the bonus is in the form of a die code (such as
+1D), then you add the listed number of regular dice to the amount
you would roll. If the bonus is in the form of a number (such as +2),
then you add the amount to the total that you rolled on the dice.
Example: A shovel adds 1D to digging attempts. A character
who decides to dig a hole uses her lifting skill. If your character has
a lifting skill of 4D, you would roll ﬁve dice to determine how well
your character dug the hole with the shovel.

Wild Die
Whenever any player, including the gamemaster, makes any roll,
one of the dice must be diﬀerent from the rest (in size or color).
Designated as the Wild Die, this odd die represents the vagaries
of life — like the direction of the wind aﬀecting the ﬂight of
a bullet — that are too small to warrant their own diﬃculty
modiﬁers.
Example: Your character’s Agility attribute is 3D+1, so if
your character tried to jump onto a table, you would roll two
regular dice and one Wild Die.
If the player has only 1D to roll, then that one die is always
the Wild Die.
If the player rolls a 6 on the Wild Die, this is called a Critical
Success and she may add the 6 to her total and roll the Wild Die
again. As long as she turns up Critical Successes on that die, she
may continue to add them to her total and continue to roll. If
she rolls anything other than a 6, she adds that number to the
total and stops rolling.

If the player rolls a 1 on the initial toss of the Wild Die, this is
called a Critical Failure, and the gamemaster may chose one of two
options for the result, depending on the gravity of the situation.
1. The Critical Failure cancels out the highest roll. Then the player
adds the remaining values, and the roll is determined normally.
2. Add the dice results normally, but a complication occurs. The
gamemaster gauges the signiﬁcance of the complication by the total
generated — from a funny, “nearly didn’t do it” result for a high total
to a serious, “we have a problem” obstacle for a low total. The gamemaster could even decide that nothing happens — for now — and
use it as an excuse to spring a complication at a later time.
When using the second option, make certain the complication
chosen relates to the task attempted. It should serve as an extra,
minor obstacle the characters must now deal with or, more often, as
a place to insert a bit of comic relief. Only on rare occasions (such as
numerous poor decisions by the players) should a complication be
without solutions or even deadly. The complications can also serve
as opportunities to bring nearly invincible characters down to a more
reasonable level.
Note: Unlike rolling a Critical Failure initially on the Wild Die, no
complications occur when a 1 shows up on later tosses of the Wild
Die in the same roll.

Improving a Roll
The average person fails at average activities nearly half of the time.
Characters aren’t average people, so they need ways to beat those
odds. Thus, they have Character and Fate Points, which represent
those surges of adrenaline, sudden insights, and other unexplained
helpful acts of chance.
Players may not trade Character Points for Fate Points, nor may
they trade Fate Points for Character Points. A player may only spend

Alternate Die Rolling Options
Some gamemasters prefer rolling fewer dice. To this end, a die
code simpliﬁcation chart has been included on page 142. It oﬀers
two solutions for reducing the number of dice while retaining some
of the randomness of rolling dice.
For converting die codes in the middle of a game without referencing the table, multiply the number in front of the “D” by 3 for tasks that
ought to fail (such as the damage resistance total of a cannon fodder
character) or 4 for actions that ought to succeed (such as something
the players’ characters are doing). Add the pips to the total.

Chapter 5

her Character and Fate Points on her character’s rolls. She may not
spend more Character or Fate Points than the character has listed on
her sheet. Except when allowed by the gamemaster for exceptionally
cinematic situations, players may not use Character Points and Fate
Points on the same roll.

Character Points
Whenever a player makes any roll (attribute, skill, damage, Special
Ability, and so on), he has the option to spend Character Points to
increase the total rolled. He may spend one Character Point for each
extra Wild Die rolled, to a maximum decided upon by the gamemaster
and based on the challenge level of the adventure. (For adventures
with easy challenges, the maximum is two; for more cinematic
adventures, the maximum is ﬁve; for universe-shaking ones, the
maximum is unlimited.)
A player may choose to spend Character Points before or after he
makes a roll — or both — but always before the gamemaster determines the result. The gamemaster need not tell the player whether
he should spend more points to improve a roll.
Extra Wild Dice gained from spending Character Points each work
like a normal Wild Die except that a Critical Failure counts as a 1;
it does not adversely aﬀect the roll. Because of the special nature
of Character Point Wild Dice, the player may wish to roll these dice
separately from his normal Wild Die.
Once used, the character loses the point. Players get Character
Points for their characters by overcoming obstacles, roleplaying well,
and having fun. They can also use Character Points to improve skills
(see the “Improving Characters” chapter for details).

Fate Points
Each players’ character has a personal moral code, generally
involving a sense of honor and justice. The devotion to this code is
represented by Fate Points. Violating that code takes a little bit away
from that nature, which is represented by a loss of Fate Points.

•

Page 48

Example: Heroic characters receive Fate Points for doing good,
such as protecting innocents, bringing an evil character to justice
(regardless of the justice system’s ﬁnal decision), preventing damage,
and saving a life (except the character’s own). Heroic characters lose
Fate Points for performing evil actions, such as stealing, maliciously
destroying property, taking a life, and other terrible acts, especially
if they use Fate Points to accomplish that harm.
Individual ethical codes may diﬀer from the heroic code, but the more
well-deﬁned the code is, the easier it is for the gamemaster to determine
when to reward Fate Points — and when to take them away.
When a player feels she needs even greater help for her roll, she
may spend a Fate Point to double the number of dice she normally
gets for that roll. However, the player only rolls one Wild Die. Furthermore, anything that’s not part of the character — weapon damage
die codes, equipment bonuses, and so on — is not doubled.
Example: Your character has a devices skill with a die code of
4D+2. Normally, you would roll three regular dice and one Wild Die
and add two pips to the total. But this time, you want to make sure
the villain’s siege engine can’t complete its purpose, so you spend a
Fate Point. This allows you to roll seven regular dice and one Wild
Die and add four pips to the total (for a total of 8D+4, or twice what
you’d normally roll).
Usually, a player may use only one Fate Point per roll per round,
though a character may improve several diﬀerent actions in a
round with several diﬀerent Fate Points expenditures. Particularly
beneﬁcial or malicious deeds presented and roleplayed well by the
player or gamemaster may allow additional Fate Points to be spent
on a single roll.
In the general course of play, a Fate Point is useful for one roll
only. However, once per game session, a player may choose to spend
a Fate Point climactically, which doubles all of the character’s rolls
for that round. The gamemaster also may allow players to spend Fate
Points climactically several times during the highest point of the
adventure (the climax).

Game Basics
Players may only spend Fate Points before making a roll. Furthermore, double the initial number before applying any die code
penalties and bonuses.
Once used, the character loses the Fate Point — but she may earn
it back at the end of the game if it was used for a deed that supported
her moral code. However, if the character used a Fate Point to go
against her moral code, the gamemaster may decide that it costs an
additional Fate Point.
As characters become more experienced, the gamemaster may
include further restrictions on Fate Point use. Gamemasters might
allow moderately experienced characters (those with at least 6D in
several skills) to spend Fate Points only on actions that promote the
story line, while highly experienced characters (those with at least 9D
in several skills) might be permitted to use Fate Points only during
climactic moments in the campaign.

Using Skills
At those times when there’s a chance that a character may fail
at an action, that character must make a skill check. The player
decides what she wants her character to do and which skill is best
for accomplishing the task (sometimes with the help of the gamemaster). The gamemaster determines a suitable diﬃculty number,
which the player must meet or beat by rolling the number of dice in
the skill and adding the results.

Untrained Skill Use
If a character doesn’t have dice in the skill required to attempt
an action, she generally may use the die code of the attribute under
which that skill falls. This is sometimes referred to as defaulting to
the attribute or using the skill untrained or unskilled. The gamemaster may include an unskilled modiﬁer to the diﬃculty. This
modiﬁer takes into account that people who aren’t trained or don’t
have experience in certain tasks usually have a harder time doing
them. Typically, this modiﬁer is +5, but it could be as low as +1 for
simple tasks or much higher for complex plans. The gamemaster may
rule that some situations, such as building a spaceship or performing brain surgery, are impossible for anyone to attempt without the
proper training and the correct skills.
When attributes are given in the text along with the skill, such as
in spell descriptions, resisting Wounds, and so on, do not apply the
untrained modiﬁer. This also includes most uses of dodge and ﬁghting
in combat situations, attempts to ﬁnd clues in a room with search,
and resisting interaction attempts or mental attacks with mettle.

• Page 49

Alternate Attribute Option
Sometimes it makes more sense to base a skill on a diﬀerent
attribute than the one it’s under by default. In such cases as the
gamemaster designates, subtract the skill value from the attribute
value to get the number of skill adds. Then add those skill adds to the
new attribute and roll away. Some example alternate skill-attribute
combinations (and the reason for using each attribute) include:
• Climbing, jumping, running, swimming: Physique for distance; Agility for obstacles
• Command: Charisma for leading others; Intellect for determining tactics
• Disguise: Acumen for creating the disguise, especially on someone else; Charisma for pulling oﬀ a disguise
• Flying: Physique for wings or to represent the physical strain
of rapid movement; Agility for obstacles
• Healing: Intellect for information and diagnosing; Coordination
for performing surgery
• Riding: Agility for using mounts as a means of transportation;
Agility for evaluating a mount or another’s style
• Traps: Intellect for information and recognizing systems; Acumen for setting traps

Game Time
Generally, time in a roleplaying game doesn’t matter too much. A
character may spend several hours searching a library, though only a
minute passes as far as the players and gamemaster are concerned.
To keep the story line moving, sometimes it’s necessary to skip the
tedious parts.
More intense scenes require more detail. In these cases, time
slows to units of ﬁve seconds called rounds. Each character may take
one action in the round with no penalty. Unless the character has
special skills or abilities, additional actions increase the diﬃculty of
performing each task; this concept is dealt with later, in the “Multiple
Actions” section. Once a round ends, the next one begins, continuing until the scene ends (with the task completed, the opponent
subdued, and so on).
Since all characters in a scene are making actions in the same ﬁvesecond round, the actual length of game time taken up by an action is
usually less than ﬁve seconds. This is obviously the case when a single
character is performing multiple actions, but it is also true when one
character reacts to what another character is doing. Actions in rounds
are not simultaneous (actions out of rounds sometimes are).

Initiative
Game-Enhancing Cards
In this rulebook, you’ll occasionally ﬁnd references to “card use.” One
of the unique features of certain West End Games systems is their gameenhancing card decks. These cards can help players and gamemasters alter
outcomes, inﬂuence initiative, and make dramatic scenes even more exciting. You can include one of these decks in your D6 Fantasy games with a
little tweaking. Check the West End Games Web site, www.westendgames.
com, for more information, including deck availability.

Once rounds have been declared and depending on the
situation, the gamemaster applies one of three methods
to determine in what order everyone goes. Determining
initiative does not count as an action.

Method 1
The ﬁrst method is to allow whoever makes the ﬁrst
signiﬁcant action (such as those surprising other characters
in an ambush) to act ﬁrst in the round. The characters retain
the same order until the scene ends.

Chapter 5

•

Page 50

Methods 2 & 3
The other two ways start out the same, by requiring the characters involved to make Acumen rolls to generate initiative totals. The
gamemaster makes one Acumen roll for each character or group of
characters he controls, depending on the number and how important
each character is to the adventure. The character with the highest
roll takes her action ﬁrst. The character with the second highest roll
then takes his action, and so on. After the last character performs her
action, the round ends and a new one begins. Note that a character
rendered unconscious, immobile, or otherwise unable to act loses
his action for that round if he hasn’t taken it already.
The gamemaster may chose then to have everyone roll initiative
once for the entire scene (the faster method) or roll at the beginning
of each round (the more realistic yet slower way).
The gamemaster and players may use Character Points, but not
Fate Points, to increase their initiative rolls if they want. Spending
one Character Point, for example, allows the player or gamemaster
to add the result of one extra Wild Die roll to the initiative roll.

Ties/No Rolls
In the event of ties, or if the gamemaster chooses not to have the
players roll to determine initiative, comparing attribute and skill die
codes can decide the order of actions. The character with the highest value in the characteristic goes ﬁrst, and so on. Once a character
has a spot in the order, it doesn’t change, regardless of how other
characteristics compare. Ties are broken by moving to the next factor and looking at those values. The order: (1) ability or talent that
allows the character to go ﬁrst, (2) Acumen, (3) search, (4) Agility, (5)
dodge, (6) special equipment or situation that allows the character
to go before another character.

Optional Initiative Bonus
For every 2D over the base attribute in search (round down) or
4D in Agility (round down), a character receives +1 to his initiative
roll. Every six ranks in a Skill Bonus or Increased Attribute Special
Ability that aﬀects Agility or search provides a +1 bonus.

Performing Actions in Rounds
A character does not need to declare what she intends to do until
her turn comes up in the round. Once the character decides to take her
turn, she may use as many actions as she wants, but her player must
determine the multi-action penalty for the total number of actions
that the character wishes to take in that round. The character does
not need to declare when ﬁguring the multi-action penalty what she
intends to do with all of her actions. Note that waiting counts as an
action (once per each time the character wishes to wait). The character may take no additional actions once the multi-action penalty is
ﬁgured. Any actions calculated into the multi-action penalty but that
the character did not use by the end of the round are lost.
A character may take a few actions, wait, take a few more, wait
again, and so on, as long as the player has declared a suﬃcient number
of actions in which to do everything she wants her character to do
(including waiting).
A character may only interrupt another character’s action if she
has waited and after that character has made the skill roll and spent
any points but before the gamemaster declares the result.

Example: A character surprises a pickpocket. Because she got the
jump on him, the gamemaster decides the character may act ﬁrst in
this round. The character decides to wait and see what the thief will
do, choosing to take one other action this turn. The pickpocket takes

Game Basics
a swing at her, so the character decides to dodge. If the character has
no ability that gives her extra actions, she may take only one action
without penalty. She chose to do two, so each action is at -1D. Since
her ﬁrst action was waiting, which doesn’t require a roll, the penalty
for that action is ignored. However, because dodging requires the
roll, it does get the -1D penalty.
Only a few instances exist in which the gamemaster may permit
a character to “move up” her turn and react to another character’s
actions. These include catching a thrown object, resisting certain
mental attempts, and other situations that the gamemaster deems
appropriate. These do take the character’s action, though the player
can declare that her character will perform multiple actions in the
round. For the most part, having a turn later in the round than
another’s simply means that another character could take advantage
of the situation faster.

Multi-action Penalty
Characters may attempt to perform several tasks in a single
round, or, if the action takes longer than one round to complete, in
the same minimum time period. The more they try to do, however,
the less care and concentration they can apply to each action. It
becomes more diﬃcult to succeed at all of the tasks. Thus, for most
characters, for each action taken beyond the ﬁrst, the player must
subtract 1D from all skill or attribute rolls (but not damage, damage
resistance, or initiative rolls). Thus, trying to do four actions in one
round gives the character a -3D modiﬁer to each roll. For characters
with an ability that increases their base number of actions, the
multi-action penalty doesn’t take eﬀect until the character uses up
his allotment of actions. For example, if a character with an action
allotment of eight per round wants to do nine actions, each of the
nine actions is at -1D.
Only equipment and weapons suited for quick multiple actions
may be used several times (up to the limit of their capabilities) in a
round. Items with little or no reload time, like hands or small melee
weapons, are one example of this.
A character may not rely on any skill or attribute reduced to zero.

Actions that Take Time
Each entry on this nonexhaustive list counts as one action taking
no more than ﬁve seconds to perform. The gamemaster may decide
that certain types of actions oﬀer a bonus or special eﬀect and, thus,
have requirements to perform. The suggested skill to use with each
action is included at the end of the task’s description.
Bash: Hit an opponent with a blunt weapon. (melee combat)
Catch: Stop the movement of a thrown or dropped object or
person. (The catcher must act later in the round than the person
doing the throwing or dropping. This is one of the few cases where
a character may “move up” his turn.) (throwing)
Choke: Grab a person’s neck and gripping tightly. (ﬁghting)
Communicate: Relay plans or exchange complex ideas and
information with other characters (more than a few words or one
sentence). (an interaction skill or only roleplaying)
Disarm: Remove an object from an opponent’s hand. This action
is treated as a called shot. (ﬁghting, marksmanship, melee combat,
throwing)
Dodge: Actively evade an attack. (dodge)

• Page 51

Entangle: Throw an entangling weapon at an opponent.
(throwing)
Escape: Break a hold. (lifting)
Grab: Latch onto an opponent. Depending on where the opponent
was grabbed, he can take other actions. (ﬁghting)
Kick: Strike out at an opponent with a foot. (ﬁghting)
Leap: Jump over an opponent, onto a table, or any other such
maneuver. (jumping)
Lunge: Stab forward with a pointed weapon, such as a sword or
a knife. (melee combat)
Move: Maneuver 51% of the character’s Move or more around
the area. The gamemaster should call only for a roll if the terrain is
challenging or the maneuvering complex. During some rounds, the
gamemaster may decide that existing factors dictate all movement,
regardless of length, require an action. (running, swimming)
Parry: Block an opponent’s blow. (ﬁghting, melee combat)
Pin: Trap an opponent by either holding him to the ground or
tacking a piece of his clothing to a wall or other nearby object. When
pinning the whole opponent, this is the same concept as tackling.
Pinning prevents the victim from using the fastened part. (ﬁghting,
melee combat, marksmanship, throwing)
Punch: Strike out at an opponent with a ﬁst. (ﬁghting)
Push: Forcibly move an opponent. (ﬁghting)
Ready a Weapon: Draw or reload a musket or bow, unsheathe a
knife, and similar actions. This generally does not require a skill roll,
but the gamemaster may chose to require one related to the weapon
in question for particularly stressful situations.
Run Away: Flee from the scene. (running)
Shoot: Fire a missile or projectile weapon. (marksmanship)
Slash: Swing an edged weapon. (melee combat)
Tackle: Bodily overcome an opponent. Once tackled, the opponent can do no other physical actions other than speak or attempt
to break the attacker’s grip. (ﬁghting)
Throw a Weapon or Object: Toss something at an opponent.
(throwing)
Trip: Quickly force one or both of an opponent’s legs upward.
(ﬁghting)
Use a Skill or Ability: Perform a quick action related to a Special
Ability the character possesses or a skill he wants to use. A character
may not use a Special Ability he does not have, though he may use a
skill he has no experience in (possibly at a penalty). Note that some
skills and Special Abilities take longer than one action or one round
to perform, so trying to do them in ﬁve seconds incurs penalties.
Vehicle Maneuver: Perform a stunt in a moving vehicle. (charioteering, pilotry)
Waiting: Watch for a better opportunity to perform an action.
This does not require a skill roll, but it does take concentration.

Free Actions
Free actions are anything a character can automatically perform
except under the most extreme conditions. They don’t require a
skill roll or much eﬀort. If the gamemaster thinks a task requires
concentration (and has a possibility of failure, thus requiring a skill
roll), it’s not a free action.
A few examples of free actions include:
• determining initiative

Chapter 5

•

diﬃculty by four points. This gives you a result points bonus of +2.
You apply the modiﬁer to your traps roll only, which must take place
immediately after your character’s examination of the wall.
Gamemasters also can use the related-skills guidelines for deciding
how well one person can help another person.

Preparing
A character willing to spend twice as much time to complete a task
receives a +1D bonus for the die roll for every doubling of time, up
to a maximum bonus of +3D. However, the character can do nothing else or be otherwise distracted (such as being beset by arrows
at) during this time.

Rushing
• speaking a few words to someone nearby
• a quick glance around a room (and possibly a roll of Acumen)
• moving 50% or less of the character’s Move over an easy area or
up to a meter over more challenging terrain
Additionally, the following player actions do not count as character actions:
• determining initiative
• rolling to resist damage
• rolling mettle or Charisma to determine the emotional eﬀects of
the environment on the character

Related Skills
In some situations, two or more skills may suit the task at hand.
The gamemaster can declare that only one is suitable for the current
circumstances. Or he can choose the primary one and decide which
other skills are appropriate secondary, or related, skills that the
character can use to improve his chances with the primary skill. The
gamemaster sets diﬃculties for each skill. The character ﬁrst performs
the related skills, and then he attempts the primary one.
To determine the related skill’s modiﬁer to the primary skill, the
gamemaster subtracts the diﬃculty from the total rolled with the
related skill; this determines the number of result points from the
roll. Then he divides that number by 2, rounding up, to get the modiﬁer to the total rolled with the primary skill. The minimum related
skill modiﬁer is 1. If the skill total was less than the diﬃculty, the
modiﬁer is subtracted from the primary skill total. If the skill total
was equal to or greater than the diﬃculty, the modiﬁer is added
to the primary skill total.
The character may perform the related skills and the primary skill
successively, but the related skill modiﬁer is only good for the one
initially intended attempt and the character must make that attempt
within a short time of using the other skills. Should the character
decide to perform the primary skill and the related skill at the same
time, he takes the multi-action penalty.
Example: Your character wants to carefully place a trap so that
the existing structure enhances the trap’s design. You decide that
the character ﬁrst examines the room for ideal locations (using the
search skill). Once examination has been completed and the search
roll has been made, your gamemaster lets you know that you beat the

A character can also attempt to perform an action that normally
requires two or more rounds (10 seconds or more) in less time. The
diﬃculty increases depending on how much less time the character puts
into the task: +5 for 25% less time, +10 for 50% less time, and +20 for
75% less time. A character may not perform any task in less than 25%
of the normally needed time. Thus, to rush an hour-long research of a
wizard’s library into 30 minutes, the diﬃculty increases by +10.
Of course, not every task can be rushed. If in doubt, the gamemaster should ask the player to justify how the character can speed
up the task.

Groups
To save time, gamemasters may chose to roll one action for a group
of characters he controls. Any number can belong to the group. Each
member of the group does not have to perform exactly the same
maneuver, but they do need to take similar actions. A gamemaster
could make one roll for a pack of wolves who attack diﬀerent characters, but he would have to separate the pack into those attacking
and those circling if the gamemaster wanted to have them perform
those distinctly diﬀerent activities.

Choosing Difficulties
There are two possibilities for assigning diﬃculties to a speciﬁc
action: a diﬃculty number or an opposed roll. Generally, the adventure
speciﬁes the diﬃculty and what skill is needed, but the gamemaster
may come across circumstances that were not foreseen. In such cases,
use these guidelines to decide what to do.
Certain circumstances (typically involving a character attempting a task without a force actively opposing her, such as climbing
a wall or piloting a boat) may call for a static diﬃculty number. In
these cases, select a standard diﬃculty or use a special diﬃculty.
Circumstances involving an actively opposing force call for an
opposed diﬃculty.

Standard Difficulties
A standard diﬃculty is a number that the gamemaster assigns to an
action based on how challenging the gamemaster thinks it is. Existing
conditions can change the diﬃculty of an action. For instance, walking
has an Automatic diﬃculty for most characters, but the gamemaster
may require someone who is just regaining the use of his legs to make
a Very Diﬃcult running roll to move even a few steps.

Game Basics
The numbers in parentheses indicate the
range of diﬃculty numbers for that level.
Automatic (0): Almost anyone can
perform this action; there is no need to roll.
(Generally, this diﬃculty is not listed in a pregenerated adventure; it is included here for
reference purposes.)
Very Easy (1–5): Nearly everyone can
accomplish this task. Typically, tasks with such
a low diﬃculty only are rolled when they are
crucial to the scenario.
Easy (6–10): Although characters usually
have no diﬃculty with this task, an untrained
character may ﬁnd it challenging.

Moderate (11–15): There is a fair chance

Diﬃcult (16–20): Those with little experience in the task must
have a lot of luck to accomplish this type of action.
Very Diﬃcult (21–25): The average character only rarely succeeds
at these kinds of task. Only the most talented regularly succeed.

average or highly experienced characters can accomplish them.

Opposed Difficulties
An opposed diﬃculty (also called an opposed roll) applies when
one character resists another character’s action. In this case, both
characters generate skill totals and compare them. The character with
the higher value wins, and ties go to the initiator of the action.
In an opposed task, since both characters are actively doing
something, both the initiator and the resisting character use up
actions. This means that the resisting character can only participate

in an opposed task either if he waited for the
initiating character to make a move or if he was
actively preparing for the attempt. Otherwise,
the gamemaster may allow a reaction roll of
the appropriate skill as a free action in some
circumstances, or he may derive a diﬃculty (see
the derived entry under “Special Diﬃculties”
for an example).

Special Difficulties
There are two special and optional diﬃculties: Wild Die Only and derived.

Wild Die Only: The standard diﬃculty of an
action may be so much lower than a character’s
skill value that rolling and totalling dice would
waste time. However, the gamemaster may feel
that the situation is such that a complication could greatly aﬀect the
outcome of the scene. In such cases, the game master may require
the player to roll the Wild Die. A Critical Success result indicates that
some special bit of good fortune occurred, while a Critical Failure
indicates a minor complication. Any other result shows that the
result is successful, though nothing special.
Derived: Any time one character does something to another
character or animate creature or object, the base diﬃculty equals 2
times the target’s relevant opposing attribute or skill and add the
pips. Gamemasters may further modify derived values, as the situation warrants. Derived values do not get the unskilled modiﬁer if
they are determined from the governing attribute.
Example: Your character attempts to intimidate a street urchin.
The gamemaster could use the standard intimidation diﬃculty of 10
or she could derive one from the urchin’s mettle skill, or, if he doesn’t
have one, the governing attribute, Charisma. If his Charisma has a
die code of 3D, then the base derived diﬃculty is 6.

Signiﬁcant advantage: A tool or modiﬁcation that makes the skill use much easier (rope with knots is used for
climbing).

Decisive advantage: A tool speciﬁcally designed to make the job easier (a well-stocked set of herbs and bandages for
healing).

-16 or more

Overwhelming advantage: An exceptional tool or modiﬁcation that speciﬁcally makes the skill use much easier (complete
set of wilderness tools and equipment specially designed to help with survival).

Chapter 5

Generic Modifiers
The modiﬁers oﬀered in a skill’s list or a pregenerated adventure
may not cover all the gamemaster’s needs. When conditions arise for
which there aren’t pre-established modiﬁers, use the chart herein to
help at those times. Gamemasters can add these modiﬁers to opposed,
standard, or derived diﬃculty values.

Good Roleplaying Modifier
Gamemasters should reward good roleplaying by lowering the
diﬃculty a few points. The better the roleplaying — and the more
entertaining the player makes the scenario — the higher the modiﬁer
the gamemaster should include.

Unskilled Attempts
Remember that someone without training or experience might,
with blind luck, do better than someone with experience — but
generally only that one time. There is no guarantee of future success. When a character defaults to the attribute, ﬁgure in not only
a diﬃculty modiﬁer of +1, +5, or more, but also adjust the result
accordingly; the result won’t happen as precisely or stylishly as
someone with skill.

Determining Success
If the total rolled on the dice is greater than the diﬃculty, the
attempt was a success. Ties generally go to the initiator of the action,
but certain circumstances dictate otherwise (such as the use of some
Special Abilities or determining the amount of damage done). The
description of the ability, challenge, or activity explains the results.

Result Points
Result points refer to the diﬀerence between the skill roll and the
diﬃculty. The gamemaster can use the result points to decide how
well the character completed the task. The gamemaster may allow a
player to add one-half of the result points (rounded up) as a bonus
to another skill roll or Extranormal or Special Ability eﬀect. One-ﬁfth
of the result points from an attack roll can be included as bonus to
damage. (Round fractions up.)

Second Chances
As characters tackle obstacles, they’ll ﬁnd ones that they can’t
overcome initially. Gamemasters must rely on their judgment to decide
whether and when a character may try an action again. For some
actions, such as marksmanship or running, the character may try the
action again the next turn, even if she failed. For other actions, such
as crafting or bluﬀ, failing the roll should have serious consequences,
depending on how bad the failure was. A small diﬀerence between
the diﬃculty number and the success total means the character may
try again next round at a higher diﬃculty. A large diﬀerence means
that the character has made the situation signiﬁcantly worse. She
will need to spend more time thinking through the problem or ﬁnd
someone or something to assist her in her endeavor. A large diﬀerence plus a Critical Failure could mean that the character has created
a disaster. She can’t try that speciﬁc task for a long time — perhaps
ever. This is especially true with locks and some devices.

•

Page 54

Result Points & Success
Here are some guidelines for describing diﬀerent levels of success. Use the result points of the roll — the diﬀerence between
the skill total and the diﬃculty — to decide on the exact level.
Minimal (0): The total was just barely enough. The character
hardly succeeded at all, and only the most minimal eﬀects apply.
If “minimal eﬀects” are not an option, then maybe the action
took longer than normal to succeed.
Solid (1–4): The action was performed completely, but
without frills.
Good (5–8): The results were better than necessary and
there may be added beneﬁts.
Superior (9–12): There are almost certainly additional
beneﬁts to doing an action this well. The character performed
the action better, faster, or more adeptly than expected.
Spectacular (13–16): The character performed the action
deftly and expertly. Observers would notice the ease or grace
with which the action was performed (if applicable).
Incredible (17 or more): The character performed the skill
with such dazzling quality that, if appropriate to the task, it could
become the subject of conversation for some time — it’s at least
worth writing home about. Gamemasters should dole out some
signiﬁcant bonuses for getting this large of a roll.
Example: A character who trying to use the survival skill to
forage for food gets a minimal success — she ﬁnds “subsistence
level” food; it’s barely better than garbage. The next day she gets
a spectacular result — not only does she locate good, wholesome
food, but she ﬁnds enough for two days instead of one.

Gamemaster’s Fiat
The rules are a framework upon which the gamemasters and their
friends build stories set in fantastic and dynamic worlds. As with
most frameworks, the rules work best when they show the least, and
when they can bend under stress. Keeping to the letter of the rules is
almost certainly counterproductive to the whole idea of making an
engaging story and having fun. To keep a story ﬂowing with a nice
dramatic beat, gamemasters might need to bend the rules, such as
reducing the signiﬁcance of a modiﬁer in this situation but not in
another one, or allowing a character to travel a meter or two beyond
what the movement rules suggest.

Common Difficulties &
Modifiers
You can ﬁnd the more commonly referenced diﬃculties listed
on the Reference Sheet at the back of this book. With these plus the
generic diﬃculties and modiﬁers described previously, you can run
just about any adventure. The next several chapters include more,
and more detailed, diﬃculties.

CHAPTER VI

• Movement •
What’s in this Chapter
Getting from here to there by any means – running, swimming, ﬂying, using a vehicle, you name it – is what this chapter’s all about.

Running
The diﬃculty to cover rapidly a distance on foot is determined by
the number of extra movements the character takes. One movement
equals the character’s Move value; two movements equals twice the
Move value, and so on. For each movement beyond the ﬁrst, add 5
to the base diﬃculty of zero.
Example: A character with a Move of 10 who wants to move 20
meters in one round has a running diﬃculty of 5, while a character
who wants to move 40 meters has a diﬃculty of 15.
A character who fails his running roll in the ﬁrst round covers
only his Move or may even trip, depending on how badly the player
missed the roll. See the “Accelerating and Decelerating” section for
details on what happens in subsequent rounds.

Swimming
A hero’s swimming Move equals half his normal Move (rounded
up). One movement while swimming equals the swimming Move,
two movements equals twice the swimming Move, and so on. Increasing this rate likewise increases the base diﬃculty of 5 by +5 for each
movement beyond the ﬁrst. Thus, the diﬃculty for a character to
move 2 times his swimming speed is 10 (5 for the base diﬃculty plus
5 for the additional movement).
Without preparation, a character may hold his breath for a number
of seconds equal to 5 times a roll of his Physique or stamina. Preoxygenating his lungs gives a character a bonus. The maximum any
character can hold his breath with preparation is 10 times a roll of
his stamina in seconds, though this requires having the stamina skill.
The bonus should be much less for the average person.
A character who fails his swimming roll begins to drown, taking 1D
in damage each round that he misses his roll. Furthermore, diﬃculty to
remain aﬂoat increases by +3 for each round that the character misses
the roll. The damage total and the swimming modiﬁer are cumulative
and the failed rounds need not be consecutive (though they must be
within the same period of time spent in the water).

Climbing
Characters who have the climbing skill can move up a surface at
their normal Move (barring adverse environmental factors) with a base
diﬃculty of 5. Those without such a skill move at half their normal
movement rate. Increasing the rate increases the diﬃculty by +10 for
each additional one-half of the base climbing Move (rounded up).

Example: A character with a running Move of 10 and
without the climbing
skill wants to move
quickly up a tree.
His base climbing
Move is 5. To increase
this to eight meters
per round means a
diﬃculty of 20 (5 to
climb the tree plus
+10 to increase the
movement by onehalf, or three meters,
of his base climbing
Move).
Additional modiﬁers can be found in
the “Example Skill
Diﬃculties” chapter.

Jumping
A character’s total
leaping distance (vertically and horizontally) from a standing
position equals onequarter of his Move in
meters (rounded up).
The base diﬃculty is 5
to move this distance,
and +10 for each additional two meters
(vertically and horizontally) the character hopes to cover. If
there is enough room,
the character may
try running before
jumping. The character may add 5 to his skill total per round of the
running start, up to a maximum of +10 (two rounds). The character
must have beat the running diﬃculty in both rounds in order to get
the full bonus.
Additional modiﬁers can be found in the “Example Skill Diﬃculties” chapter.

smooth surface, complete darkness)

Very hazardous terrain (corridor ﬁlled with falling
debris and explosions, swimming or ﬂying in

+25 or more

Flying Characters
Characters who ﬂy do so at the base rate designated in the Special
Ability, spell, miracle, or equipment description. To increase this rate,
use the same rules as for running, except that the character relies on
the ﬂying skill. Characters may not use this skill unless they have a
means of propelling themselves through the air.
See the “Vehicles and Aerial Characters” section later in this
chapter for more details on ﬂying movement.

Short Distances
A character may move up to 50% of his movement rate (swimming, ﬂying, or base Move) without this counting as an action. Thus,
a character with a base Move of 10 could move ﬁve meters on land
or 2.5 meters in the water with no action penalty.

Maximum Movement
Characters may perform only one movement action of each type
per round, unless a Special Ability allows them to do otherwise.
Gamemasters may choose to limit the speed at which characters
may travel to 4 times the Move rate for each type of movement.

Accelerating & Decelerating
When it becomes important to the scenario, such as a race or a
chase scene, the gamemaster may choose to include acceleration and
deceleration maximums.
A character may increase or decrease his current movement rate
by up to 2 times that rate, regardless of whether his movement roll
would allow him to travel a greater distance. The maximum increase
or decrease is 2 times the character’s base Move for that type of
movement.

Example: A character with a base walking Move of 10 has
a maximum swimming change of 10 — 2 times his swimming
Move of 5.
Example: A character with a Move of 10 is chasing a thief,
who just swiped his coin bag. In the ﬁrst round, he may move
up to 20 meters, which has a running diﬃculty of 5. In the second round, he can increase his speed to 40 meters, which has
a running diﬃculty of 15. If, in the second round, the player
generates a running total of 20, by the acceleration rules, he may
only move 40 meters, even though his running total meets the
diﬃculty to move 50 meters.
Similarly, if a character does not make a movement roll that
would allow him to move at the previous round’s rate, that
character automatically slows by 2 times his base Move. In
other words, subtract 2 times the base Move from the current
movement rate to get the new movement rate. If this makes
the current movement zero, then the character stops. If it’s less
than zero, the character trips.
Example: The character chasing the thief increased his
speed to a rate of 40 meters per round. To maintain this speed,
his player needs to continue generating a total of 15 with the
character’s running skill. If the player gets less than 15, then
his character’s speed drops to 20 meters per round (40 minus
2 times her base Move of 10).

Fatigue
Keep in mind that most characters cannot move rapidly for long
periods of time. Determine a suitable length of time depending on
existing conditions, the Physique of the character, and any relevant
Special Abilities she has. Any additional fast movement beyond
that predetermined length requires a fatigue modiﬁer of +3 to the
diﬃculty for each additional round that she continues running. The
modiﬁer is cumulative. Thus, one round beyond the maximum is +3,
two rounds is +6, and so on.
The gamemaster may use the fatigue modiﬁer for any repetitive
action performed for an extended period of time. They can also use it
as the modiﬁer to a base diﬃculty of 5 when using the stamina
or mettle skill in an attempt to overcome the fatigue.

Other Movement
Options
The gamemaster may include additional modiﬁers
or require an additional related skill roll for any form
of movement, depending on surrounding conditions,
such as high winds, numerous obstacles, slick surfaces, sharp turns, and so on.

Vehicles & Aerial
Characters
Vehicle actions work like normal
character actions, with some
additional game mechanics
for special situations.

Movement
Much of the information found in this section applies equally
well to ﬂying characters and creatures, particularly the details
on stunts.

Vehicle Movement
Vehicles, including those pulled by animals, have ﬁve speeds
of movement: stopped, cautious, cruising, high, and all-out.
Drivers and pilots of vehicles may make one movement action
per round.
• Stopped: The vehicle is motionless. This requires no roll.
• Cautious: The vehicle travels at half its Move. This is generally
a free action requiring no roll, but terrain conditions may increase
it from its base diﬃculty of zero.
• Cruising: The vehicle travels at its Move. This requires an
action, but since it has a base diﬃculty of zero, the character need
only roll if movement conditions dictate otherwise.
• High: The vehicle travels at twice its Move. This requires a
charioteering or pilotry roll with a base diﬃculty of 5, modiﬁed by
existing conditions.
• All-out: The vehicle travels at four times its Move. This
requires a charioteering or pilotry roll with a base diﬃculty of 10,
modiﬁed by existing conditions.
Vehicles may travel anywhere between half their current speed
and the full current speed at each level. Rapid acceleration and
deceleration are considered stunts and dealt in the next section.
Use the running rules earlier in this chapter to determine the
rate at which creatures pulling the vehicle travel. Each vehicle lists
the pulling rate for the animal while attached to it.

Stunts
For normal vehicle use or casual ﬂying under ideal conditions,
a character need not make a skill roll. When the conditions turn
less than favorable or he decides to attempt a fancy maneuver,
his charioteering or pilotry skill plus the vehicle’s Maneuverability
code or his ﬂying skill determines his success. A character’s animal
handling roll may help (or hinder!) the operation of vehicles pulled
by creatures.
Rapid acceleration and deceleration also warrant rolls, enhanced
by the vehicle’s Maneuverability, to see if the operator maintains
control. These maneuvers have an initial diﬃculty equal to the
speed at which the vehicle is traveling, adjusted based on existing
conditions (see the “Stunt Diﬃculties and Modiﬁers” chart for
some suggestions). A vehicle may reduce or increase movement by
two levels in one round. Failing this roll means that the character
has lost control for one round. If some immovable force doesn’t
stop the vehicle or character during that round, he may attempt
to regain control on the following round.
Captains in charged of crews need to make periodic command
rolls. (See the command entry on page 76 for diﬃculty suggestions.)
Based on the diﬀerence between the diﬃculty and the roll, the
crew might help or hinder the pilot’s eﬀorts — and perhaps even
that of the gunners!
For land vehicles, if the character fails the charioteering roll, the
vehicle misses its target, veers to the side, and stops — perhaps
even loses its pulling creatures or topples over if the roll was bad
enough. If the vehicle can still move, the character must then

charioteering or pilotry skill at all, these diﬃculties are in addition
to the untrained modiﬁer.

spend one round regaining control of the animals and another in
getting the vehicle back where she wants it. Should the character
instead succeed, she keeps the vehicle reasonably straight and may
try for another stunt on the next turn.
If a character wishes to perform any other actions in addition to
charioteering. pilotry, or ﬂying, he must make the appropriate skill
rolls for all actions, reduced by the multi-action penalty, regardless
of the situation. The base diﬃculty for normal operation becomes 5.
Stunts still have their established base diﬃculties.

Ramming & Sideswiping Vehicles
Ramming is done with the nose of a vehicle, while sideswiping is
done with its side. Only water vehicles or magical conveyances not
requiring animals to pull it may ram. Any vehicle may sideswipe.
The pilot of a water vehicle that rams another vehicle automatically
loses all actions the next round, trying to keep the boat from tipping
or spinning. About the best she can hope for is to limp back to land.
Both vehicles take damage (the mechanics of this are explained
later in this section) in a successful ram or sideswipe.

Targeting the Creatures
If the creature pulling a vehicle is incapacitated or killed, the
vehicle is considered to crash at its current speed. (This is also the
case if only one creature in a team is killed or incapacitated.) The game
characteristics for a typical horse are given on page 126.

• Page 58

Rather than killing the creatures or creatures, an attacker might try
to “spook” it or them. All but the best-trained horses will be spooked
by explosions or ﬁre. To spook a creature, a character must have the
means at hand to create such an eﬀect (such as a ﬂintlock pistol or
a mystic bolt spell), and must generate an intimidation total against
the creature’s mettle or Charisma. If the intimidation total meets or
beats the creature’s total, the eﬀect spooks the creature.
With a scared creature, the driver of the vehicle must generate a
charioteering or pilotry total (including the Maneuverability) against
a diﬃculty equal to the animal’s mettle or Charisma total +9 to bring
it under control. If the driver fails, the creature gallops away at top
speed, towing the vehicle behind it. If the creature is a member of a
team, the entire team panics and gallops oﬀ. The creature and carriage
travel at “panic speed,” a rate equal to 4 times the creature’s Move.
Each round, the driver can make another charioteering or pilotry
roll to gain control of the creature or creatures. For each round that
the vehicle is traveling at panic speed, it suﬀers damage as if it had
been hit by an attack (equal to 5D on a road or smooth surface,
6D when on rough ground). Obviously, a panicked team can easily
destroy a carriage.

Vehicle Attacking & Dodging

The base diﬃculty to hit a vehicle is 10, modiﬁed by distance and
the sizes of the attacker and the defender (using the scale modiﬁer
listed in the “Combat Options” chapter). That means a person shooting
a large carriage has a +6 to his attack
total, while a carriage sideswiping
another carriage has no modiﬁer.

Vehicle Damage

When a vehicle takes damage from
a weapon or another vehicle, it’s the
level of destruction that matters. For
this reason, vehicles simply use a dam-

Movement
age level system (similar to Wounds), rather than having Body Points.
Use the following guidelines and compare the result to the “Vehicle
& Passenger Damage” chart to ﬁgure out the level of damage the
vehicle has sustained. (Injury to creatures is determined separately
and using the same rules as characters.)
A vehicle’s damage resistance total equals its Toughness plus
the value of any armor. Character Points or Fate Points may not be
spent on this roll.
With weapons, compare the weapon’s damage total to the target’s
damage resistance total.
Modify the damage total of the attacker or the damage resistance total of the target by the scale modiﬁer, as appropriate for
the situation.
When a vehicle collides with something else, decide how fast it
was going when it made the collision and modify it based on the circumstances of the collision. Compare that to the damage resistance
total. Should two vehicles be involved, both take damage. See the
sidebar for the speed and collision modiﬁers.
Note that destroying a vehicle does not necessarily immobilize
the creatures pulling it. Creatures well integrated are trapped, while
those hitched with a couple of rods in front simply end up pulling
that part of the vehicle away.

Crew & Passenger Injuries
Depending on how badly damaged the vehicle becomes, the crew
and passengers may be harmed, too. Use the “Passengers Suﬀer” column of the “Vehicle & Passenger Damage” chart as a guideline. Adjust
it based on how much the passengers are exposed (for example, open
wagons and canoes oﬀer little protection to their cargo).

Very Light: The vehicle’s Maneuverability drops by 1D for this round and the
next.
Light: Either the vehicle’s Maneuverability drops by 1D, or top Move speed is
decreased by one level. The drop or modiﬁer remains until repaired.
Heavy: Either the vehicle’s Maneuverability drops by 2D, or top Move speed is
decreased by two levels. The loss or modiﬁer remains until repaired.
Severe: The vehicle is out of control, decelerating by two levels each round until
it comes to a stop or crashes into something.
Destroyed: The vehicle will never operate again.

Repairing a Vehicle
The diﬃculty to repair a damaged vehicle
depends on the amount of damage and availability
of parts and tools. See the crafting skill description
in the “Example Skill Diﬃculties” chapter for difﬁculty and modiﬁer suggestions.

Sample Vehicles
See the “Equipment” chapter for sample land
and water vehicles, their costs, and their game
characteristics.

CHAPTER VII

• Combat •
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter provides an extended description of one of the most
rules-intensive aspects of roleplaying: combat.
When resolving a situation calls for force, time becomes broken
into rounds, which were discussed in the “Rounds and Initiative”
section of the “Game Basics” chapter. Within these rounds, three
steps occur: (1) generating initiative; (2) attacking and defending; (3)
determining damage; (4) repeating the steps, if necessary. Discover
herein what happens in each of those steps.

Step 1: Generating Initiative
As discussed in the “Game Basics” chapter, determine initiative
based on the ﬁrst signiﬁcant action or on initiative rolls. Then go on
to Step 2.

Step 2: Attacking &
Defending
This is where the interesting stuﬀ happens. The person whose
turn it is gets to decide what type of action her character is going to
do. Once she chooses, she makes a skill roll.
Note that a character need not attempt to engage in combat, but
this chapter only discusses what to do if the player decides to attack,
defend, or do both (typically with a multi-action penalty).

Base Combat Difficulty
The base diﬃculty to attack someone is 10 (called the target’s
passive defense value) or the target’s active defense value, modiﬁed
by range and other factors.

Active Defense
The target character can opt to use an “active defense,” which
aﬀects all attacks that occur after the defender’s turn in the current
round but before the defender’s turn the next round. Active defenses
are defensive maneuvers that the target consciously exercises, such
as dodging, blocking, or parrying. Each of these is represented by a
skill and counts as an action.
A character may make an active defense only when his turn comes
up in the initiative line, but the total for the roll is eﬀective for all
relevant attacks made against the character that occur after the
character’s current turn but before his turn in the next round.
Remember: If a character acts later in a round than the character
attempting to hit him, he cannot take his turn sooner and use an
active defense to replace the passive defense value — his reactions
just weren’t fast enough.

If the roll is lower than the passive defense value, the character
has succeeded in making himself easier to hit — by miscalculating
where the attack would be placed and actually getting in its way.
The active defense total is modiﬁed as the situation dictates.
Dodge: The character attempts to anticipate the ﬁnal location of
an attack from any source and be in another place when it comes.
This is done by rolling the dodge skill.
Block/Parry: The character attempts to stop his opponent’s attack
by intercepting it and either stopping it with a block or deﬂecting it
with a parry. The character may roll his ﬁghting or melee combat (if he
has something in his hands) to block it. If the character uses a sharp
weapon (sword or dagger, for example) to parry an unarmed blow and
is successful at the block, the attacker takes damage from the weapon.
However, do not add the defender’s Physique to the listed weapon
damage score when determining injuries inﬂicted this way.
If the opponent strikes at the character with a bladed hand weapon
and the character uses any part of his body to intercept the attack,
the defender always takes the weapon’s damage total. If the block
was successful, then the attacker’s Strength Damage is not added
to the listed score. If the block was unsuccessful, then the target
character takes damage as normal. The character may avoid this
aspect by having armor, a special ability, or a suitable close combat
specialization in melee parry.

Full Defense
A character who foregoes all of her actions for a round to completely protect herself from attacks makes a full defense. The total
rolled by the skill plus 10 takes the place of the base combat diﬃculty
from the time the character makes the full defense on her turn to
her turn in the next round.
Full active defense value = any active defense skill roll + 10

Vehicle Combat
When characters use vehicles, the basic combat rules are
the same; the diﬀerence exists in which skill to use. Vehicles
cannot block or parry. The driver may only make defensive
maneuvers (“dodge”); he uses his charioteering or pilotry plus
the vehicle’s Maneuverability rating to determine the new
combat diﬃculty. Ramming or sideswiping with a vehicle
requires the driver to make a charioteering or pilotry roll (see
the “Vehicles and Aerial Characters” section of the “Movement” chapter for details).

Combat

Partial Defense
A character who chooses to do something else in addition to
guarding against attacks may take a partial defense. In this case,
the active defense roll replaces the base combat diﬃculty from the
time the character takes his turn in one round to his turn in the
next round. This total replaces the base combat diﬃculty even if the
result is less than 10.
Partial active defense value = any active defense skill roll
Since the character is taking multiple actions, the multi-action
penalty applies.
The gamemaster may call for a partial defense roll (as a free action)
if he decides that the character might have a little awareness of an
impending attack, yet not enough foresight to prepare for it.

Optional Passive Defense Modifier
For every 2D in Agility or dodge above 4D (round up), a character
receives a +1 to her passive defense value. This modiﬁer does not aﬀect the character’s active defense
total. Every six ranks in a Skill Bonus or Increased
Attribute Special Ability that aﬀects Agility or dodge
provides a +1 bonus, as speciﬁed for the skill in

targets, but they cannot themselves do anything else in the round
in which they aim. Each consecutive round of uninterrupted aiming
adds 1D to the character’s marksmanship or throwing skill, up to a
maximum bonus of +3D.

Determining Success
Once the combat diﬃculty has been determined, the attacker rolls
the die code in his character’s combat skill and compares the total
to the combat diﬃculty. If it equals or exceeds the combat diﬃculty,
the attack hits, probably doing damage or having another eﬀect that
the attacker intended. If it was less than the combat diﬃculty, then
the attack misses.

Step 3: Determining Damage
If a character successfully hits his target, he may have done damage
to it. To determine the amount of injury caused, roll the damage die

Common Combat Difficulty Modifiers

Example: A character with 4D in Agility gets
no bonus, while a character with 7D in acrobatics
has a +2 bonus.

Combat Difficulty Modifiers
Here are a few of the most frequently used
modiﬁers to the combat diﬃculty. Others are discussed in “Combat Options” chapter. Regardless
of the number of modiﬁers used, the total combat
diﬃculty may never go below 3.
The gamemaster rolls the indicated modiﬁer and
adds it to the combat situation. A standard modiﬁer
is included in parentheses after the die modiﬁer,
should the gamemaster prefer not to roll.
Range: The eﬀectiveness of a punch, weapon,
Special Ability, or any other attack made at a distance depends on its range. All range modiﬁers are
added or subtracted from the combat diﬃculty.
Note that, unless a special maneuver allows otherwise, characters may use unarmed close combat
attacks at Point Blank range only. In most cases,
this is true for using various melee weapons as well,
though the distance can be increased to Short range
if the weapon is longer than two meters. For instance,
a character with a long wooden plank can whack an
opponent at Point Blank or Short range.
Cover: When a target is protected by something
— poor lighting, smoke, fog, a table — it makes her
harder to hit. This is represented by a cover modiﬁer,
which is added to the combat diﬃculty.
Aiming: Aiming involves careful tracking of the
target. Characters may perform it against moving

Estimating Ranges
Gamemasters who aren’t interested in looking up weapon ranges and ﬁguring out the distance to the target can estimate what modiﬁers to use with these
guidelines.
 A target within a few steps of the attacker is a Point Blank range.
 An attacker ﬁring a long bow at a target across a large chamber shoots at Short
range, while an attacker throws a knife at the same target at Medium range.
 Most projectile combat taking place outdoors is at Medium to Long range.

*If cover oﬀers protection, the attacker cannot hit the target directly, but damage
done to the cover might exceed the Armor Value it provides, and, indirectly, damage
the target. Most of the time, the attacker must eliminate the cover before having a
chance to hit the target.

Chapter 7
code for the weapon, including any modiﬁers from a special combat
action, such as a sweep attack or hit location. Some weapons list their
score as a die code with a plus sign (“+”) in front of it; in this case, add
the damage die code to the attacker’s Strength Damage die code, add
modiﬁers, and roll. If the gamemaster chooses to use the optional
damage bonus, this is added to the total at this time.
After the player or the gamemaster has ﬁgured out how much
damage is done, go to the “Damage” chapter to determine how much
of that damage the target sustained.

Determining Strength Damage
To ﬁgure the Strength Damage die code, drop the pips from the
character’s Physique or lifting die code (but include any relevant Disadvantages or Special Abilities), divide the number by 2, and round up.
The Increased Attribute: Physique Special Ability aﬀects the total.

Optional Damage Bonus
The combat skill roll is supposed to reﬂect the accuracy of an
attack. Therefore, gamemasters may reward high rolls for players’
characters and signiﬁcant gamemaster characters with a bonus to
damage. Subtract the diﬃculty of the successful attack from the
skill total and divide this number by 5, rounding up. Add this damage bonus to the damage total before comparing it to the resistance
total. If the gamemaster uses the damage bonus in combination with
a called-shot hit location, the bonus is in addition to the damage
modiﬁer except for attempts on an arm, leg, or hand. In those cases,
ignore the damage bonus.
For Special Abilities and Extranormal skills that require a combat
roll to target them, the gamemaster may allow the combat roll’s
damage bonus to apply to the ability’s roll.

Step 4: Repeat
If the ﬁght isn’t ﬁnished after one round, then return to Step
1 in the “Combat” chapter and do it all over again. Repeat
these steps until the ﬁght is resolved in favor of one side
or the other.

Combat Summary
You can ﬁnd a summary of the information in this chapter
on the Reference Sheet included in the back of this book.

Combat Example
To give you an idea of how all this works, here’s a typical
exchange between a player’s character and one of her opponents.
Gamemaster: Okay, we’re in combat rounds now. Everyone make a Acumen roll. (All players and the gamemaster roll
their dice.) Anyone roll higher than 20?
Cian: Yeah, I rolled a 23!
Gamemaster: All right, what do you want to do?
Cian: Ah, that depends. What’re the goblins doing?
Gamemaster: As one runs across the street towards
you, another levels his crossbow at you, and a third grabs
a villager.

• Page 62

Cian: I’m going to take two actions. First, I’ll shoot at one of
the goblins with my crossbow, and then I’m going to dodge out of
the way.
Gamemaster: Okay, you lose 1D from each action and you don’t
get the full defense bonus, since you’re taking two actions.
Cian: (Rolls her character’s marksmanship dice.) I rolled a 6 on the
Wild Die! (Rolls the Wild Die again.) All right, that’s a total of 21!
Gamemaster: You nailed him! Roll damage.
Cian: (Rolls her crossbow’s damage dice.) I rolled an 18.
Gamemaster: (Using the Wounds system, he rolls the goblin’s
Physique to resist the damage.) Whoops! I rolled a 1 on the Wild Die.
That leaves a total of 2. Well, that’s 16 points over the resistance
total,. The optional damage bonus adds +2 and brings the total to
18. This deﬁnitely puts him at the Dead level! Your crossbow bolt
catches him right in the chest and he’s thrown backward, landing
with a fail of limbs in the dirt. Okay, now make your dodge roll. (Note
that if the gamemaster had decided to use the Body Points system, the
merc would not have made a resistance roll, instead taking the full 18
points of damage.)
Cian: (Rolls her character’s dodge dice.) Well, I rolled a 13, but
something tell’s me that’s not going to be high enough, so I’m going
to spend a Character Point.
Gamemaster: Okay, roll another die and add it.
Cian: (Rolls one more die.) I rolled a 5, so that’s a total of 18. I’ll
stick with that.
Gamemaster: Okay, the goblins get to go now. The one readying
his crossbow ﬁres. (Checks range and then rolls the merc’s marksmanship dice.) That’s a 17.
Cian: I rolled an 18 for my dodge this round. Good thing I spent
that Character Point!
Gamemaster: That’s right, so the goblin’s bolt lanced straight
toward you and you just barely manage to jump out of the way. On
to the next one ...

CHAPTER VIII

• Damage •
What’s in this Chapter
Injury can come from all sides. This chapter describes two methods
of ﬁguring out how hurt a character is, plus a few sources of damage
other than weapons.

Body Points versus
Wound Levels
The Body Points system has the advantage of a gradual fall into
death and a more rapid healing process. The Wound levels system
brings it on faster and is slower to heal. Which the gamemaster
chooses to use depends on how deadly he wants the game.
Furthermore, gamemasters should feel free further adjust the
deadliness of their games by giving characters more or less Body
Points or Wound levels, by adding a modiﬁer to the damage resistance
total, or by adjusting the eﬀects of each Wound level.

Damage & Body Points
Once the player or gamemaster has her character’s resistance
total, subtract the attacker’s damage total from the target’s damage
resistance total and subtract that number from the total Body Points
the character has remaining. If the gamemaster chooses, she may
compare the number of Body Points the character has remaining to
the “Wound Level” table to determine what level of injury the defender
sustained and what its eﬀects on the character are.
If the damage resistance total is greater than or equal to the damage
total, the defender incurs no injuries (beyond an annoying bruise, a
shallow scrape, a light burn, or dinged protective gear).

Damage Resistance Total
The damage resistance total equals a roll of the target character’s
die codes from armor or Special Abilities (such as Attack Resistance)
minus any modiﬁers from disease, ingested poisons, or other debilitating circumstances (such as an appropriate Hindrance). A player
may improve his character’s resistance total by spending Character

Miscellaneous Damage
Here is a small selection of various other harmful things
that players may encounter during their adventures. Generally, no attack roll is necessary for any of these to aﬀect a
character, though such a roll would be required if a person
could somehow attack with it. The gamemaster determines
what, if any, beneﬁt armor and similar protection provides.
Some equipment may even increase the damage! Damage is
otherwise determined as per the combat rules.
Except falling, all damage is done per round of close contact. The gamemaster may decide that certain types in certain
situations also aﬀect characters at a distance.

Botulism (severe case)
4D
Cold (extreme)
1D

Points or a Fate Point on this roll.
If the character has no armor or Special Abilities, then the character
has a damage resistance total of zero, and the player makes no roll.
However, he can still spend Character Points, using them as a base
damage resistance total. Spending a Fate Point allows the player to
roll his character’s Physique. Totals determined from spending points
are adjusted as normal, including negative and positive damage
resistance modiﬁers.

Stun Damage

For weapons that do stun damage, after the damage total is
determined but before applying it, subtract a roll of
the target’s Physique or stamina from the damage total.
If the victim suﬀers at least one point of damage, that
character goes unconscious for a number of minutes
To reﬂect the average nonplayer character’s relative unimportance to the
equal to the diﬀerence between the resistance total and
universe, gamemasters may wish to lower the gamemaster character’s Body
the original damage total.
Points or Wounds. For pure cannon fodder any damage over a roll of their
Physique might cause them to keel over, while the main villain and her most
important henchwomen should get the full complement.

total on the “Wound Level” table to determine how much injury the
defender sustained and what its eﬀects on the character are.
If the damage resistance total is greater than or equal to the damage
total, the defender incurs no injuries (beyond an annoying bruise, a
shallow scrape, a light burn, or dinged protective gear).

Damage Resistance Total
The resistance total equals the target character’s Physique plus any
bonuses from armor or Special Abilities (such as Increased
Attribute: Physique) minus any modiﬁers from disease,
ingested poisons, or other debilitating circumstances (such as
an appropriate Hindrance). Do not include any Wound level
modiﬁer when attempting to resist damage. A character also
may improve her resistance by spending Character Points or
a Fate Point on this roll.

tive terms? It depends on what caused the harm. The following list
supplies some general guidelines for describing what might have
happened to the character’s body when he was hurt. Use the “Wound
Levels” chart to decide on the character’s current Wound level.
Stunned: Moderate bruise or minor sprain; laceration; muscle
tear; minor dislocation of joint.
Wounded: Severe abrasion or sprain; deep laceration; torn ligaments; major dislocation or minor break.

Wound Levels

Stun Damage
For weapons that do stun damage, after the number of
Wounds have been determined but before applying the level
modiﬁers, reduce the weapon’s damage by two Wound levels,
with a minimum level of Stunned. The character also goes
unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the diﬀerence
between the resistance total and the damage total.

Unconsciousness & Death
If the character’s Body Points reach a few points or he
has attained the Mortally Wounded level but the character
wasn’t instantly killed by massive damage, he is still gravely
injured and falls unconscious. Every round that he is at this
level, his player makes a Physique roll against a diﬃculty equal
to the number of minutes the character has been Mortally
Wounded.
Suﬃcient medical aid to bring the character to at least 10%
of his maximum Body Points or restore one Wound level can
possibly rescue the imperiled character. If suitable medical aid
is administered within four minutes, the character recovers
without undue harm. If the medical aid is given within four
to 10 minutes, the player rolls his character’s Physique or
stamina against a diﬃculty equal to the number of minutes
he was Mortally Wounded. If the roll succeeds, the character
revives but he loses 1D from all of his skills, though the skill
cannot go below the attribute’s die code. If the medical aid is
given within 10 to 15 minutes, the player rolls his character’s
Physique or stamina against a diﬃculty equal to the number of
minutes he was Mortally Wounded. If the roll succeeds, the
character revives but he loses 2D from all of his skills, though
no skill can be reduced below the attribute’s die code. In any
case, should the roll fail, the character dies.
Characters who receive their total Body Points in additional
damage after reaching zero Body Points cannot be revived (by
normal means, anyway).

of Wound levels — so what? What does that mean in descrip-

*Note: Any additional damage less than or equal to the character’s
current level moves the character up by one level.
**A character moves to the Severely Wounded level if the diﬀerence is
between 4 and 8 and she already has the Wounded level.
†Note: This is an optional chart for use with Body Points. The “Body Points
Left” column is based on the character’s maximum Body Points. Round up
or down so that no overlap exists between levels.
Penalties imposed by each level are not cumulative; do not include them
when determining the stun or damage resistance total or any total not
involving a skill or attribute.
Bruised: Character’s toughness absorbed most or all of the attack.
However, the gamemaster may decide that a result that misses by a few
points against a defender with no protection (natural other otherwise)
instead inﬂicts a Stunned level.
Stunned: Character either gets -1D for all remaining actions this round
and next round or may only defend or retreat in the next round.
Wounded: Character is at -1D to all actions until healed.
Severely Wounded: Character is at -2D on all actions until healed.
Incapacitated: As a free action before losing consciousness, the
character may try to stay up with a Moderate (15) stamina or mettle
roll. If he succeeds, he may continue to act, but all actions have a -3D
penalty. If he fails, he is knocked out for 10D minutes.
Mortally Wounded: The character is near death and knocked
unconscious with no chance to keep up. Roll the character’s Physique
each round, the character ﬁnally dies if the roll is less than the number
of minutes he’s been at this level.
Dead: The character has perished.
Fast Combat Option: Gamemasters who wish to give the players’
characters and their major opponents an edge in battles, make the
game more realistic, or simply save themselves trouble should apply
the modiﬁers in the ﬁrst round of combat and then reassess the levels
after combat is complete.

Damage
Severely Wounded: Broken bone; gaping wound; ripped cartilage
and muscle; concussion.
Incapacitated: Multiple fracture; laceration in vital area; heavy
concussion.
Mortally Wounded: Above options combined with multiple
internal injuries.
Dead: Broken neck; punctured lung; eviscerated.
These are just a few examples. Really interested gamemasters
can come up with charts, tables, or detailed descriptions of damage
for those players who absolutely must know. The gamemaster may
also assign diﬀerent modiﬁers than the general ones listed in the
“Wound Levels” sidebar that more appropriately indicate the type
of injury that was suﬀered.

Negative Damage
Resistance Total
It is possible for the damage resistance total to be a negative
number. Spell feedback, poisons, sickness, and Disadvantages can all
contribute negative modiﬁers that might take the damage resistance
total below zero. In this case, the character’s body is working against
him, compounding the additional damage done. Gamemasters have
three options for handling this: (1) They may use the negative damage resistance total as a positive bonus to all diﬃculties until the
character is healed. (2) They may have the negative damage resistance

• Page 65
Adjusting the Deadliness
Changing the Body Points system is fairly obvious: More
Body Points lead to longer character life spans, while fewer
points bring about the end quicker. Altering the Wound level
system is a little more involved and can be handled in a few
diﬀerent ways.
Gamemasters who want to add Wound levels may include
additional versions of the same level, similar to the way
Wounded and Severely Wounded are handled currently.
Alternatively, they may add additional levels between each
one by spreading out the points currently needed to reach
each level, or even add further point levels between Mortally
Wounded and Dead.
Gamemasters who wish to remove Wound levels may
include the lower limit of a deleted level in the next level
up or the upper limit in the next level down. Or they may
simply take levels out of the bottom and shift all remaining
levels down.

total add positively to the amount of injury caused. This is a good
method for simulating gritty adventures, as well as a way of getting
low-level gamemaster’s characters out of the way. (3) Have the damage resistance total equal zero. This last way works best for less than
realistic types of adventures, such as comedic fantasy.

Massive Damage Option
If a character incurs two Wound levels within a single round, not
only do the normal modiﬁers for the greatest level apply, the character also can do nothing but defend or run away on the next two
rounds. In either of these rounds, the character may make an Easy
stamina or mettle attempt, as an action, to try to recover from the
blow and shake oﬀ the penalty. If this is declared as a multi-action
for the round, then the character takes the multi-action penalty. If
not, and the stamina or mettle roll is successful, the character may
act as normal in the next round.

Killing Blow Option
An attack or series of attacks can cause enough injury that the
target may never recover from the harm except through metaphysical or other extraordinary or supernatural measures. Called a killing
blow, targets with Body Points must take a damage total equal to
91% of the character’s maximum Body Points in one blow or 100%
of the character’s maximum Body Points in a single round. With
Wound Levels, the killing blow entails a Mortally Wounded result
with one blow or gaining the Dead level in a single round. In either
case, use the damage total after subtracting the damage resistance
total to determine whether the attack delivered a killing blow. When
the target receives a killing blow, he immediately dies.

CHAPTER IX

• Healing •
What’s in this Chapter
There are many diﬀerent ways that characters can regain their
health. Characters may never get back more than their maximum
number of Body Points or Wounds.

Body Points
Natural Healing
The body heals naturally during the course of the day. The more
rest characters get, the faster their wounds heal. Using the “Body
Points Healing” chart, the character rolls her Physique plus a modiﬁer based on how much rest she’s had that day. A character gets a
modiﬁer of +1D on each full day of rest (sleeping, reading, or other
sedentary activities). If she is involved in light activity, such as walking
or singing, the modiﬁer is zero. However, if most of the day is spent
ﬁghting and running, the modiﬁer is -1D. The character receives the
Body Points back at the beginning of the next day.
Optionally, the gamemaster may require an injured character to
complete a period of rest before making the natural healing roll. Use
the “Rest Period” chart and the character’s Wound level to determine
how long the character needs to wait before attempting the natural
healing roll. The gamemaster then multiplies the result by 3 to ﬁgure
out how many Body Points were healed.

Skill
Characters can heal others or themselves with some basic ﬁeld
procedures for treating wounds. Such attempts don’t require a healer’s
pack. Simply roll healing to help an injured comrade, and ﬁnd the
results on the “Body Points Healing” chart. A successful roll heals

the character the listed amount. A character using a healer’s pack
may add its bonus to the roll.
A character may only attempt to heal a patient once per day. Other
characters may also try to help the patient, adding their expertise
to the ﬁrst healer’s.

Wound Levels
Natural Healing
A character can heal naturally, but this process is slow. The
character must rest a speciﬁed amount of time and then can make
a natural healing roll: roll the character’s full Physique and ﬁnd the
result on the chart related to the character’s current Wound level to
see if the character heals.
Healing characters can do virtually nothing but rest. Characters
who try to work, exercise, or adventure must subtract 1D from their
Physique when they makes their natural healing roll. Any character

who opts to take it easy and do virtually nothing for twice the necessary time may add 1D to the Physique roll to heal.

Characters can heal others or themselves with some basic ﬁeld
procedures for treating wounds. Such attempts don’t require a healer’s
pack. Simply roll healing to treat wounds in the ﬁeld, and ﬁnd the
results on the “Assisted Healing” chart.
A successful roll heals the character up one level: For instance,
a successful healing roll on someone who’s Wounded would bring
him back to Stunned. A character using a healer’s pack may add its
bonus to the roll.
A character may only attempt to heal a patient once per day. Other
characters may also try to help the patient, adding their expertise
to the ﬁrst healer’s.

A character at the Stunned Wound level may make a

level once she’s rested for a minute. After recovering,
should the character get to the Stunned level again, the
character may make another natural healing attempt
after the minute of rest. However, if the character moves
to the Wounded level, she may not make her natural
healing roll until she’s rested for three days.

CHAPTER X

• Combat Options •
What’s in this Chapter
Players sometimes want their characters to do some pretty fancy
maneuvers during combat. This chapter oﬀer guidance with several
common ones.

Using the Modifiers
All modiﬁers are cumulative, though the gamemaster doesn’t
need to include all of them. Modiﬁers may never adjust the total
combat diﬃculty below 3.
The gamemaster rolls the indicated modiﬁer and adds it to the
combat situation. A standard modiﬁer is included in parentheses after
the die modiﬁer, should the gamemaster prefer not to roll.

Fighting & Melee
Combat Options

Acrobatic Tricks: Acrobatics can also enhance ﬁghting and melee
combat attacks. The character must perform the acrobatics trick and
the attack on the same turn. The gamemaster determines the exact
diﬃculty of the acrobatics attempt. The player may add one-half of
the diﬀerence (rounded up) between the diﬃculty and the successful
acrobatics roll to the amount of damage done (not to the combat skill
roll). One acrobatics trick roll can aﬀect one attack only.
All-out: The character attacks with no thought to the
consequences. The target has a better chance of being hit,
but, in that round, the attacker cannot actively defend — or
perform any other action — at all!
Lunge: The character takes a step forward to jab at an
opponent, usually with an edged weapon. This adds about a
half-meter (more or less depending on the stride) to the range
of the attack, but it lowers the eﬀectiveness of the attack.
Knockdown/Push/Trip: Using ﬁghting or a blunt melee
weapon in the usual way, the attacker causes his target to
stumble and, instead of taking damage, the opponent loses
2D from her next Agility or Agility-based skill roll. If this
is a knockdown or trip attempt, she must also spend one
action to stand up again. Generally, unless the character has
special training, he may only knockdown or push a character
whose Physique (including Special Abilities or Disadvantage
modiﬁers) is equal to or less than his own.
Sweep: These attacks, usually foot sweeps or roundhouses, are used when the character wants to make certain she
hits the target, regardless of how much injury is caused.

Tackle: Tackling is much like grabbing, except that the attacker
seeks to overcome the target entirely. Characters may perform this with
ﬁghting only. If successful or the target chooses not to struggle, the
character captures the target and may, if desired, do normal damage.
The target, meanwhile, may make no actions other than attempt to
escape (see the escape rules herein). On subsequent rounds, the attacker
may choose to do her Strength Damage only (no modiﬁers).
Grab: The attacker physically grasps a target. Few melee weapons
allow this option, so it is used generally only in ﬁghting attacks. What
eﬀect this has on the target depends on the type of grab. (The ones
listed here are choke, ﬂip, hold, slam/throw, and arm pin.) See the escape
rules in this chapter for details on getting out of grabs. On subsequent
rounds of a grab, the attacker may do his Strength Damage only (no
modiﬁers except those from Special Abilities or equipment) if he
defeats the victim’s escape attempt or if the defender chooses not
to resist. Some grab variations may oﬀer other options.
Choke: Ropes and hands can cut oﬀ the target’s source of air.
Damage on the ﬁrst round equals the character’s Strength Damage
plus any modiﬁers. See the general grab rules for damage on subsequent rounds.
Flip: The character reaches out, grabs his opponent’s wrist, arm,
leg, or similar body part, and jerks violently, causing the opponent

If the opponent does not resist, the diﬃculty equals 2 times the
target’s Physique or lifting die code plus the pips plus any relevant
protection. Failing to beat the breaking diﬃculty in this case means
the target takes damage as in option 1.
If the target chooses to resist, she may make no other action in
the round, but she may move her turn up. Instead, the player rolls
her character’s Physique or lifting and adds 5 and any relevant protection to the total to generate the breaking diﬃculty. Failure by the
attacker to beat the breaking diﬃculty in this case means that the
target escapes and may freely take action on the next round.

Other Modifiers

• Option 3. The character may attempt to force the target to the
ground while maintaining his hold on the arm. The attacker rolls his
ﬁghting against a submission diﬃculty.
If the opponent does not resist, the submission diﬃculty equals 2
times her Agility die code, dropping the pips. Failing to beat the breaking
diﬃculty in this case means the target takes damage as in option 1.
If the target chooses to resist, the opponent may make no other
action in the round, though she may move her turn up. Instead,
the player rolls her character’s Agility and adds 5 and any relevant
modiﬁers to the total to generate the submission diﬃculty. Failure by
the attacker to beat the diﬃculty in this case means that the target
escapes and may freely take action on the next round.

• The attacker is blind or blinded: +4D (+12) to the
combat diﬃculty.
• The target is blind or blinded or attacked from behind:
-4D (-12) to the combat diﬃculty.

Called Shot
to fall to the ground. The opponent takes 3D in damage from slamming into the ground and must spend the next round getting to her
feet (if she can).
Hold: The character does less damage (-3D or more, at the player’s
option, to the damage total), but she has hold of the target with a
successful attack.
Slam/Throw: The character grabs or picks up his opponent and
hurls him into the ground, a wall, a bus, or another obstacle. Lifting
the opponent up counts as an action (using the lifting skill), as does
slamming or throwing the target (which uses the throwing skill).
The character must be strong enough to pick his opponent up to
use this maneuver.
Once slammed into an object, the target takes the damage score of
the object (usually determined by its Toughness, but the gamemaster
may adjust this) plus the attacker’s Strength Damage. The object being
slammed into takes the Strength Damage of the opponent.
Arm Pin: The hero grabs his target’s arm and forces it around
behind her, pinning it there. After the ﬁrst round, the player has
three choices as to what his character can do. Each option counts
as a separate action.
• Option 1. The character does his Strength Damage only for each
round he has the arm pinned.
• Option 2. The character tries to break the opponent’s arm.
The attacker must make a successful Physique or lifting roll versus a
breaking diﬃculty.

The character chooses a speciﬁc target, like a dagger in a thief’s hand,
and aims for that. This is represented by a called-shot modiﬁer, which
is added to the combat diﬃculty. On a successful attack, he knocks the
item out of the target’s hand, grabs the limb, pins the target to a wall,
or does +1D (or more, at the gamemaster’s discretion) to the damage.
The exact result depends on the situation and the player’s intent.

Breaking Things
When a character speciﬁcally attempts to break something,
compare the skill total with the object’s damage resistance total (its
Toughness modiﬁed by size, thickness, ﬂaws, supports, etc.). Items
that take at least 10 points above their damage resistance total are
severely damaged, if not destroyed. Items taking less than that are
weakened, and another attempt may be made (with the object having
a reduced damage resistance total and possibly other problems). The
“Object Toughness” table lists some suggested durabilities.

Chapter 10

Disarm
If the disarm attempt is successful and the target character
has not made an action yet, she may move up her action to try
and keep a grip on the item she’s holding. The defending character
makes a Physique or lifting roll against the amount of damage
done. If the defender’s roll is greater than the damage, the target
character retains the item. If it is less than or equal to the damage, she drops it.

Entangle
A hero throws an entangling weapon at her opponent. On a
successful marksmanship or throwing roll (as appropriate), the end
of the weapon wraps itself around the target. Unless the weapon
is spiked or enhanced in some other way, it does no damage, but it
prevents the target from doing any action except for trying to break
free. The target may escape by snapping the bonds or slipping free,
each of which counts as an action. To break the weapon, he must
make a Physique or lifting roll that meets or beats the damage total
of the weapon. To slip free, he needs to roll an Agility or acrobatics
total equal to or higher than the weapon’s damage total.

Escape
To break free from any hold, the character must make a successful opposed Physique or lifting roll versus the holder’s Physique
or lifting. This counts as an action.

Group Attack
This is a coordinated action. See the description of the command
skill in the “Example Skill Diﬃculties” chapter for details.

Hit Location
Hit locations are a special kind of called shot that allows a
character to shoot or strike a speciﬁc point on his target’s body.
The table is used to determine the modiﬁers for hitting a target of
Human proportions in diﬀerent areas of his body. Note that aiming
at an arm or leg actually causes less damage — this is because the
character took extra care to shoot an area that is “less vital.”

Knockout
This option does only half of the normal damage, but it can
render the target immediately unconscious with a successful
attack. It requires a successful called shot to the head. If, after the
resistance total has been subtracted, the target sustains at least
two Wound levels or 50% of his maximum Body Points in damage,
then he falls unconscious for a number of hours equal to diﬀerence
between the combat skill total and the combat diﬃculty or until
he’s awoken by some external force, whichever comes ﬁrst. The
target receives only half the Wound levels or Body Point damage
inﬂicted (round down).

Multiple Weapons
Weapons that characters can use with one hand and in either
hand, such as daggers, may be employed at the same time in the
same round. The character incurs a multi-action penalty.

Effects
At the gamemaster’s discretion, suﬃcient damage to a particular
hit location can aﬀect the target’s ability to use that part. Except
for blows to the chest, the modiﬁer lasts until the character heals
that portion (which typically takes a few days, as Body Points or
Wounds are recovered for the body as a whole, not just a speciﬁc
part). When the medicine skill or a healing spell or miracle is applied,
it can be speciﬁed to repair one particular location.
Hit location modiﬁers are in addition to Wound level modiﬁers.
If you are using them instead of the Wound level modiﬁers, then
all -1 modiﬁers increase to -1D modiﬁers.
Chest: The character can do no more than passively defend in
the next round.
Foot or leg: -1 to all acrobatics, stealth, movement, and initiative totals.
Hand or arm: -1 to all acrobatics, ﬁghting, climbing, melee combat,
marksmanship, sleight of hand, throwing, lifting, and any other rolls
involving the hand or arm.
Head: -1 to all Intellect, Acumen, and initiative totals.

Prone & Crouching
Attacking a target that is crouched on the ground adds 1D (3) to
the combat diﬃculty. If the target is moving while crouching, then the
combat diﬃculty increases by +2D (+6), but the defending character’s
normal Move, free Move, or running roll is halved.
For prone targets, subtract 2D (6) from the combat diﬃculty when
attacking at Point Blank or Short range, but add 2D (6) to combat
diﬃculty when attacking at Medium or Long range.
Characters who willingly get low to the ground or make themselves
small may get into and out of the position as a free action. However,
character forced into that position, such as a result of being thrown,
need to make an eﬀort to stand, which counts as an action.

Quick Draw
This option allows the character to act rapidly or draw and shoot
a weapon in the same round as one action. The character may use
any combat skill or appropriate specialization. If she is also using a
weapon, it must be suitable for quick drawing (a bow and arrow, a
loaded musket, a dagger, a rock).

Combat Options

• Page 71

Before initiative is rolled, the player must announce that she
intends for her character to draw her weapon quickly. The player
may then take some of the skill dice and add them to the Acumen die
code for purposes of increasing initiative for that round only. The
player must leave at least 1D in her skill. If the character wants to
make multiple attacks, she subtracts 1D for each attack beyond the
ﬁrst from the number of dice in the skill she’s using before the player
moves dice around. She does not take a penalty for the draw.
All attacks by the hero in the same round must be made with the
same skill, though the results are determined diﬀerently and they
all occur at the same die code because the multi-action penalty was
already ﬁgured in.
Example: A ranger wants to strike with his daggers at an evil
sorceress before the villain can cast a spell. The ranger has 4D in
Acumen and 8D in throwing. He may take up to 7D and add it to his
Acumen die code to determine initiative. The ranger, however, wants
to throw two daggers. After subtracting 1D for the extra attack, he
now has 7D in the skill, which allows him to add up to 6D to the initiative roll. He decides to move only 3D. This gives him 7D in Acumen
to determine initiative and 4D in throwing. Now both the hero and
the villain make their initiative rolls.
Once initiative is determined, at the character’s turn in the round,
he uses the remaining dice in the skill to determine his accuracy.

Ready a Weapon
It takes one action per item to unsheathe a knife, ready a bow
for the ﬁrst shot, or something similar. (Some weapons, such as a
crossbow or a very long weapon, take longer.) Although this generally
does not require a skill roll, the gamemaster may require one related
to the weapon in question for particularly stressful situations. Additionally, drawing and using the weapon in the same round incurs a
multi-action penalty. The gamemaster may add further modiﬁers for
attempting to get out an item from a restrictive location or ready an
unwieldy weapon.

Scale
Occasionally, objects of vastly diﬀerent sizes get
involved in ﬁghts. The scale modiﬁer accounts for the
fact that bigger items are easier to hit, and usually can
take more damage, than smaller ones. Use the accompanying chart as a guide for determining the appropriate
value for the two combat participants. Gamemasters
may further subdivide between levels.
If both opponents are either larger than or equal to a
Human or smaller than or equal to a Human, subtract the
larger number from the smaller one to calculate the scale
modiﬁer. If one opponent is smaller than a Human while
the other is larger, then add together the two values.
For most cases, use these rules: If the attacker is
larger than the defender, then the scale modiﬁer is
added to the combat diﬃculty (the defender’s defense
value) and the damage total. If the attacker is smaller
than the defender, then the scale modiﬁer is added
to the attacker’s combat skill total and the defender’s
damage resistance total.

Example: An adventuring Centaur wanders into a cave where
several rats teasing ... something. The rats have a scale value of 9,
but are smaller than a Human. With the Centaur’s scale value of 3
larger than a Human, the scale modiﬁer is 12 (3 + 9). Because the rat
is smaller than the adventurer, each rat gets a +12 to its ﬁghting roll,
while the adventurer gets a +12 to his damage resistance total. When
the Centaur attacks a rat, the scale modiﬁer is added to his combat
diﬃculty and to his damage total, if he manages to stab it.
In some cases, the object may be large but lightly constructed
(such as a hot air balloon). At these times, the gamemaster should
not add the scale modiﬁer to the damage resistance total.
Typically, a weapon’s scale when determining how much damage it
does is the same as the person holding it or the thing it’s mounted on.
So, a sword has a scale value of 0, while an elephant’s tusk has a scale
of 10. These would diﬀer if someone targeted just the weapon.

Surprise
A hero who surprises her opponent may either act ﬁrst in the round
(if initiative hasn’t already been determined) or gain a +1D to her
action. Attacks from behind, an ambush, or unexpected sources (such
as a companion) make up the most
common sources of surprise.

Unwieldy Weapon
Melee weapons longer than 60
centimeters, objects that are hard
to throw or grasp, ones relying on
technology with which the user is
unfamiliar, or any weapons otherwise diﬃcult to wield may incur a
+5 or more modiﬁer to the combat
diﬃculty. Similarly, a character may
use a two-handed weapon with one
hand if she can lift the weapon with
one hand, though she receives the
unwieldy weapon modiﬁer. The
gamemaster may decide that such
factors as experience, strength,
and features of the weapon (such
as a well-balanced sword) lower
this modiﬁer.

CHAPTER XI

• Example Skill
Difficulties •
What’s in this Chapter
The “Character Basics” chapter provided brief descriptions of each
skill (and you will need to return to that chapter if you need a refresher).
When the generic diﬃculties aren’t enough, look up various skills in
this chapter to get even more ideas on the challenge level for using
those skills in common situations. Of course, not every possibility
has been covered, but this provides a terriﬁc foundation.

Using the Difficulties &
Modifiers
Unless otherwise stated, the listed modiﬁers are to the diﬃculty.
The minimum diﬃculty is 1. Modiﬁers may be cumulative, depending on the situation — the tenser they are, the more important the
minutia become.
The associated attributed is listed after the skill name.

Extranormal Skills
Descriptions and diﬃculties for Extranormal skills are found in
their own chapters.

Combat Skills (Agility,
Coordination)
Skills covered: fighting, dodge, marksmanship, melee combat,
throwing
Diﬃculties for these skills are included in the “Combat” chapter.
For throwing, see also that skill’s entry in this chapter.

Information Skills
(Intellect)
Skills covered: cultures, devices, scholar, trading
The Intellect attribute assists characters in ﬁnding out how much
they know about a certain ﬁeld, modiﬁed depending on the situation.
For this reason, one chart of general diﬃculties can serve most uses
of Intellect, trading, and scholar, some uses of devices, and investigation
attempts involving researching a topic.
Gamemasters can employ the “Information Diﬃculties” chart in
one of two ways: by picking a diﬃculty based on what the character
seeks or wants to recall, or by comparing the skill total rolled to
the diﬃculties (whichever level the character meets or beats is the

amount and type of information collected or recollected). Realize that
the less well-deﬁned the skill is, the less information the character
knows or ﬁnds.
One high roll in any of these skills does not necessarily make the
character an expert in that ﬁeld. The roll represents only what the
character recalls at the time. A high roll could reveal a speciﬁc detail
of the information sought, as well as some hints for discovering more
of what the character seeks.
Characters may be assumed to have a general knowledge of their
home country, culture, and era, including basic geography, famous
people, and common etiquette.

Interaction Skills (Charisma)
Skills covered: bluﬀ, charm, intimidation, persuasion
Characters use one of several Charisma-based skills to inﬂuence
other people that they meet. The typical diﬃculty is 10, modiﬁed
based on the dispositions of the characters involved, but a gamemaster may base it on a skill roll. See the “Mental Defenses” section
for more information on this; suggested diﬃculty modiﬁers are
listed below.
Die rolls alone should not determine interactions between player
and gamemaster characters. Gamemasters should have their players
detail what their characters say and do to before rolling the dice. The
better the player acts the role of his character, the greater his chance

Example Skill Difficulties
of success should be, which gamemasters can reﬂect by allowing up
to a +1D modiﬁer to the skill roll.
See also the individual entries in this chapter for bluﬀ, charm (listed
with bluﬀ), intimidation (also listed with bluﬀ), and persuasion.

Mental Defenses
In general, the resistance diﬃculty for any interaction skill equals
10. The target cannot actively resist unless he knows that a psychic
or interaction skill is being used on him by another character. If the
gamemaster decides that the target suspects but does not know for
certain that someone is attempting to inﬂuence him, the gamemaster
may allow the character to take an action earlier than his turn in the
round and roll his mettle or Charisma to generate a new resistance
diﬃculty. Should the character decide to actively defend against
mental intrusion or personal interaction, he may devote all of his
actions for the round to that task and roll his mettle or Charisma,
adding +10 to the score to get the new resistance diﬃculty. However
the interaction resistance diﬃculty is determined, gamemasters may
further modify the number as the situation warrants (such as stress,
surprise, or character relationship).

Observation Skills (Acumen)
Skills covered: search, tracking
Gamemasters can rely on these diﬃculties for situations involving
the gathering of information. They can be used as diﬃculties to beat
or as a means of reading the results of a dice toss.
To see if a character notices details of a scene or situation, the
gamemaster may have the player make a Acumen roll. Unless the char-

total meets or beats the diﬃculty, the character gains that much
information.

Charioteering, Pilotry
(Coordination)
See the “Movement” chapter for details on using these skills.

Bluff, Charm, Intimidation
(Charisma)
Bluﬀ, charm, and intimidation can enhance a character’s attacks
and defenses. The player adds one-half of the diﬀerence (positive or
negative) between the diﬃculty and the bluﬀ, charm, or intimidation
roll to any one attack or defense attempt (not both) made at Point
Blank or Short range. The character must use the beneﬁt from scaring
(intimidation), tricking (bluﬀ), or seducing (charm) the target on the
same turn as or on the round after the interaction endeavor.
The user’s appearance and demeanor can also aﬀect bluﬀ, charm,
or intimidation attempts. The more threatening the character looks or
seems, the less eﬀective charm and bluﬀ actions are, while intimidation attempts are more eﬀective. Use the “Generic Modiﬁers” table
in the “Game Basics” chapter to decide how much the appearance
and demeanor aﬀect the target, if a Disadvantage or Special Ability
doesn’t already provide one.
See also “Interaction Skills” for other diﬃculties and modiﬁers
for these skills.

Difficulties for these skills

Chapter 11

Hide (Acumen),
Stealth (Agility)
The diﬃculty for a hide or stealth attempt is usually the opponent’s
Acumen, search (for hide), or tracking (for stealth), either as a die roll
(if the opponent is actively trying to ﬁnd the object or person) or
as a derived value equal to the number in front of the “D” in the
opponent’s attribute or skill times 2 and add the pips. For a straight
value, use 6.
Gamemasters may also opt to add a small creature or item’s scale
value to the diﬃculty, or subtract a large creature or item’s scale
value to it.

Reading/Writing, Speaking
(Intellect)
Because the ability to read in the typical fantasy setting is so
uncommon, the ability to communicate falls under two skills: reading/writing and speaking. They both use the same charts, but they
relate to two diﬀerent methods of communicating.
First, determine what the character wants to express or understand
and how closely the language in which she wants to express it is to
her native tongue. Then, compare the diﬀerence between the skill
roll and the diﬃculty to decide how close she came. Characters with a
specialization in the language they are using who succeed at the skill
roll receive a +3 bonus to determining the comprehension level.
Gamemasters may provide a small bonus to characters with a
specialization of a particular language in one skill when they attempt
to use the other skill for that language. For instance, a character with
a reading/writing specialization +1D in Elvish and no experience in
speaking could gain a bonus of +1 to attempting to say something
in Elvish.
The character must have the appropriate skill to use a translation aid. For example, a book cannot help a character attempting

A character can also use the reading/writing skill to create forgeries.
The artist skill might act as a complementary skill in such instances
as reproducing illuminated manuscripts. Reduce the amount of time
spent on making a particular forgery if the character has repeatedly
succeeded at making similar items in the past.

See the “Information Skills” for diﬃculties and modiﬁers related
to using this skill.

Acrobatics (Agility)
Using acrobatics can also improve many of a character’s climbing,
jumping, and running attempts. The gamemaster determines the difﬁculty of the acrobatics stunt. One-half of the diﬀerence (rounded up)
between the diﬃculty and the acrobatics roll is added to the complementary skill. The acrobatics attempt and the climbing, jumping, or
running try must be done on the same turn.
Instead of adding a modiﬁer to the running or swimming diﬃculty
for particularly challenging obstacle courses, the gamemaster may
have the hero make an acrobatics roll in addition to a running or
swimming roll.
Acrobatics can make a character appear more intimidating. The
player may add one-half of the diﬀerence (rounded up) between
the diﬃculty and the successful acrobatics roll to her intimidation
attempt. The intimidating attempt may be made on the same turn
as the acrobatics roll or on the next round.
During a fall, acrobatics may be used to reduce bodily harm. If the
character has not already used his turn for the round, he may rely on
acrobatics in an attempt to land properly. The character generates an
acrobatics total. For every ﬁve points over the base diﬃculty number
of 10, the hero reduces the damage total by one point, in addition
to a base reduction of one point. The damage total, however, cannot
be lower than zero.

Animal Handling (Charisma)
When attempting to get an animal to do a trick, the character
must also roll against its mettle roll (the gamemaster generates this).
Examples of tricks include rolling over, getting into a cage, jumping
up, and obeying commands. The character’s animal handling total may
be modiﬁed by the attitude of the animal toward the character. The
success of tricks are determined by a roll of the animal’s attributes
or skills.

Artist (Acumen)
The time needed to create a work of art depends on the quality
and complexity of a piece. A simple amateur piece may only take a

few minutes, while a complex, prize-winning endeavor could require
weeks or months. Characters may also use this skill to judge works
of art created by others and detect fake artistic pieces. The higher
the total is above the creation total for the piece, the more information the judge knows about it (such as ﬂaws, alterations, its creator,
and the like).

Command (Charisma)
The command skill governs the act of convincing individuals to
comply with speciﬁc directions, as well as maintaining morale during group undertakings (such as combat or building large pieces of
equipment). This skill is typically used only with the gamemaster’s
characters, though it can be sometimes attempted with the players’
characters (such situations should be roleplayed ﬁrst, with a bonus
or penalty to the command roll based on how well the group participated in the activity together). A high command roll can complement
individual participants’ rolls in a group activity, while a low command
roll can impose negative modiﬁers. It generally requires at least one
round of planning to perform eﬀectively.
Characters can use this skill to combine their attacks. One person
is designated the leader and makes the command roll. If successful,
everyone goes on the leader’s initiative. Participants make their
attacks with the hit location modiﬁer (to reﬂect that they’re aiming
for a designated location), but the target resists the combined total
of all damage done it. If the command roll fails, determine initiative
and actions individually.

Contortion (Agility)
The chart below contains sample diﬃculty numbers for escaping
from various kinds of restraints. Modify the diﬃculty based on the
circumstances of the escape, such as the conditions the character
works under or specially designed restraints. The character may not
use this skill if completely immobilized. If in multiple restraints, the
character must make a separate roll for each one. A Critical Failure
indicates that the character has pulled a muscle (and he does his
Strength Damage to himself). The gamemaster decides whether he
may try again.
Note that this skill does not substitute for the lockpicking skill.
The character may be able to pull his arms over his head to use his
hands, but he may not be able to slip out of the shackles unless they

Crafting (Acumen)
The base diﬃculty to ﬁx or modify any weapon, armor, other
equipment, or vehicle is 10. The amount of damage sustained, the
character’s familiarity with the item, availability of parts, and complexity of the task can modify the diﬃculty. The gamemaster may
require a separate devices roll to determine whether the character
can ﬁgure out how to repair an unknown item. Destroyed parts must
be replaced, which raises the diﬃculty. Additionally, if a character
rushes the job, not only is there an increased chance of failure, but
the item could also break again soon after its next use.
A gamemaster may allow a complementary use of artist to improve
the quality of the item.

Devices (Intellect)
The devices skill allows the character how to use a strange new
piece of equipment. In some cases, no matter how familiar the item
is to a character, the item may be of such complexity (such as some
gnomish works) that the gamemaster always requires a roll.
Characters who want to create new items must ﬁrst makes blueprints or design instructions for them, using this skill. The more
complex the piece, the higher the diﬃculty and the longer it takes
to determine the correct design.

A character’s skill total in creating the disguise serves two
related purposes. First, the higher the roll, the less likely an
observer will be to question the disguise. Second, the total
becomes the diﬃculty number for Acumen or investigation
eﬀorts to see through it. If the investigation check is higher
than the disguise total, the disguise has been penetrated.
If at any time while the character is disguised she performs an
action inconsistent with the disguise, any observer has a chance to
see through it.
Although one character may use disguise on another character, the
disguised character must actively work at keeping up the disguise
using her own disguise skill or Acumen.

Gambling (Acumen)
Gambling doesn’t aﬀect games that are purely random, but does
inﬂuence games with an element of strategy, like poker. All characters
make opposed gambling rolls, without spending Character or Fate Points,
and the highest roll wins. A character may cheat by using Character or
Fate Points on the roll, and the gamemaster may give bonuses to rolls
for people looking for a cheater or helping the cheater. The gamemaster
should consider as many “angles” as possible when using the gambling
skill, and add these as modiﬁers to one or more participants’ rolls.

Healing (Intellect)
For game mechanics on using healing to treat damage, see the
“Healing” chapter. Remember that the typical fantasy setting doesn’t
have the same access to medical procedures as they do in modern
times. However, folk lore remedies seemed to work much better
than in other genres.

Know-how (Acumen)
To use this skill to help with an activity covered by another skill
(which the character does not have), the character spends the round
before examining the situation, performing no other actions, and
making a roll of this skill versus the diﬃculty set for the action. The
character gets neither the unskilled modiﬁer nor the preparing modiﬁer. Within the next 30 seconds (six rounds), the character may add
the diﬀerence between the diﬃculty and the know-how skill roll to
total roll for the attribute dictated by the actual skill required. The
character may not use this skill in place of a skill she already has. The
gamemaster may limit the number of times per hour this skill may
be used on the same action.

Lifting (Physique)
At the gamemaster’s discretion, a player may make a lifting check
when his character ﬁrst picks up an object. (Generally, if the object’s
weight would give it a diﬃculty equal to or greater than one-half of
the character’s lifting, rounded up, or the object is being lifted hastily
or under stress, the gamemaster should require a lifting roll.)
For each round the object is carried, the character makes another
check to see if he can continue to carry the object. If he fails the roll,
he is too exhausted and must put the object down. If the character is
doing anything else at the time (other than walking slowly or talking),
continuing to carry the object counts as a multi-action.

Mettle (Charisma)
Mettle is generally used to resist interaction attempts and

earlier in this chapter for details. Characters with this skill
may generally use it instead of stamina to resist fatigue, sleep,
and unconsciousness, though there may be some situations
the gamemaster restricts its substitution. See the stamina
entry in this chapter for information on diﬃculties.
Gamemaster can also use mettle (or Charisma) to determine the reactions of players’ and gamemaster’s characters
to each other and to their surroundings. The more the
gamemaster believes that the character should be at ease or
frightened, the greater the diﬃculty. Use the descriptions
of standard diﬃculties to determine the level. This passive
application of mettle is not an action.

Persuasion (Charisma)
Persuasion can also be employed to “pay” another person to behave

divulging secret information. Success depends greatly on the target.
A target who is loyal or wealthy or fears being caught is less likely to
accept bribes. Use the diﬃculties listed under “Interaction Skills” and
further modiﬁed by such factors as the value of the money, goods,
or information oﬀered, the extent of favors given and received, and

Riding (Agility)

Search (Acumen)

When a character ﬁrst mounts a ridable animal, she must make a
riding roll against the creature’s mettle roll (the gamemaster generates
this). The character’s riding total may be modiﬁed by the attitude of
the animal toward the character. The character stays in control if
she ties or beats the beast’s roll. If she fails, consult the table below
for what occurs.
When attempting to get the beast to perform a special maneuver
or during events that might frighten it, the character must also
roll against the animal’s Charisma or mettle. Examples of special
maneuvers include jumping a fence, crossing a raging river, moving
faster, or slowing down quickly. (The success of special maneuvers
are determined with the animal’s attributes or skills.)
A character attacking from the back of a beast takes a multiaction penalty for having to both control the mount and use their
weapon.

When used to eavesdrop on or secretly watch an event or another
character, the skill total indicates the amount of information gained
from the surveillance. Use the “Observation Diﬃculties” table. A
Critical Failure could mean anything from no information obtained
to being immediately spotted by the character being observed,
depending on the situation.
When searching for a hidden object or person, the diﬃculty is
generally the hide roll used to conceal the target. Otherwise, the base

Stamina (Physique)
Gamemasters may allow a character to make a multi-action stamina
roll to complement a strenuous activity, such as lifting or running.
The diﬃculty equals 5 times the current fatigue modiﬁer. The character may add one-half (rounded up) of the diﬀerence between the
successful stamina roll and the diﬃculty. The strenuous activity still
receives the fatigue modiﬁer.
Whenever a character fails a stamina roll, she is fatigued; all actions
are at -1D for every stamina check failed until the character rests for
as long as she exerted herself.

Example Skill Difficulties

• Page 81

Characters can still continue if they are fatigued, until they fail
a third stamina check. At this point, the character is completely
exhausted and must rest for twice the amount of time that she
exerted herself to remove the penalty.
To avoid the eﬀects of a toxin (inhaled, ingested, or absorbed) or
disease (encountered in any manner), a character makes a stamina roll.
Several factors ﬁgure into the diﬃculty of the attempt, including the
deadliness and dosage of the poison in question. For example, a fatal
bout of botulism has a diﬃculty of 9, while a killing dose of deadly
nightshade has a diﬃculty of 42. Characters may attempt to counter
toxins once per day.
Gamemasters might also call for stamina rolls against falling asleep
or unconscious. This generally does not count as an action, though
the gamemaster should award a bonus to the skill total when the
character devotes her action to keeping awake. Resisting sleep is a
diﬃculty of 5 per hour beyond the normal awake time, modiﬁed by
environmental factors (too warm or too cold, noise level, etc.). For
unconsciousness caused by wounds, see the “Wound Levels” table
in the “Damage” chapter.

Streetwise (Acumen)
Streetwise helps characters get around urban environments. Some
situations call for seeking out those living outside the local law,
while others can be handled through upstanding citizens. Generally,
the modiﬁers are the same for each situation, but the gamemaster
should adjust them depending on the circumstances. It is possible,
though generally unlikely, that a character would be well-liked by
both upstanding residents and local criminals.
Example: In a village, a character would ﬁnd it easier to gather
information about a particular person (and thus the city-size modiﬁer would be -15 instead of +15), but he might have a harder time
getting someone to trust him enough to tell him about it (making
the tolerance modiﬁer +15).

Survival (Acumen)
Character can rely on survival to ﬁgure what to eat, where to sleep,
how best to deal with native dangers, and other information needed
to get out of wilderness situation alive. The character can also use
survival to locate herbs, plants, and animals of special healing or
mystical value. (Use streetwise for help in urban situations.)

Throwing (Coordination)
A character’s ability to grab projectiles out of the air is enhanced
by the throwing skill. The diﬃculty of catching an object is typically
the thrower’s throwing roll. If the thrower wants the catcher to get
the object, and thus takes care to throw well, reduce the thrower’s
skill total by 9.
Combat diﬃculties for this skill are included in the “Combat”
chapter.

Tracking (Acumen)
The base diﬃculty is 10 or the target’s stealth roll, if the target
is actively trying to hide her trail. Characters can also use tracking
to shadow a target. A shadowed character can attempt to spot the
shadow with a search roll versus the shadowing character’s tracking
roll. Gamemasters may opt to include relevant hide modiﬁers to the
tracking roll, if the shadow is being cautious.

Traps (Intellect)
To install a trap, use the chart to modify the base diﬃculty of zero.
The gamemaster may award one-half of the points above the diﬃculty
as a modiﬁer to future disarm rolls. This represents the character
adding a few extra improvements to the base design.
A pressure plate trigger releases the trap when a small piece of
metal or wood (about a quarter-meter square) is stepped on or pushed.
Pressure plates may be on the ﬂoor or wall. A tripwire trigger releases
the trap when a wire, cord, or other material attached to the tripwire is
walked through or broken. A switch could be a cord yanked, an outcropping pulled, a lock turned, or something similar. A hand-triggered trap
requires that someone watch for the victim to come within the range
of the trap’s eﬀect and, once that happens, activate the trap.
When a character triggers a trap, use its speed total and compare
it the initiative total of those aﬀected by the trap. Those who have
a higher total than the trap are allowed to generate a full-defense
dodge total, if they so desire.
Once it’s the trap’s turn in the initiative, compare the trap’s combat
attack total to the defense totals of its intended target or targets.
(The combat attack total takes into account range.) The trap aﬀects

• Page 82

those whose defense totals it meets or beats, up to the number of
targets it can aﬀect.
To disarm a trap, the character ﬁrst needs to ﬁnd an access to it,
which means applying the search skill if the trap’s concealed. Once found,
the character rolls her traps against this chart, modiﬁed by how well
it was originally installed. Traps enhanced by spells must have their
spells negated ﬁrst before the character can disarm the trap. Concealing
a trap (including disguising wires, covering a pit or pressure plate, or
placing a false trap) requires using the hide skill on it (or selecting an
appropriate diﬃculty for a gamemaster-created trap).

Lock Trap: When a character attempts to pick the lock
and is successful, a large poisoned needle (damage 5D; speed

diﬃculty: 20.
Pit Trap: The ﬂoor falls away from beneath the characters,
dropping them into a large dug-out area about 4.5 meters
high (damage of 3D from fall). The pit opening is about two
meters on a side. Trap diﬃculty: 13.

CHAPTER XII

• Magic •
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter covers the ability to manipulate the paranormal forces
of the universe for extraordinary eﬀects. The Magic skills are available
only to characters with the Magic Extranormal attribute.
Although this chapter discusses guidelines for creating magical
spells, gamemasters may still include unexplainable magic. Since
unexplainable magic doesn’t have to be explained — it just is — its
use is out of the players’ characters’ control. Only the gamemaster
knows how it works.

Obtaining Access to Magic
There are only two ways for players’ characters to get magical abilities. The ﬁrst is to put dice in the Magic attribute and skills at character
creation, which costs the same as obtaining other attributes.
The second is to obtain the gamemaster’s permission after play
has begun. If the player can come up with a reason for the character
to learn or gain magic abilities (such as they were latent or were a
gift from a supernatural being) and the gamemaster agrees, then
the player may purchase them for the character. The cost to get the
initial 1D in Magic is 20 Character Points. After that, it is 10 times
the number in front of the “D” to improve this attribute by one pip.
The player must still purchase Magic skill pips separately, though a
player may buy one pip in one Magic skill for the character at the same
time as he initially gets the attribute after character creation.
Gamemasters are discouraged from allowing characters to have
multiple Extranormal abilities, but it is possible, especially if the
character has several Disadvantages that show up frequently in
each session or the character’s religion requires experience in both
magic and miracles.

Learning & Improving
Magic Skills
Magic skills may be learned between adventures, like regular skills.
The cost for a Magic skill, in Character Points, equals twice the normal
cost for gaining or improving a normal skill. This cost is doubled again
if a teacher — simply another magic user with the skill at a higher
level — is not available to instruct the character. A character may
learn or improve one Magic skill after each adventure.

Magic Skills
All spells require one of these skills in order to cast them. When
casting a spell, the character generates a Magic skill total and tries
to beat the spell’s diﬃculty. If the skill total equals or exceeds the
diﬃculty, then the spell works (to a greater or lesser extent).

Alteration
Alteration governs magic involving change. Change means taking
something that exists and modifying it or mutating it into something
else. A magic spell used to increase a character’s Physique attribute
would be an alteration spell, as would one that converts a simple
ﬂame into an exploding ﬁreball. Alteration could enhance, reduce,
or restrict a character’s existing skills.
Alteration must work with things that are already there. An alteration spell can only modify existing characteristics. It could be used
to change a person into a bat, but it would not give the person the
ability to ﬂy; conjuration would also be necessary to give the character
the Flight Special Ability, something he didn’t have before.

Apportation
Apportation governs magic involving movement. For example, a
telekinesis spell, by which a character could “grab” an object and move
it using magic, would be an apportation spell. Calling a dagger from
a box at home to your hand is apportation, as is teleporting yourself

Chapter 12

• Page 84

to another place. Apportation can also cause a person or creature to
move from one place to another under its own power. Spells that
restrict movement would also be apportation spells.
Apportation is not conjuration — the object or the creature summoned is in existence at the time the spell is cast, the apportation
spell simply “calls” the object or creature.
Characters or creatures may either be apported by compulsion
(and come under their own power), moved by the spell’s power, or
teleported. When the apportation spell uses compulsion, the skill total
is compared to the target’s mettle or Charisma in much the same way
a persuasion attempt would be used — the target’s attitude toward
being apported must be assessed, and the spell works as if it were
“persuading” the target.
For apportation spells with the speed less than the range, the
target is moved by the spell’s power. The spell lifts up the target and
brings her to the caster. For apportation spells with the speed equal
to the range, the target is teleported. In either case, the apportation
skill total has to overcome the target’s weight value. (Look up the
target’s mass on the “Spell Measures” table.) The target can resist
by rolling her Physique or lifting and adding it to her weight value
(theoretically, she tries to make herself harder for the spell to grasp).
(Resisting does not count as an action for the target character.) If
the apportation total is equal to or higher than the weight value, the
character is teleported. This goes for self-teleportation as well (though
the character is not likely to resist).

Duration: Duration speciﬁes how long a spell’s eﬀect will last. The
duration is given in both “real” time (minutes, seconds, hours, etc.)
and in a time value (as read on the “Spell Measures” table).
Range: The maximum distance the eﬀect travels from the magic
user’s casting location is called the range. (If the magic user moves,
the starting point of the range does not go with her.) In most cases,
the character using the spell can only use it at this range or less.
Often, the caster can choose the exact range when the eﬀect is used.
Sometimes, the character must use the spell at this range exactly.
Ranges are given in meters and in distance values (as read on the
“Spell Measures” table).
Speed: The speed indicates how quickly the spell travels from
the caster to the target.
Casting Time: This aspect indicates how long the character must
spend creating the spell’s eﬀect. During the period of casting time,
the character may be performing related actions (like concentrating,
performing rituals, arranging components, etc.), but no other skills
can be used during the casting time.
Other Aspects: Other aspects of the spell encompass modiﬁers,
including components and expanded eﬀects, that inﬂuence the spell’s
eﬀect and adjust its diﬃculty.
Precalculated spells also include a description, which tells what
skill is needed to create the spell, what the spell does, what any success levels mean, and so on. The description may be very short, or it
may include tables and precise explanations of eﬀects.

Conjuration

Using Spells & Their Effects

Conjuration magic involves producing something from nothing.
A spell that produces gold out of thin air is conjuration, as is one that
imbues an inanimate object with animate features (such as creating a
stone man and giving it the attributes of a person). Conjured items and
characteristics remain in existence for the duration of the spell.
Conjuration is used for only one purpose: creation of something
out of nothing. For example, if you wanted to animate a plant and
give it the power of speech, you would use conjuration — you would
have to “create” in it the ability to talk and the Intellect and Acumen
necessary to speak. Conjuration is not used to bring things from one
place to another — that is apportation.

Divination
Divination governs magic involving obtaining knowledge. For
example, scrying spells, “far-sight” spells, and “speak with the dead”
types of spells are all covered by divination. Spells that block the
obtaining of Intellect are also divination spells.

Characteristics of a Spell
There are eight characteristics of a spell, and the precalculated
spells are formatted using these categories of information.
Skill Used: The skill selected is the one necessary to cast the spell.
A diﬀerent one might be necessary to target or use the spell.
Diﬃculty: The diﬃculty is the skill total a character must generate to get a spell to work.
Eﬀect: The eﬀect describes the primary features of the spell
(amount of damage, amount of protection, distance moved, etc.),
plus the value of the eﬀect.

Roll the spell skill for the spell in question to get a skill total. If
the total is higher than the diﬃculty number, the spell has succeeded
and the caster may use the spell’s eﬀect.
Which skill the spell requires is either decided when the eﬀect is
developed or listed with a precalculated spell.
Remember that players may spend Character or Fate Points to
make sure they have suﬃciently high skill totals to cast the spell.

Targeting or Using the Spell
Many spells require separate targeting or manipulative skill totals
when they are used. The most common of these are combat eﬀects
that act like weapons.
If the spell focuses on a target (such as a heighten attribute or alter
movement spell), the player and gamemaster must decide what skill
(such as marksmanship, melee combat, or throwing) to use to hit, if

Other Magic Systems
Gamemasters allowing magic users created with another
D6 magic system to transfer to this one may ﬁnd it easier
to rely on the rules from that version for those characters
rather than switching to the D6 Fantasy rules.
However, characters using other magic rules may not rely
on the D6 Fantasy rules — and vice versa. Think of each magic
rules set as a diﬀerent and distinct way people manipulate
the esoteric forces of the universe.

Magic
it’s not already built into the spell or described with it, as well as the
appropriate defense, if any. (Gamemasters who prefer to keep activation skills within the arcane arts could allow a separate apportation roll
as the targeting skill.) Attack spells, for example, would use standard
combat diﬃculties and modiﬁers for their defense (regardless of the
targeting skill). Common sense should be used to determine which
skill and defense to use.
Example: With a ﬁreball spell, the gamemaster decides that the
caster has to generate a marksmanship skill total to hit his target. Even
though the ﬁreball will go where he wants it to, there still has to be
some way to determine whether or not anybody is hit by it.
This keeps eﬀects from being automatic “killers.” Granted, most
spells won’t need this — a spell that a character uses to take over a
target’s mind needs no “to hit” total; it is instead the eﬀect versus
the target’s mettle or Charisma.
Casting a spell at the same time as using its targeting or activation
skill is not considered a multi-action. However, if the character wishes
to cast an attack spell, which requires a targeting skill roll, and use a
sword in the same round, then the multi-action modiﬁer of -1D (for
taking two actions in the same round) is applied to the casting roll,
the spell targeting roll, and the weapon targeting roll.
In general, any spell that works like a weapon requires this kind of
control, and a few others might. Gamemasters in doubt may wish to
assign a targeting skill check in addition to the spell skill diﬃculty.

Backlash Option
At the gamemaster’s option, characters who roll a Critical Failure
with an abysmally small skill total becoming disoriented and lose all
of their actions in the next round.

Strain Option
As another means of controlling the use of magic, gamemasters
may choose to increase the diﬃculty to cast spells by 1 for each spell
that the character performs beyond a set number (such as ﬁve or 10)
before the wizard has a chance to rest (generally, ﬁve minutes or so
per spell cast prior to the break).

Applying the Effect
The eﬀect is applied diﬀerently depending on its purpose.
Skill Simulations: Some spells provide the character with skills
or bonuses to skills or attributes. For example, a “healing” spell might
give a character a certain number of dice in healing, and the result of
using the spell’s skill gift would be compared to the normal diﬃculty
for using healing on a target. Any attribute bonuses aﬀect the skills
and specializations under them, and any skill bonuses add to the
specializations under them (if the character has any).
Damage and Protection: The damage from any spell that causes
injury is magical in nature, of course, while protective spells can
defend against it. Thus, creatures and beings that are not normally
aﬀected by standard weapons can be harmed. Of course, unless the
spell includes the appropriate option, nonmagical armor can protect
against magically produced damage.
General Eﬀects: When the spell oﬀers a “general” eﬀect, and
thus has no skill associated with it, the gamemaster will have to make
up levels of success for that spell. A minimal success, with the roll

• Page 85
Untrained Magic
Characters might have spurts of inspiration in areas
in which they have no training. For those who have some
training (that is, pips or dice in any Magic skill), the diﬃculty
increases by +5 to cast a spell using a skill in which they have
no experience. For those who have no training (that is, no pips
or dice in any Magic skill but they do have dice in the Magic
attribute), the diﬃculty increases by +5 for all spell casting
and the character must include one additional Negative Spell
Total Modiﬁer (casting time increase, gesture, community,
etc.) worth two or more. This additional modiﬁer does not
reduce the diﬃculty of the spell, regardless of its level.

equal to the diﬃculty, means that the spell was slightly oﬀ or less
than perfect. A solid success of one to ﬁve points over the diﬃculty
usually gets the spell to do exactly what the caster wants the spell to
do. A superior success of six points over the diﬃculty reveals that the
spell worked better than usual; at this level, the gamemaster might
even provide a bonus to its use.

Result Points
Unless the spell description mentions otherwise, the result points
(the diﬀerence between the spell casting roll and the spell diﬃculty)
applies to one basic aspect of the spell. The magic user must decide
which one — eﬀect, range, or duration — before casting the spell.
Add one-half of the result points as the bonus to the appropriate
value and reﬁgure the value’s measure or die code, if necessary.
(Round fractions up.)

Artifacts & Legends
Every once in a while, the gamemaster will come up with a spell
or magical item that is either too powerful for game balance, or she
doesn’t want to explain how it works for some reason. In that case,
the gamemaster should use the “artifacts and legends” rule.
The gamemaster can simply assign values and diﬃculties to a spell
and state that the spell’s eﬀect is “legendary” or part of an “artifact.”
It only works the way it does because the gamemaster says it does.
She can assign any side eﬀects, rules, or whatever to the special
artifact because it is a truly special case.

Precalculated Spells
The next chapter oﬀers several common spells. You can use them
right away or as inspiration for inventing your own.

Designing the Spell

As you create each spell, you will keep track of a Spell Total and
a Negative Spell Total Modiﬁer. Certain elements, like the value
and the range of the eﬀect, cause the Spell Total to go up (that is,
expand the eﬀect but making it harder to “cast”), while other elements, like gestures or a longer casting time, add to the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁer and (in the end) make the Spell Total go down

Chapter 12

Adjusting & Readjusting
As you design a spell, you can always adjust any aspects
you include, so that you can get the Spell Total (and the spell
diﬃculty) that you want. So, if you decide to add charges to
your wand of power after you’ve created the initial design
but you don’t want the higher diﬃculty, you can go back and
lower the range, increase the casting time, or tinker with
another aspect, until you have a Spell Total you like.

(that is, make the spell’s casting more challenging though, in the
end, easier to cast).
Note that Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers are designated within
the spell design system as negative numbers to distinguish them
from those modiﬁers added to the Spell Total. However, they add to
the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁer total, which is subtracted from the
Spell Total at the end of the design.
You will need a paper and pencil and an active imagination for this
part, so get ready. You can ﬁnd a blank Spell Design Sheet, including a worksheet to help you with the calculations, at the end of this
chapter. A calculator might also help.

Determining the Desired Effect
At this point, write out what you want the spell to do — basically.
What sort of eﬀect are you trying to create? What range will you
need? Will it need charges? How long will the eﬀect last? Consider
all things along these lines. Having some general ideas up front will
help you choose the values of the various aspects of your spell.

Basic Aspects
Use the Spell Worksheet to keep track of the Spell Total and all
modiﬁers, aspects, and your own ideas.

Starting Spell Total & Starting
Negative Spell Total Modifiers
Most Spell Totals begin at zero, but gamemasters who
want magic less common and spells to be more diﬃcult to
cast should have a greater starting Spell Total. Negative Spell
Total Modiﬁers always start at zero.

Effect & Skill Used
One you decide what the spell will do — damage, protection, skill bonus, and so on — determine its corresponding
value using the “Die Code” table or “Spell Measures” table — or
both, if the spell is intended to do more than one thing (such
as create an animated golem). Here are some guidelines.
Damage spells aﬀect character health (that is, their Body
Points or Wounds). To hurt someone, 6D (which you can
determine, by using the “Die Code” table, has a value of 18)
is a safe bet. To kill someone outright, 10D (which has a value
of 30) is usually necessary.
Protection spells work similarly, though, obviously, they
reduce the amount of damage taken. Checking out weapon

• Page 86
damage die codes can help you determine the number of dice you
need for your spell.
Both protection and damage have a visible component (such as a
glowing aura) that indicates their use and, if relevant, trajectory.
Spells that increase, decrease, create, or otherwise aﬀect attributes
or skills are determined the same way. For example, a spell to take
over someone’s mind would give the caster a persuasion of +3D or
more with a value of at least 14.
Spells may not create stand-alone attributes unless they are
included in something that the spell has created (such as a creature).
In this case, use the same level as the stand-alone skill.
Some spells’ eﬀects are best reﬂected by a Special Ability or a
Disadvantage. With a Special Ability, the spell eﬀect’s value equals 3
times the Special Ability cost times the number of ranks in that Special
Ability, plus the cost of any Enhancements and their ranks, minus
the cost of any Limitations and their ranks. With a Disadvantage, the
spell eﬀect’s value equals the 3 times the cost of the Disadvantage.
Spells generally do not provide a target with Advantages or improved
Funds, but the gamemaster may allow this in special circumstances,
such creating a friendship spell using Contacts.
Spell eﬀects that don’t fall into any category should be given a
diﬃculty and the circumstance in which the diﬃculty can be beat.
The diﬃculty equals the eﬀect’s value.
If the spell creates something, refer to the “Spell Measures” table
to determine the spell eﬀect’s value for the desired amount of weight.
Find the desired weight in kilograms, then read over to the corresponding value under the “Val.” column. Most oﬀensive and defensive
spells have a weight value of zero, but the gamemaster may require
exceptionally heavy-duty spells to have a larger weight value.
The spell designer may choose to have certain characteristics of
the spell (such as a golem’s Physique and Body Points or Wounds)
be determined by the points by which the spell skill beats the spell
diﬃculty. (Subtract the spell diﬃculty from the spell skill total to
determine the number of points.) Any attributes ﬁgured this way
have a die code equal to the points above the diﬃculty (minimum

Using the Spell Measures Table
To determine the value for a measure, ﬁnd the amount (in seconds,
kilograms, meters, or meters per second) in the “Measure” column. Then
read across to the number in the “Val.” (value) column.
If the desired amount is greater than one number but less than
another, either lower your amount or select the bigger number.
Use the “Measure Conversions” chart if you have a measure in a
diﬀerent unit; you would like to get it to seconds, kilograms, meters,
or meters per second; and you don’t want to do the math before using
the “Spell Measures” table.
Example: If you want a spell to last for one hour, you look up the
number of hours in the “Measure” column. This gives you an hour value
of 0. To convert this to seconds, which is what is needed for the spell
duration value, add 18 to the hour value (which, in this case, is 0). If
you look up the corresponding measure for 18, you’ll see that it’s 4,000,
which is close enough to the number of seconds in one hour (that is,
3,600 seconds).

of 1D). Body Points equal 10 plus the points above the diﬃculty,
while Wound levels equal the points above the diﬃculty, divided by
2 and rounded up (minimum of one Wound level). There is no cost
for Body Points or Wound levels and the ﬁrst attribute decided with
this method; each additional attribute ups the Spell Total by one.
A spell may contain more than one eﬀect. Each eﬀect is determined
separately and added to the total. All of the eﬀects must fall under
the domain of the same skill. You should also list the skill used to
cast the spell at this time. See the “Skills and Sample Eﬀects” sidebar
for suggestions.
The minimum value for an eﬀect is zero.
Once you decide on a spell eﬀect’s value, write it down. This is the
ﬁrst element of your Spell Total.

Note on Attack & Protection Spells
By default, magical and nonmagical armor can defend against
attack spells. To ignore nonmagical armor, double the value to add
it. Damage is either physical or mental. To do both, each kind must
be purchased separately.
Similarly, protection spells defend against both magical and nonmagical attacks. To be subject to one but not the other, half the value
to add it (round up). The protection may be against physical or mental
attacks. To resist both, each kind must be purchased separately.

Determine how far away you want the caster to be able to aﬀect
things with the spell. Then read the measurement (in meters) on the
“Spell Measures” table to get a range value. Add the value to your
Spell Total.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the mage can use the spell (or its eﬀect,
if the spell was charged into an object) to target anywhere within
that range. The caster can aim at a spot or something mobile (such
as a person or a carriage). If the caster hits a moving target within
the range of the eﬀect, and the target leaves the range of the spell
before it ends, the eﬀect disappears (unless you use the focus optional
aspect, described herein). Even if the target comes back into range
within the spell’s duration, the spell has to be created again.
For purposes of determining the range modiﬁer with ranges
longer than 20 meters, consider anything from three meters up to
one-third of the range to be Short range, anything from one-third
to two-thirds to be Medium range, and anything from two-thirds
to the full range to be Long range. (Round fractions up.) For ranges
of 20 meters or less, distances from three meters to the full range
are Short range.
Example: A spell has a range of 40 meters, which translates to a
Short range of 3 to 14, Medium of 14 to 27, and Long of 27 to 40.
For apportation spells, range indicates either how far away the
target is or how far a target may be sent. If the latter, the target must
be no more than one meter from the caster.

Speed
Speed determines how fast the spell gets from the caster to the
target. First, look at the range value (above). That is the maximum
distance the eﬀect travels. If you select a speed value equal to the
range value, then the spell’s eﬀect travels from the caster to the

Skills & Sample Effects
Here are some typical eﬀects associated with each of the
Magic skills.
Alteration: modiﬁer to a skill or attribute; additional
levels of a Special Ability the target already has; new Limitations or Enhancements on an existing Special Ability; damage
modiﬁer; Armor Value modiﬁer; transmutation. Spells may
not directly aﬀect movement skills.
Apportation: weight of material moved; distance moved;
speed at which target moves; modiﬁers to movement skills
and Move.
Conjuration: amount of material created; new or standalone skills or attributes (skills or attributes that do not modify
an existing skill or attribute); new Disadvantages; new Special
Abilities; skills and attributes included in conjured items;
damage or protection not based on an existing value.
Divination: time in the past or future; stand-alone
investigation, search, or tracking skills to discern speciﬁc
information.

Magic
target in one second, because the speed’s unit of measure is meters
per second.
You can select a lower speed value. Its corresponding measure
indicates how quickly the spell’s eﬀect moves.
To see how long it takes the eﬀect to reach a given target, subtract
the speed value from the range value to the target (not the range value
of the spell). Read the result as a value on the “Spell Measures” table.
The measurement is the number of seconds it takes for the spell’s
eﬀect to go from the caster to the target.
Example: A player decides the range value of his new spell is an
incredible 30 (one million meters, or 1,000 kilometers). She makes
the speed value, however, only 20 (10,000 meters per second, or 10
kilometers per second). The target is 400 kilometers away (a value of
28). The range of 28 minus the speed of 20 gives a result of 8. Reading
this on the “Spell Measures” chart reveals that it takes 40 seconds
(eight rounds) for the eﬀect to reach the target.
Sometimes, you’ll use a lower speed to keep the Spell Total lower.
However, quite often, especially with attack spells, you’ll need that
instantaneous eﬀect. If you build an attack spell with a lower speed,
you have to be aware that the spell will be less accurate — that is, the
target will be able to get out of the way much easier.
The diﬀerence between the speed value and the range value of
the target is added to the target’s defense value or combat diﬃculty
when getting out of the way of a slow attack. So, in the previous
example, not only would it take a value of 8 (40 seconds) to reach
the target, the target would get a bonus of +8 to dodge on the round
that the spell’s eﬀect reaches the area where the caster guessed the
target would be at that time.
A higher speed value than the range value provides no beneﬁt.
Add the speed value onto the Spell Total and keep going.

Duration
Duration indicates how long the eﬀect lasts or continues to act
upon a target. To determine how long the duration is, ﬁnd the time
value on the “Spell Measures” table and add it to the Spell Total. List
the time measure with the spell, leaving it as seconds or converting
it to rounds, minutes, hours, or whatever.
The minimum duration for any spell is one second (or zero value).
Since the duration begins from the moment the spell is cast, the
duration may have to be quite long, especially if it takes a while for
the spell to travel to its target (determined by a lower speed value
than its range value; see the pervious section).

Casting Time
The last of the mandatory elements is casting time. This is the
time the character must spend preparing the spell and performing
any optional aspects (such as rituals, concentration, and so forth).
This time must be spent every time the character casts the spell. The
casting time for a spell cannot be rushed. A magic user may perform
no other actions while casting a spell, unless the cast time is three
seconds (value of 3) or less.
The minimum casting time is zero (one second). Unlike the other
mandatory elements, casting time falls under the Negative Spell
Total Modiﬁers.
Some Notes Regarding Casting Time: For a noncombat spell,
or for a spell that will be built with charges (see the charges optional

• Page 89
Effects & Their Durations
Magic is not a science based on observations of the natural
world. It is an art based on intervening in natural laws. Magical
eﬀects create a reality that temporarily supersede the local
laws of physics. When the magic wears oﬀ, the natural laws
resume. In order for there to be a permanent eﬀect, the altered
reality has to stick around long enough for the natural laws to
take over. As it is much easier to destroy something than to
construct it, damage is instantly permanent while a conjured
item usually disappears when the spell’s duration ends. Thus,
many spells, especially combat spells, may have the minimum
duration because their eﬀects are permanent.
Generally, once a natural process begins to break down the
conjured or altered item, then the magic can return control
of the reality to the local natural laws and the conjured or
altered item will not return to its state before being aﬀected
by magic. Similarly, if it would require more work for nature
to revert an altered item (such as closing an opened door or
lock), then reality concedes the spell’s eﬀect and allows it to
continue past the spell’s duration.

aspect), high casting times are good. The character can spend some
time during or between adventures preparing and casting the spell
and then release it using an activation.
If a character attempts to cast a spell over several days or several
weeks, the physical and mental strain will take their toll on the magic
user. When performing a lengthy ritual, the caster must make a
stamina roll against a diﬃculty of 5 increased by +2 for each day the
character continues the casting time past the ﬁrst day. The gamemaster
may have the character roll each day, or once at the end. Failure of a
stamina roll means that the character could not maintain the ritual
or concentration, and the casting of the spell fails.

Summary
To this point, you have created a basic spell. It has a set eﬀect,
a set duration, and a set casting time. It may be used at any range
up to the maximum and can only aﬀect one speciﬁc target (person,
tree, carriage, spot of ground, etc.). There are no other controls or
modiﬁcations.
If you don’t wish to go any further, add the Negative Spell Total
Modiﬁers to the Spell Total and then divide the total by 2, rounding
up. This is the diﬃculty to cast the spell. See “Final Spell Total” later
in this chapter for restrictions on the Spell Total. Then decide which
Magic skill is necessary to cast the spell. Write these last few things
on the Spell Worksheet, and you’re done.
Of course, there’s so much else you can do with the spell ...

Optional Aspects
The caster may not care about having any options, but without
optional aspects, the spell is pretty limited.
With every optional aspect, the caster must deﬁne exactly what
that particular spell calls for.

Chapter 12
For those optional aspects that include a special roll (such as
certain levels of gestures or incantations), the roll is made at the end
of the casting time and it does not count as a multi-action, though
the roll must be modiﬁed if the magic user is attempting some other,
non-casting-related action in the round.

Area Effect
The eﬀect of the spell travels out from a target. Add the area eﬀect
modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
Adjust the eﬀect by -1 (pip, point of damage, etc.) per full meter
for characters outside of ground zero (within a half-meter of the
target). Compare the targeting roll of spell against the defense total
of characters not at ground zero; those who have a defense total
greater than the targeting roll managed to dive for cover or protect
themselves from the eﬀect.
Example: A spell with a damaging eﬀect and an area eﬀect with
a four-meter radius would do the full damage to between zero and
one-half meter from the target, one point less to characters between
one-half and one meter, two points less to characters between one
and two meters, and so on.
Two-dimensional circle (a few centimeters thick): +1 per halfmeter radius.
Three-dimensional sphere (for explosions and 3D illusions):
+5 per meter radius and +1 bonus to hit one target (bonus is applied
to the same target).
One alternate shape: +1 to area eﬀect modiﬁer.
Several alternate shapes (speciﬁc one chosen at time of casting): +3 to area eﬀect modiﬁer.
Fluid shape (shape may change any time during spell’s duration):
+6 to area eﬀect modiﬁer.

Change Target
The caster can move the spell’s eﬀect to a new target. Add the
change target modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
Only spells with durations of 2.5 seconds or longer may include
this modiﬁer. Changing a target requires a new targeting roll and,
if done within the same round as the ﬁrst targeting roll, incurs a
multi-action penalty. If the old target moves out of range before a
new one is acquired, the spell ends.
Change target: +5 per target (including ﬁrst).
Change target with multi-target (multi-target aspect purchased separately): the change target modiﬁer applies to each multitarget (ex., three change targets with four multi-targets is +60, or +5
times 3 changes times 4 targets).

Charges
The caster ﬁxes the spell in his mind or in an object or another
person. Add the charges modiﬁer (see below for determining it) to
the Spell Total.
The caster need spend the time to cast the spell only once, but if
there is a targeting or activation skill or requirement, then this must be
done each time. The charge goes oﬀ in the round it was activated.
Charges: Look up the number of charges as a measure on the
“Spell Measures” table; the corresponding value is the cost of putting the charges in. (Round fractional measures down; minimum
value of 1.)

• Page 90
Wards: If the charge is activated by a certain set of situations
(speciﬁed at spell casting) — such as a phrase, a condition, or a time
limit — then the charge costs an additional 10% (round up). Should
a speciﬁc skill be able to circumvent the ward, the reduction equals
-1 for a diﬃculty of 20 and an additional -1 for each one point below
the starting diﬃculty. (So a diﬃculty of 15 gives a reduction of -6.)
Only spells that have a speed less than the range (and therefore take
at least one round before the eﬀect occurs) may include wards that
skills can circumvent.
Example: A magic user decides to give his mystic bolt spell ﬁve
charges. This has a value of 4, which is the charge modiﬁer. Should
the mage decide to charge a door frame with the spell, requiring that
anyone who passes through the door sets oﬀ the spell, the charge
modiﬁer becomes 5.

Community
The spell requires helpers in order for it to be cast. Use the accompanying tables to determine the amount to add to the Negative Spell
Total Modiﬁers.
The number of helpers determines the basic community modiﬁer. The “Number of Helpers” is a range of helpers the character has
assisting him. The character must specify when the spell is created
exactly how many helpers are necessary (along with what they must
do and any skills associated with those actions). The tasks must be
reasonable and appropriate to the spell’s eﬀect.
The participation of the helpers is determined by what the helper
actually has to do during the casting time. Decide how much help
the helpers lend (that is, how diﬃcult their tasks are), and multiply

the community modiﬁer by the corresponding participation multiplier. The participants must be able to perform the tasks within
the casting time.
The character creating the spell must declare what type of
actions the helpers must perform. Simple actions include readying
components, chanting mantras, passing tools, and so on.
A participation level with a diﬃculty means that the helpers
actually have to execute some sort of complex action during the
casting — perform a sacriﬁce, dance (and make an acrobatics skill
roll), or whatever. Diﬀerent helpers can be doing diﬀerent things
of the same diﬃculty for this purpose. Multiple groups of helpers
might be performing diﬀerent levels of actions, for multiple community multipliers.
Example: A magic user casts a spell to summon a spirit. There
might be two communities involved. The minor apprentice members
of his guild (a group of 31) might be chanting (a simple action). This
gives a community modiﬁer of 4 (8 times 0.5), while a cadre of four
senior apprentices perform the sacriﬁce of a lamb (diﬃculty 11),
for a modiﬁer of 2 times 1, or 2. These are two separate modiﬁers
worth 4 and 2 respectively, or a total of 6.
When the magic user ﬁnishes the casting time of a communityaided spell, the gamemaster generates a skill total for any communities involved (when necessary). The skill of the community
should be fairly average, unless the gamemaster has reason to
think diﬀerently (the minor apprentices, above, would probably
have artist skills of around 2D+2, while the priests might have melee
combat skill of 3D or so).
Add the diﬃculty modiﬁer to the diﬃculty to determine the chance
of having the entire group succeed (in a mass skill total). So, if the
31 minor apprentices in the above example had to generate a artist:
chanting total of 11 (because they had to chant a long string of words
correctly) using their average skill level (2D+2), the actual diﬃculty
would be 22 (11 + 14). For this reason, it is best if large groups only
participate by performing simple actions.
If the group is a small one (under six), or if the community role is
being performed by players’ characters or speciﬁc gamemaster-controlled characters, however, the skill totals can be made separately.
No diﬃculty modiﬁer should be added to the community diﬃculty
when the skill totals are ﬁgured separately. If any community group
or member of a community fails in his skill total, the entire spell
does not work.
Character Points and Fate Points may only be spent from individual character pools on their own rolls. They may not be spent on
“group” rolls.
The “Community” table is based on the “Spell Measures” table, so
you can extend the modiﬁers accordingly. To get the diﬃculty modiﬁer,
multiply the “base modiﬁer” by 2 and subtract 2 from that.
Example: A spell that use 1,000 apprentices would yield a bonus
of +15. The diﬃculty modiﬁer would be +28 (15 x 2 = 30 -2 = 28).

Components
The spell requires one or more items or needs to be done in a certain
location in order for the eﬀect to go oﬀ. The items or location should
be representative of the spell’s eﬀect. Use the accompanying table to

concentration time. If the character fails the mettle roll, the spell fails.
A Critical Failure on the mettle roll indicates that the caster takes any
feedback associated with the spell, even though it didn’t work.

Countenance
The caster’s body changes in response to the use of magic. Some go
pale or even blue with a lack of blood ﬂow to their skin, others shake
uncontrollably or foam at the mouth, still others get bulging eyes or
swollen lolling tongues. This alteration in appearance lasts until the
end of the spell’s duration. Use the accompanying tables to determine
the amount to add to the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers.
Nothing unreal can happen here: no glowing eyes, no ﬂames from
nostrils, no unearthly aura, except as a psychic illusion that only the
target can see. The drawback to an illusory change is that, no matter
what the victim’s perceptions and predispositions were before the fact,
after the image is seen, the victim is forever ﬁrmly convinced that the
caster is an inhuman monster. Only those already endowed with a
psychic or magic ability are capable of accepting that image for what
it truly is. Psychic illusions may be used only with living targets.

modiﬁer to the Spell Total. If there is a diﬃculty listed, the character
must make an acrobatics or sleight of hand roll against that diﬃculty
at the end of the casting time.

Incantation
The caster, a charge, or a ward requires that a word or phrase
be said so that the spell will work. Use the accompanying tables
to determine the modiﬁer to the Spell Total. If there is a diﬃculty
listed, the character must make an artist or persuasion roll against
that diﬃculty at the end of the casting time.

Multiple Targets
The caster can place the exact same spell on more than one target
(but not the same target multiple times) without having to cast the
spell separately for each target. Add the multiple targets modiﬁer to
the Spell Total. Each target must be within the spell’s range.
If a targeting skill roll is required by the spell, using it on multiple
targets is not considered a multi-action. If the diﬃculties to hit each
target are within three points of each other, the caster need roll
only once. If it’s greater than this, each target requires a separate
targeting roll.
Multi-target: +3 per target (including ﬁrst target; ex., three
targets is +9).

Focused
When a spell is “focused” on a target, it stays with the target until
the duration has ended. Add the focused modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
The range of the spell, then, only determines how far away the
target can be from the caster. Damage spells that are focused on a
target do the same damage each round.
Focused: (value of eﬀect + value of duration)/5, round down,
minimum of +1, per target.
Example: A spell’s eﬀect is 5D in damage, so the eﬀect has a value
of 15, and the spell has a duration of 10 seconds (two rounds), so
the duration has a value of 5. The cost of the focused optional aspect
is (15 + 5)/5, or +4.

that the spell will work. Use the accompanying tables to determine the

attribute — otherwise, he slips into an
irreversible coma and dies.
Warning: Do not overuse this modiﬁer. Once the players are clued into what the gamemaster is doing,
she’ll never get another illusionary spell through on them. The best
way to use this is to have a nasty gamemaster character mage research
a number of spells two ways, as both “real” eﬀect and “unreal.” He then
casts the illusionary versions (with the lower diﬃculty number) until
someone ﬁgures out they’re not real. Then, just for fun, he switches.
Imagine the look on the player’s faces when their characters charge
through the “illusionary” wall of ﬁery death and ﬁnd out it’s a bit more
substantial than they ﬁrst thought. It’ll drive them nuts.
There are a few things to remember when casting unreal eﬀects. The
spell does not aﬀect the caster. He knows it’s illusionary. So a character
can’t make an unreal bridge over a ravine and walk across it. Using
the same example, if someone other than the caster believed in the
bridge, they could walk across it, maybe. They would unconsciously
use any means at their disposal to cross the chasm without realizing
it. If they couldn’t locate a way, they would ﬁnd some reason that
they could not cross the bridge. An illusionary bridge doesn’t allow
people to walk on air, nor can it cause people to jump oﬀ a cliﬀ and
die without realizing it.

When a caster adds this optional aspect to a spell, it
causes the eﬀect of the spell to be illusory. The eﬀects
are not real — they are just perceived as real.
The special eﬀect is automatically believed unless
a target or an observer actually states otherwise.
Then, depending on the disbelief diﬃculty (see the
accompanying table), the illusion may lose all of its eﬀects. The
easier an illusion is to disbelieve, the more the modiﬁer is worth
(the “Modiﬁer Multiplier”).
Since the eﬀect is what is being tampered with, the spell eﬀect’s
value directly controls how much the modiﬁer can be worth.
Start with the spell eﬀect’s value, determined way back in “Eﬀect
& Skill Used.” Then, when you decide how hard it is for a character
to disbelieve the illusion, multiply the eﬀect’s value by the modiﬁer
multiplier. Round up. The resulting number is added to the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁers.
Example: You decide that your ﬁreball with a damage of 10D,
which has a value of 30, is an illusionary eﬀect with a disbelief difﬁculty of 0. You multiply 30 by the Modiﬁer Multiple of 0.75 for a
result of 22.5 (rounds up to 23).
The guidelines for disbelief are as follows:
• Any player’s character can disbelieve at any time he sees a spell’s
eﬀect occur but, if the eﬀect was used during a conﬂict round, this
counts as an action.
• Gamemaster characters should only disbelieve when the gamemaster thinks it is appropriate, or when the character using the spell
uses it quite often (and eﬀectively).
• When a character disbelieves, he generates a Acumen or investigation total. If the total is equal to or higher than the disbelief diﬃculty,
he is successful. The spell has no aﬀect on him whatsoever — it does
not disappear, but any eﬀects it had do not apply to him.
• If a character is encouraged to disbelieve by another character who
has successfully disbelieved (and who he trusts or who can persuade
him), he gains +4 to his Acumen or investigation total.
• A character who has disbelieved a spell will not believe in the
eﬀect later if it comes from the same source in the same way (i.e., if
the character disbelieves the eﬀect of a particular wand of power, that
wand of power will never be eﬀective against him again, but he may
or may not believe in other magical wands).
• The character who uses or creates the spell knows it is an illusion
and can never be inﬂuenced by its eﬀect.
• The gamemaster can, and should, apply diﬃculty modiﬁers to
the disbelief diﬃculty based on how believable (or ridiculous) the
spell seems to be.
• In the event a character takes damage or suﬀers some sort of
debilitating eﬀect from an illusion that would, logically, disappear
after he disbelieves the illusion, it does.
Example: If a character falls into a “trap” and takes damage from
falling, and then ﬁnds out the whole pit was an illusion, he’ll be

Variable Duration

The caster may turn on and oﬀ the spell as many times as desired
before the duration expires. Add the variable duration modiﬁer to
the Spell Total.
The duration lasts from the time the spell is cast until the duration time is up, regardless of the number of times or how long the
spell is turned on or oﬀ.
Oﬀ-only: +4.
On/oﬀ switch: +8.
Extended duration (separate from oﬀ-only and switch; extended
duration time measure — not value — added at spell casting if desired):
For every +1 of extended duration, the time may be increased by the
equivalent measure for that number of points. For example, +1 allows
the caster to extend the duration by 1.5 seconds, while +9 allows a
duration extension of 60 seconds.

Variable Effect
The caster may change the amount of the spell’s eﬀect when he
casts the spell. Add the variable eﬀect modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
Raising and lowering the eﬀect’s amount (die code or bonus) add to
the Spell Total separately. Be sure to specify in the spell’s description
the maximum or minimum eﬀect. If the spell has multiple eﬀects,
each variable eﬀect must be purchased separately for each eﬀect
(though not all eﬀects need have the same variable eﬀect aspect, if
they have it at all).
Variable eﬀect: +1 for every pip or point per direction per eﬀect.
(There are three pips in one die.)

Chapter 12

Variable Movement
The caster can control the movement of the spell’s eﬀect. Add the
variable movement modiﬁer to the Spell Total.
Accuracy bonus: +2 for each +1 bonus to the targeting skill
total.
Bending: +1 to bend around obstacles smaller than the target;
+3 to bend around obstacles the same size or smaller than the target;
+4 to use the eﬀect to ﬁnd a target the caster can’t see (though the
spell may no aﬀect the target); +5 to send the spell after a target the
caster can’t see, although the caster gets a +4D (+12) modiﬁer to the
targeting diﬃculty.
Movement of eﬀect: To move a spell associated with a target
(such as a ﬂight or telekinesis spell), or to make an otherwise stationary eﬀect move (such as an illusion), the spell needs this optional
aspect. Determine the desired speed measure (in meters per second)
and its corresponding value on the “Spell Measures” table and add 1
to it; this is the cost of the movement of eﬀect aspect.

Other Alterants
A spell might involve an expansion of its eﬀect
not related to one of the other aspects presented
herein. Use the accompanying table to decide how
much the alterant changes the spell and add the
related modiﬁer to the Spell Total.

Other Conditions
There might be other circumstances the spell
requires in order to work. Compare the condition
concept to the accompanying table to determine the
amount to add to the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers.

Final Spell Total & Spell Difficulty
Once you have determined all of the factors involved with casting
the spell, add the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers to the Spell Total
to get the Final Spell Total. Then divide the Final Spell Total by 2,
rounding up. This is the diﬃculty the caster must meet or beat with
the appropriate Magic skill.

Minimum Spell Total
Negative Spell Total modiﬁers may not reduce the positive Spell
Total to lower than 20 for most spells, making the spell diﬃculty
no less than 10.

Cantrips
Cantrips, also known as glamours, are small, simple, everyday
spells. They may have maximum Final Spell Totals of 10 and minimum
diﬃculties of 2. Their duration values must be 9 (one minute) or
less and their casting values must be 4 (one round) or less. Cantrips
may not have the following optional aspects: change target, charges,
community, focused, or variable eﬀect. Components may only be
of the ordinary, very common, or common variety, though, if the
player can make a good case for it, the gamemaster may allow
a component of a higher level that is not destroyed to be used
(such as a personal staﬀ or ring). Gestures and incantations may
oﬀer no more than a -2 modiﬁer each, and no cantrip may have
more than one of each. Modiﬁers from “other conditions” may
oﬀer no more than a -2 adjustment.

Design Time
A player who learns this magic system can probably come up with
a basic spell in a matter of minutes. The gamemaster can review it
quickly, and it can be used right away.
Well, not exactly. The character has to spend time working out
the spell, too. He has to experiment, do trial and error, and come up
with the eﬀect — or risk blowing himself up. The amount of time it
takes to design a spell has nothing to do with the amount of time
it takes to cast it.
To ﬁgure out the base design time, look up the spell diﬃculty in the
“Val.” column of the “Spell Measures” table. Read across to the “Measures” column to determine the number of seconds that the spell takes
to design. (Divide this number by 5 to get the number of rounds, or 60
to get the number of minutes, or 3,600 to get the number of hours.)
Design times of less than ﬁve seconds round up to ﬁve seconds.

The condition will not occur without the caster taking elaborate measures, or requires a skill roll of diﬃculty 17–19
-5
The condition is rare and almost totally (or totally) out of the caster’s control, or requires a skill roll of diﬃculty 20 or more -6

Magic
The character may rush the design, but this increases the difﬁculty (not the Final Spell Total) of casting the spell. The minimum
design time that may be rushed is 10 seconds. The diﬃculty increases
depending on how much less time the character puts into the task:
+5 for 25% less time, +10 for 50% less time, and +20 for 75% less
time. A character may not perform any task in less than 75% of the
normally needed time. Thus, to rush an hour-long design time into
30 minutes, the diﬃculty increases by +10.
Taking any other actions while designing the spell increases
the amount of time to make it. Usually, it takes twice as long, but
gamemasters should adjust this up or down, depending on the circumstances of the distraction.
Characters remaking a spell they previously designed or working
from spell in a book or on a scroll can cut their time in half, though
the design time minimum of ﬁve seconds still applies.
There is no roll to design a spell, though there certainly could be
an adventure in ﬁnding the right components or the perfect location
to cast the spell.

Starting Spells
By default, a character may start with any number of spells,
though some require more eﬀort and components than others to
cast. Some gamemasters may wish to restrict the number of starting spells to ones that the magic user has speciﬁcally “learned.” The
more that magic abounds in the setting, the more the novice user
should have, but three spells per skill per full die in it would generally
serves most settings.

Spell Design in Action
Geoﬀ decides to create a basic ﬁre missile spell, since he doesn’t
see anything like that in the precalculated spells in this book. Once
he decides on the value of an aspect, he writes it on the Spell Difﬁculty Worksheet.
Starting Spell Total: In this setting, the gamemaster has decided
that spells aren’t easier or more diﬃcult to cast than average, so the
starting Spell Total is zero.
Starting Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers: The Negative Spell
Total Modiﬁers always start at zero. Geoﬀ knows that, although
they are listed as negative numbers, these modiﬁers will add to the
Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers total.
Eﬀect: Geoﬀ decides that he doesn’t want to make a spell that’s
too powerful (and too diﬃcult to cast), so he picks 3D as the amount
of damage the missile spell does. He only wants it to do physical
damage. Using the “Die Codes” chart, he ﬁgures that this has a value
of 9. He writes this on line 1 of the worksheet.
Spell’s Skill: At this time, he also picks the skill needed to cast
the spell. Since it has to do the creation of something, this spell falls
under conjuration.
Range: Looking on the “Spell Measures” table, Geoﬀ selects 15
under the “Measure” column, which has a value of 6. Since the base
measure for distance is meters, the range becomes 15 meters. Geoﬀ
writes “6” on line 2.
Speed: Geoﬀ doesn’t want a delay, so he makes the speed equal
to the range and writes “6” on line 3.

• Page 95

Duration: As this is simply
a tiny missile, it doesn’t need to
last long. Again using the “Spell
Measures” table, this time keeping
in mind the measure is in seconds,
Geoﬀ thinks that 3.5 seconds is
long enough. He writes its value
of 3 on line 4.
Casting Time: Geoﬀ wants the
caster to do this quickly, so, referring to the “Spell Measures” table,
he decides on a time of 1.5 seconds.
This allows the caster to perform
it in the same round as its eﬀect.
This is his ﬁrst Negative Spell Total
Modiﬁer, so he writes the casting
time’s value of 1 in the bottom of
the worksheet, on line 5.
Optional Aspects: Geoff
decides at this point to skip the
optional aspects — he’s in a hurry.
He writes “0” on lines 6 through 23
of the worksheet.
Finishing the Spell: Geoﬀ ﬁrst
adds the lines related to the Spell
Total and gets 24. Then she adds
the lines dealing with the Negative
Spell Total Modiﬁers and gets 1. He
subtracts 1 from 24 to get 23. Dividing this by 2 and rounding up, she
ﬁnds that the diﬃculty to cast this
spell is 12. Geoﬀ realizes, because
of the rounding, he could go back
and add 1 to the damage, which
would give him, after subtracting
the Negative Spell Total Modiﬁers,
an even 24 to divide. He decides
that he’ll do that next time.
Design Time: Geoﬀ wants to
ﬁnd out how quickly his mage can
use the new spell. He looks up the
spell diﬃculty of 12 on the “Spell
Measures” chart to ﬁnd the equivalent measure of 250. He divides this
by 5 to get the number of rounds
(which is 50 rounds) and by 60 to
get the number of minutes (which
is about four minutes). Good thing
he thought of this before his caster
would need it!

CHAPTER XIII

• Precalculated Spells •
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter oﬀers a sampling of spells created with the spelldesign system in the previous chapter. Use them as is, or be inspired
by them in making new spells. See “Characteristics of a Spell” on page
84 for details on how to read the spell listings.
All spells were designed with a starting Spell Total of zero, so basic
and additional aspects were added to the eﬀect’s value.

Cantrips
Charm
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 5
Eﬀect: 18 (charm skill bonus of +4D)
Range: Self (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gesture (-2): Smile and make a gesture of welcome or admiration
Unreal Eﬀect (-9): Diﬃculty to disbelieve is 13
Other Conditions (-2): May only be used on humanoids who
understand the caster’s language and can hear the caster
With a smile and a friendly gesture, the caster improves his charm
skill by for one minute. (If he no charm skill, add the bonus to the
character’s Charisma attribute.) As this is an illusory spell, if the
intended target of the charm disbelieves it, any eﬀect the charm
attempt had wears oﬀ immediately.

Heighten Attribute (Template)
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 3
Eﬀect: 6 (+1D bonus to one non-Extranormal attribute)
Range: 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Gesture (-3): Mime an activity using a skill that falls under the
attribute to be heightened (complex, action diﬃculty of 11; examples:
sleight of hand for Coordination, lifting for Physique)
This cantrip gives the target a bonus of +1D to one of his attributes
for 25 seconds, or ﬁve rounds — as long as he doesn’t move more
than a meter from the spot on which he received the bonus.

Note that this is only a template for a spell and not an actual
spell, because it does not indicate in the description which attribute
is aﬀected. The caster must specify which attribute and skill to mime
before learning the spell (which takes one round).

Open Lock
Skill Used: Apportation
Diﬃculty: 5
Eﬀect: 18 (compare to diﬃculty to open lock)
Range: 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): Large metal key (common)
Gesture (-2): Mime opening the lock with the key (fairly simple)
Incantation (-2): “Open, Lock, and reveal your secrets.” (sentence)
Other Conditions (-1): Physical contact with lock

Chapter 13
To cast this cantrip, the mage touches the lock with one hand
while, with the key held in it, miming opening the lock with the other
hand. After reciting the incantation, he touches the lock with the key
and turns the key. If the spell eﬀect’s value is equal to or greater than
the diﬃculty of the lock, it opens. If there are any traps or wards on
the lock, they are not circumvented by this spell! Note that this spell
works on any kind of mechanical lock.

Alteration Spells
Countermagic
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 19
Eﬀect: 29 (compare to skill total of spell countering)
Range: 60 meters (+9)
Speed: +9
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Concentration (-1): 3 seconds with mettle diﬃculty of 7
Gesture (-1): Wave hand through air as if wiping away something
(simple)
Incantation (-3): “Your hold is broken!” (sentence, said loudly)
Other Conditions (-4): One spell, which the caster must specify
when casting this spell
The caster concentrates on the spell he wishes to counter, waving
his hand and shouting the required incantation. The eﬀect’s value
plus the result points bonus are compared to the skill total used to
create the targeted spell. If the countermagic number is equal to or
higher than the target spell’s skill total, the spell is broken.

Countermagic Ward
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 11
Eﬀect: 29 (compare to skill total of spell countering)
Range: Self or a target within 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 25 minutes (-16)
Other Aspects:
Charges (+6): 6 charges, with a ward to go oﬀ when a spell “hits”
the target
Concentration (-4): 10 minutes with mettle diﬃculty of 10
Focused (+6): On target
Gesture (-1): Wave hand through air as if wiping away something
(simple)
Incantation (-3): “Let no spell touch me!” (sentence, said
loudly)
Similar to the countermagic spell, this spell gives the target a general protection against spells. It is triggered by a spell “hitting” the
target. Up to six spells can be countered in this fashion. The eﬀect’s
value plus result points bonus are compared to the skill total used
to create the targeted spell. If the countermagic ward number is equal
to or higher than the target spell’s skill total, the spell is broken.
Regardless of the success of the ward, one charge is lost.

Deadly Dart
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 11
Eﬀect: 18 (+4D in damage)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: +10
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 40 minutes (-17)
Other Aspects:
Charges (+1): 1 charge
Components (-11): Black obsidian (uncommon, destroyed), dart
(common)
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Focused (+5)
Gesture (-1): Rub the tip of the bullet on the stone (simple)
Incantation (-1): “Darkness of death.” (a few words)
Variable Movement (+4): +2 accuracy bonus
This spell uses a piece of black obsidian to increase the deadliness
of a dart. The mage utters a short, dark phrase while gently stroking
the tip of the dart across the stone. The darkness travels into the
dart, draining the stone of its pigment.
To release the spell, the caster throws the dart within ﬁve rounds
of casting the spell. He generate an marksmanship total, adding a +2
bonus for the increased accuracy of the spell, against the combat difﬁculty for the target. The target must be within range of the spell, or
the dart merely does its normal eﬀect. The target takes an additional
4D in damage in the round the dart hits and for the next four rounds.
The spell ends if the target moves beyond the spell’s range.

Fear
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 19
Eﬀect: 30 (intimidation skill bonus at +6D+2)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: +10
Duration: 2.5 minute (+11)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): An item owned for at least a month by the
target (very rare)
Gesture (-1): Point item at target (simple)
Incantation (-1): Frightening words (a few words)
Unreal Eﬀect (-8): Diﬃculty to disbelieve is 13
To cast the spell, the mage ﬁrst needs something belonging to
her target — his comb, his watch, a lock of his hair. Mutter a few
words of power, point the item at the target, and watch the fun. This
spell gives the caster an intimidation skill bonus of +6D+2, but only
towards that target. The target may disbelieve it with a Charisma or
mettle roll of 13.

Water Spray
Skill Used: Alteration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 12 (4D damage)
Range: 15 meters (+6)
Speed: +6

Precalculated Spells
Duration: 3 rounds (+6)
Cast Time: 5 seconds (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-6): Liter of water (ordinary, destroyed), squeezable container (uncommon)
The mage needs a liter of water in a container that she can
squeeze to produce a spray. As she casts the spell, the mage squirts
the water onto her hand, letting it run oﬀ in the direction of her
target. The volume and force behind the water spray increases
dramatically. The spray lasts for three rounds of combat. The
spell does 4D in damage per round and requires a marksmanship
roll each round to hit the target. The caster may only select one
target per spell duration.

Apportation Spells
Alter Movement
Skill Used: Apportation
Diﬃculty: 15
Eﬀect: 4 (1 meter per round)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: +7
Duration: 4 minutes/50 rounds (+12)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+2): On target
Gesture (-2): Point at target, then make running motion with
ﬁngers (fairly simple)
Incantation (-2): First say, “I command your speed,” followed
by whether the target should slow or quicken (sentence)
Variable Eﬀect (+5): Caster may increase eﬀect’s value by up
to 5 points on the “Spell Measures” chart
Other Alterant (+1): At time of casting, mage may choose to
speed up or slow down target (small)
The caster makes her target either hurry up or slow down,
depending on how she words her command. The target’s movement
is altered by the measure of the spell eﬀect’s value plus any result
points bonus (as read on the “Spell Measures” chart).
Example: A magic user casts the alter movement spell to slow
down a charging bull. At casting time, he decided to use the spell
eﬀect’s value plus the full variable amount, for a minimum change
value of 9, or 60 meters per second (12 meters per round). If his
skill total was one point over the diﬃculty, the new change value
would be 10, or 100 meters per second (10 meters per round).
This rate would then be subtracted from the bull’s current movement rate, causing the raging animal to come to a complete and
shockingly sudden stop.

Carrying Wind

Scrivened Spells
Scrivened spells are spells triggered by reading them. Most
commonly written on a single sheet of paper or parchment, any
surface will do.
Almost any spell that doesn’t involve charges, a ward, or a
component that’s enhanced because of the spell (such as deadly
dart or mystical shield) may be set down as a scrivened spell. They
are usable once by anyone who reads the spell, even those with
no magical ability. The scrivened spell scribe performs all of the
requisite aspects; the spell releaser is bound by the skill required
to use the spell (such as a targeting skill) and most of its aspects,
except casting time, community, concentration, components,
feedback, gestures, incantations, and other conditions requiring
the releaser to do something. (The wizard has already performed
these requirements.)
The scribe of the spell may not use a scrivened spell that he
created.
The following aspects for a scroll spell are added to any required
by the spell:
• Charge (+2): 1 charge with ward, spell released when the
description is read
• Components (-6): sheet of paper (common); ink (common)
• Concentration (-3): 4 minutes with mettle diﬃculty of 9
• Gestures (-2): Write a brief description of the spell on the
paper
Scroll spell modiﬁer (total value of above new aspects):
-9
The casting time might also need adjusting.

Using the chart, determine the new time. Subtract the old
time’s value from the new time’s value. Add this number to the
scroll spell modiﬁer of -9. Divide the new total by 2. Reduce the
spell diﬃculty by this number to get the new spell diﬃculty. The
minimum diﬃculty for a scrivened spell is 5 (which is lower than
the normal minimum diﬃculty).
Example: Evil eye curse has a casting time of two rounds, which
has a value of 5, and a diﬃculty of 11. Using the chart to determine
the new casting time, the player notes that it’s now four minutes
10 seconds with a value of 12. Subtracting 5 from 12 gets 7. Adding
this to the scrivened spell modiﬁer gets 16. Dividing by 2 gives a
modiﬁer of 8. The diﬃculty for a evil eye curse scrivened spell is 5
(11 - 8 = 3, with a minimum of diﬃculty of 5).
Players may use these guidelines to create scrivened spells from
scratch, with a minimal spell diﬃculty of 5.

Chapter 13
Cast Time: 1 hour (-18)
Other Aspects:
Area Eﬀect (+15): 3-meter sphere
Charges (+4): 6 charges
Component (-4): May only be cast outdoors, in a clear area (ordinary), mage wears loose clothes (common)
Feedback (-8): points of damage
Gesture (-2): Mimic a ﬁght (fairly simple)
Incantation (-2): “I subdue you and I command you, O wind!”
(sentence)
Variable Movement (+7): 25 meters per second
This is a charged spell. To cast it, the mage goes outside and starts
running, jumping, and mimicking ﬂight. The mage should be wearing
something loose that can catch the wind. One cast garners the mage
six charges of the spell.
When released, the spell causes a wind to rise and lifts the mage
into the air. The mage can control the direction of the wind and its
speed (up to 25 meters a round). The spell can carry as if it had a
lifting of 5D.
The wind forms a three-meter sphere around the mage’s body,
and nothing can be carried that won’t ﬁt in that sphere.

Relocate Person
Skill Used: Apportation
Diﬃculty: 14
Eﬀect: 11 (teleport up to 150 kilograms)
Range: 100 meters (+10)
Speed: +10
Duration: 1.5 rounds (+1)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Charge (+2): 3 charges
Gesture (-2): Point to target then point in direction of new location (fairly simple)
Incantation (-1): “Go there.” (one or two words)
After the mage casts the spell, she has ﬁrmly ﬁxed in her mind
three uses of it. When she releases the spell, she points at her
intended target, which will be instantly teleported to the range of
the spell. The result points bonus may be added either to the value of
the weight transported or the distance traveled; read the new value
on the “Spell Measures” chart. The spell will not allow anything to
appear inside a solid object. Remember that a target who is aware
of the potential relocation may roll her Physique or lifting and add it
to her weight. The caster’s spell roll must then beat that diﬃculty as
well as the spell’s diﬃculty.
Note: A similar spell, relocate item, is identical in every way except
that the eﬀect is to carry an item weighing no more than 10 kilograms,
with a value of 5, and thus the diﬃculty is 11.

Conjuration Spells
Cage

Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 27
Eﬀect: 25 (resistance total of bars)
Range: 25 meters (+7)

• Page 100
Speed: +7
Duration: 1 hour (+18)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area Eﬀect (+15): Sphere with a radius of 3 meters
Gesture (-3): Mime escaping from a cell, then point to target
(complex; acrobatics roll with diﬃculty of 11)
Unreal Eﬀect (-7): Disbelief diﬃculty of 13
Cage traps a target in a prison of magical energy. To cast it, the
wizard mimics trying to escape from a cell, then points at her target.
If a marksmanship total beats the combat diﬃculty for the target, the
quarry is trapped. The cage is a sphere with a radius of three meters.
Creatures larger than that can’t be conﬁned by this spell.
The eﬀect’s value plus the result points bonus serves as the damage
resistance total of the bars. The target can disbelieve and thus free
himself by generating a Acumen or investigation total of 13.

Communicate with Animals
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 15 (speaking skill with specialization in the animal’s “language” at 5D)
Range: 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 6 minutes (+13)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Something from the type of
animal with which she wants to communicate (very common)
Gesture (-2): Draw a line on the ground (fairly simple)
To communicate with an animal, the caster places on the ground
the bit of something from that type of animal (lock of horse’s hair,
bird’s feather, several strands of dog’s hair). Then she draws a line
from it to her and from it in the direction of the animal or animals
she wishes to speak to. For about six minutes, she receives the ability to communicate with any of that kind of animal as if she had a
specialization in its language at 5D. She may add the result points
bonus to her speaking roll total. The caster may not move more than
one meter from the casting location.

Evil Eye Curse
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 11
Eﬀect: 6 (Bad Luck (R2) Disadvantage)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: +5
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+4): On target
Feedback (-3): -3 to damage resistance total
Concentration (-2): 1 round with mettle diﬃculty of 8
Other Condition (-3): Limited to Humans
With a minimal amount of pain to himself, the caster curses a
Human target that she can see with 10 minutes of Bad Luck (R2).

Precalculated Spells
See the description of this Disadvantage in the “Character Options”
chapter for details.

Glow Stone
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 12 (negates up to -4D of darkness modiﬁer)
Range: Touch (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Area Eﬀect (+5): Sphere with radius of one meter
Components (-4): white pebble (common, destroyed)
Focused (+5): On pebble
Gesture (-1): Hold pebble between thumb and forefinger
(simple)
Incantation (-2): “Stone of white, give us light.” (sentence)
The magic user casts this spell on a small, white stone, making it
glow with a ﬁerce radiance that extends for one meter in all directions around the pebble. The eﬀect lasts for 10 minutes. Once the
duration wears oﬀ, the pebble turns to dust.

Feast

Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 4 (5 kilograms of food and water)
Range: 1 meter (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 4 hours (+21)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-6): A plain, cloth napkin (common), a small metal
cup (common)
Focused (+4), on people who eat food
Gesture (-2): Wave hand several times over napkin and cup (fairly
simple)
Other Alterants (+3), clean water and hearty food
With this cantrip, the mage creates a meal for two of pure, clean
water; ﬂavorful, hearty bread; fresh vegetables and fruits; and, if
desired, cheese wedges and smoked meat slices. The food must be
consumed within 10 minutes of its appearance, so that it has a chance
to stay in the body long enough to be digested and actually provide
nourishment. The result points bonus increases the amount of food
appearing or (at the gamemaster’s discretion) the quality of food.

Mystic Bolt
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 12 (4D in damage)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: +5
Duration: 3.5 seconds (+3)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Gesture (-2): Swirl hand in air as if gathering energy, then
throw it at target (fairly simple)
Incantation (-2): “Ah!” (word, said loudly)
The mage gathers energy from his surroundings and throws the ball
at a target. It does 4D in damage at a range of up to 10 meters. He
must make a marksmanship roll to hit the target. The bolt must
be ﬁred in the same round that the mage casts the spell.

Mystical Shield
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 10
Eﬀect: 18 (Armor Value of 6D)
Range: 1.5 meters (+1)
Speed: +1
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Area eﬀect (+2): One-meter radius
Components (-10): A simple ring (uncommon), handful of colored
sand (common, destroyed)
Focused (+5): On ring
Gesture (-2): Using colored sand, scribe an oval shape in the air
(fairly simple)

Chapter 13
Incantation (-1): “Protection!” (word)
By tossing some sand in a circle in front of her, the caster creates a
semi-transparent oval shield of the same color as the sand. The shield,
about two meters in diameter, appears up to 1.5 meters away. It is
focused on the ring, which the mage must wear. It oﬀers an Armor
Value of 6D against all types of physical (not mental) attacks.

Stunned Senseless
Skill Used: Conjuration
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 15 (6D+2 stun damage)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: +5
Duration: 3.5 seconds (+3)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Gesture (-2): Point ﬁnger and then palm at intended target (fairly
simple)
Incantation (-1): “Stop!” (word)
With a gesture and a word, the magic user sends a bolt of mystical
energy toward his intended target. However, the bolt isn’t intended
to harm the target, instead only doing stun damage.

Divination Spells
Detect the Living
Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 14
Eﬀect: 24 (search of 8D to locate a single type of creature)
Range: Self
Speed: 0
Duration: 10 seconds (+5)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area eﬀect (+20): 10-meter radius circle
Component (-12): Something from the type of creature being
detected (uncommon, destroyed); ﬁre, such as a match or lit coal
(very common, destroyed)
Concentration (-3): 25 seconds with a mettle diﬃculty of 9
Gesture (-1): Inhale smoke (simple)
Variable Movement (+4): Bending (can’t see target)
Before throwing the spell, the caster should decide what sort of being
she’s looking for, because she’ll need a piece of it for the spell to work
(a lock of hair from a Human, fur or fangs from an animal, etc.).
The caster sets the object on ﬁre and inhales the smoke while concentrating. Once the casting is done, the mage can detect the presence
of any such being within a 10-meter radius for two rounds. The higher
the search skill total is above the diﬃculty, the more information the
caster knows about the beings she seeks (such as location, number,
gender, etc.). The diﬃculty starts at 10 for a Human-sized creature,
and goes down for larger creatures, up for smaller ones, and up for
the number of other types of creatures in the area.

• Page 102
Scrying

Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 11
Eﬀect: 34 (2.5 months)
Range: Scrying object (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
Components (-9): Scrying tool with images or symbols (tarot cards,
playing cards, runes, etc. ) (uncommon); item the person owned for
at least a month or the person herself (very rare)
Gesture (-6): Randomize the tool and place parts of the tool in
a set pattern (fairly simple); interpret the symbols (very complex,
scholar diﬃculty of 15)
Other Conditions (-1): Physical contact with tool
By interpreting cards or runes, the diviner gains a sense of what
the future holds for the person who the reading is about. The mage
may choose to look for a condition that could occur up to two and
a half months into the future. She can see one minute’s worth of
the future. Use the result points of the divination roll to determine
how much information she receives: Zero points reveals confusing
images. One to four points allows one useful fact to be gleaned from
the reading. Five to eight points tells the mage a few useful facts,
including the time of the occurrence. Nine to 12 points allows the
mage to note more details, including time and location. Thirteen
or more points lets the mage see the scene as if she were present,
though in shades of gray.

Sense Past
Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 25
Eﬀect: 38 (66 weeks in past)
Range: Touch (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 66 minutes (+18)
Casting Time: 25 minutes (-16)
Other Aspects:
Area eﬀect (+25): Sphere with radius of 5 meters
Concentration (-5): 10 minutes with a mettle diﬃculty of 11
Components (-9): Magnifying glass (uncommon), expensive
pocket watch (very rare)
Countenance (-1): Skin turns sickly gray color for duration of
spell
Other Conditions (-1): Physical contact with object
The mage can learn about the past of a single object he touches.
He’ll see visions of events that occurred in a ﬁve-meter radius around
the object in the past. The mage can view events that took place in
a past period of time whose value (as read on the “Spell Measures”
table) is less than or equal to the eﬀect’s value plus the result points
bonus. The mage can scan back to that period at a rate of one week’s
worth of images per minute of the spell.

CHAPTER XIV

• Miracles •
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter covers the ability to call upon a higher power for
extraordinary eﬀects. The Miracles skills are available only to characters with the Miracles Extranormal attribute.
Although this chapter discusses guidelines for creating miracles,
gamemasters may still include uninvoked divine intervention and
miraculous artifacts. Since these sorts of divine intervention don’t
have to be explained — they just are — their use is out of the players’ characters’ control. Only the gamemaster can decide the cause
and outcome.

In the Beginning
As creating miracles relies on similar game mechanics as spells, gamemasters and players should reach the “Magic” chapter before delving
into this chapter. The terminology then won’t seem so unfamiliar.

Invocations versus Spells
Invoking miracles diﬀers from casting spells in a fundamental
way. Magic bends the forces of the universe according to alternate
laws of nature. Miracles require a connection to a divine will or higher
power. The beneﬁt of this is that invocations can be more eﬀective
— they receive a larger result points bonus, have a lower minimum
diﬃculty, don’t need a targeting roll, and don’t require the cleric to
see her target. The downside is that the religious devotee has less
freedom than his wizarding counterpart — the religion dictates the
aspects the cleric may use and circumstances in which the cleric
may call for aid.

The Basis of Miracles

A mythos, also known as a religion, encompasses the stories,
symbols, practices, beliefs, and history that people use to connect
themselves to the spiritual power of their universe. A mythos is a
peoples’ interpretation of the way spiritual power works; their faith
in this mythos can act as a conduit for such power. However, faith
can only carry power for purposes that coincide with the mythos,
and the power must manifest itself in ways that are consistent with
the beliefs. To have faith and work miracles in a religion is to accept
all of the core beliefs of the religion. If a religion says there is only
one true god, a faithful follower of that religion can only perform
miracles as long as she believes there is only one true god.
Religions diﬀer dramatically in their interpretation of nature, of
humanity’s place in nature, and the ethical structure of the universe.
Some religions set humanity (or one particular sentient race) apart
from nature, usually one notch above the rest of the world. A character
believing himself to be separate from nature may use nature as he sees

ﬁt; for example, animals may be killed for any reason that beneﬁts
Mankind, as Mankind is a more divine creature than any other.
Many religions having a strong link with nature assign humanity
a place as a piece of nature. In some nature-centered mythos, prayers
must be spoken to get a deer’s permission to kill it, for a deer is as
close to the spirits of the world as humanity is.
Before allowing a player to have a character who performs miracles,
the gamemaster (possibly with input from the player) must ﬁrst
develop the religion or religions of his setting. That means deciding
on the central higher power or powers, which one the character is
devoted to, and several tenets or requirements of the religion, including any that are speciﬁc to the character’s preferred higher power.
The Religion Worksheet on the next page can help. (Fill out the sheet
once for the overall religion and once for any speciﬁc gods or powers
whose tenets vary from the core.) Knowing a few of the basic tenets
can help the gamemaster decide what sorts of actions the cleric needs
to perform in order to invoke a miracle (see “Required Aspects” under
“Creating Miracles” for some suggestions).
Religions that have multiple gods may have general requirements
for the religion and speciﬁc requirements for each god. Some of the
gods might be jealous and demand complete devotion to them, while
others could be more lenient and allow their followers to call upon
the aid of other (preferably lesser) gods.
Some religions, even monotheistic ones, have not-quite-omnipotent beings aiding or hampering their followers. Called spirits, ances-

Basic Types of Religions
Animism: Belief that all things have a vital life force.
Some versions of animism state that all things have a soul
or spirit.
Monotheism: Belief that there is only one god.
Pantheism: Belief that divine beings and the world are
the same thing; the creator is the universe.
Panentheism: Belief that all reality is part of the body of a
divine being or beings; the universe is a part of the creator.
Polytheism: Belief that there are many gods, though no
one god might be vastly greater in power than the others.
Atheism: Belief in the nonexistence of divine beings
or spiritual power that can aﬀect the everyday existence
of humanity. Atheists cannot work any miracles, and so
cannot have the Miracles attribute. However, they can have
the atheism specialization of mettle, to reﬂect their extreme
support of this philosophy. Atheists are treated as strong
disbelievers by all mythos.

Chapter 14
tors, celestials, angels, saints, demons, and a host of other terms,
these beings are not usually worshipped by themselves but can be
called upon to act as intermediaries with the divine presence. They
might have a few additional invocation aspect requirements (generally
special prayers or other incantations) necessary to add their help to
that of the higher power.
Note that calling upon the aid of a being whose purposes conﬂict
with the character’s core religion can have detrimental eﬀects — from
an increased diﬃculty in performing miracles consistent with the
primary religion to losing Fate Points. (The gamemaster decides on
the most appropriate penalties.)

Obtaining Access to Miracles
All characters who want to have the Miracles Extranormal attribute
must have at least one rank each in the Devotion and Employed
Disadvantages, both related to their religion. Neither of these count
toward the character’s maximum number of Disadvantages.
After that, there are only two ways for players’ characters to get
miraculous abilities. The ﬁrst is to put dice in the Miracles attribute
and skills at character creation, which costs the same as obtaining
other attributes.

• Page 104
The second is to obtain the gamemaster’s permission after play
has begun. If the player can come up with a reason for the character
to learn or gain magic abilities (such as they were latent or were a
gift from a supernatural being) and the gamemaster agrees, then
the player may purchase them for the character. The cost to get the
initial 1D in Miracles is 20 Character Points. After that, it is 10 times
the number in front of the “D” to improve this attribute by one pip.
The player must still purchase Miracles skill pips separately, though
a player may buy one pip in one Miracles skill for the character at the
same time as he initially gets the attribute after character creation.
When player gives her character the Miracles attribute, she must
declare what speciﬁc religion she is faithful to. A character may never
have multiple versions of the Miracles attribute, nor may she have
any skill, Advantage, or Disadvantage that aﬀects her because of her
faith in another religion.
Gamemasters are discouraged from allowing characters to have
multiple Extranormal abilities, but it is possible, especially if the
character has several Disadvantages that show up frequently in each
session. However, some religions may allow — even require — their
clerics to have experience with both magical and divine abilities.

Miracles

Untrained Invocations
Characters might have moments of inspiration in areas in
which they have no training. For those who have some training (that is, pips or dice in any Miracles skill), the diﬃculty
increases by +5 to invoke a miracle using a skill in which they
have no experience. For those who have no training (that is,
no pips or dice in any Miracles skill but they do have dice in
the Miracles attribute), the diﬃculty increases by +10 for all
invocations.

Learning & Improving
Miracles Skills
Miracles skills may be learned between adventures, like regular
skills. The cost for a Miracles skill, in Character Points, equals twice
the normal cost for gaining or improving a normal skill. This cost is
doubled again if a teacher — simply another cleric with the skill at a
higher level — is not available to instruct the character. A character
may learn or improve one Miracles skill after each adventure.

Miracles Skills
All invocations require one of these skills in order to cast them.
When invoking a special prayer, the character generates a Miracles
skill total and tries to beat the invocation’s diﬃculty. If the skill
total equals or exceeds the diﬃculty, then the invocation works (to
a greater or lesser extent).

Divination
Divination involves obtaining knowledge of one’s surroundings
and of the past and future. Miracles that increase or decrease the
Intellect or Acumen attributes or the skills that fall under them require
the divination skill to work properly.

Favor
Miracles that relate to building up, enhancing, or creating something fall under the favor skill. Some examples include increasing
attributes, adding skills, bestowing Special Abilities, and conjuring
food — as long as giving any of these in no way harms the target or
can be used by the target for harm. Thus, a devotee would use this
skill to improve another character’s dodge but not to improve his
marksmanship ability. Likewise, the favor skill could not work with a
miracle that gives a character a Disadvantage (which falls under the
strife skill), nor does it aﬀect Intellect or Acumen attributes or skills
(those are the domain of the divination skill).

Strife
Characters use the strife skill with miracles that deal with destruction, reduction, or harm. Some examples include slowing another’s
movement, decreasing skills or attributes, increasing or gifting
combat skills (except dodge), causing injury, interrupting another
miracle or spell, and cursing targets with Disadvantages. It cannot

• Page 105

be used to aﬀect Intellect or Acumen attributes or skills, as these fall
under the divination skill.

Using Invocations &
Their Effects
Roll the skill for the invocation in question to get a skill total.
If the total is higher than the diﬃculty number, the invocation has
succeeded and the devotee may use the miracle eﬀect.
Which Miracles skill the invocation requires is either decided when
the eﬀect is developed or listed with a sample miracle.
Remember that players may spend Character and Fate Points to make
sure they have suﬃciently high skill totals to invoke the miracle.
With a higher power there to help a miracle to happen, most
invocations do not require a targeting roll. (This is quite unlike a
magical spell.) Furthermore, the devotee need not even see her target
for her prayer to aﬀect it. Gamemasters may allow the requirement
of a targeting roll or the target being within the cleric’s line of sight
to be optional conditions of the invocation.
For those miracle that do have targeting rolls, invoking them at
the same time as using its targeting skill is not considered a multiaction. However, if the character wishes to call for a miracle with
targeting skill roll in addition to using a sword in the same round,

Invocation Success Levels
These guidelines can help you determine how well a miracle
occurred. Subtract the diﬃculty from the Miracles skill total
to get the result points, then use that number to determine
the level. Where appropriate, the invocation receives a miracle
success bonus equal to the diﬀerence between the skill and
the diﬃculty. This bonus may apply to to the eﬀect or one
aspect of the miracle.
Minimal (0–2): The miracle meets the needs of the
devotee while disturbing the environment as little as possible. It would be hard to convince anyone that it wasn’t
simply coincidence.
Good (3–6): The miracle not only happens as desired, there
is some small side eﬀect that divine intervention happened.
The eﬀect depends on the type of miracle and the nature of
the divinity called upon, but it could include bright colors in
the area, sweeter air, an uglier wound, and so on.
Superior (7–12): The miracle occurs much better than
hoped, and the devotee gains some additional beneﬁt, such
as asking for navigational aid on a cloudy day and not only
getting a breeze to disperse the clouds, but also ﬁnding a
map to guide them.
Spectacular (13 or more): There is no question that
divine intervention caused the miracle to occur. The results
are well beyond what the devotee requested, though not
more than the situation needs. For instance, if the character wished merely to harm someone and not to kill them, a
miracle causing injury would not bring death to the target
if the devotee managed this level of success.

Chapter 14

• Page 106
kind of miracle, such as to save a friend’s life, the miracle would also
get a -5 modiﬁer.

Choosing the Skill
What happens when a cleric wants to include eﬀects dealt
with by more than one Miracle skill? The gamemaster and
player need to decide what the intent of the invocation is. For
instance, a miracle that creates an undead helper endowed
with the ability to lift objects and look for small items falls
under favor, while one that resurrects someone in order to
wreak havoc — even if that means giving the undead the lifting skill to carry oﬀ objects or people or the tracking or search
skill to look for them — comes under strife.

then the multi-action modiﬁer of -1D (for taking two actions in the
same round) is applied to the miracle skill roll, the miracle targeting
roll, and the weapon targeting roll.

Strain and Failure Options
If an invocation fails with a Critical Failure, the devotee may not
attempt that miracle for at least 24 hours (depending on how much
she failed the roll by) or until she undergoes a puriﬁcation ritual or
performs some other restriction dictated by her religion.
To simulate the strain of channeling the divine will, gamemasters
may choose to increase the diﬃculty to invoke miracles by 1 for each
invocation that the character performs beyond a set number (such
as ﬁve or 10) before the cleric has a chance to rest (generally, ﬁve
minutes or so per miracle cast prior to the break).

Circumstances of Invocations
Invocations are spiritual power realized to fulﬁll a need of the faithful, often aﬀecting the material world. Invocations are not spells, dry
processes that may be learned and then safely put away in a magic jar
for use when desired. The conditions facing the faithful who request
the miracle greatly aﬀect the outcome of the miracle.
Every mythos has certain certain basic tenets. A miracle that does
not conform to those tenets suﬀers a modiﬁer to its diﬃculty. Gamemasters can also penalize miracles if the devotee has no immediate
need for them. Similarly, clerics casting miracles to save their own
lives or the lives of the faithful receive a bonus. See the accompanying
chart for details; all modiﬁers listed are cumulative.
Example: A cleric who belongs to a religion with ﬁrm restrictions
against killing for any reason decides to invoke a lethal miracle. This
adds 15 to the diﬃculty. If the cleric also had urgent need of that

Miracles that beneﬁt no one cannot be performed. Thus, a cleric
belonging to a religion restricting killing can cause only harm to
another living being if doing so would save another person (and
possibly herself) from injury.

Designing Invocations
The game mechanics of creating invocations work the same way
(in general) as designing spells, though the game-world process is
diﬀerent. Read through these restrictions and modiﬁcations to spell
aspects, then use the guidelines in the “Magic” chapter to create
your miracles.

Starting the Process
Begin the invocation design process in the same manner as the
spell design process, with the starting Spell Total and Negative Spell
Total Modiﬁers (see page 86). Then, continue the process in the same
manner as for a spell, keeping the restrictions and requirements for
miracles in mind.
Most invocation Spell Totals begin at zero, but gamemasters who
want requested divine intervention less common and miracles to be
more diﬃcult to invoke should have a greater starting Spell Total. The
Negative Spell Total Modiﬁer always starts at zero.
The blank Invocation Design Sheet, found at the end of this chapter, includes a worksheet that can help you with the calculations. A
calculator might also help.

Required Aspects
Miracles share the same basic aspects as spells — eﬀect, range,
speed, duration, and casting time. However, they also involve one
or more limiting factors, as dictated by the religion. The cleric does
gain the beneﬁt from adding it to the miracle. Clerics must include
the required aspects in any miracle they perform, though, unless the
religion mandates otherwise, they don’t need to include all of them.
Required aspects include: community, components, concentration,
countenance, feedback, gestures, and incantation.

Disallowed Aspects
A miracle may not include charges (except as a ward) or unreal
eﬀects. Generally, gamemasters should disallow the other alterants
aspect; the success of the miracle dictates its eﬀects. It’s unwise for
a devotee to ask for more than the minimum that would satisfy her
current need.

Although miracles can involve most Magic spell aspects as is, a
handful have restrictions or modiﬁcations.

Casting Time
The minimum casting time required by all miracles is 1.5 seconds
(which has a value of 1). Should the mythos also require any other
aspect outside of a single-word or single-sound incantation, quick
gesture, or the like, the casting time may need to be readjusted to

Miracles
take this into account. Subtract this from the miracle’s diﬃculty.
See the “Adjusting Sample Miracles” part in the “Sample Miracles”
section for further details on changing the casting time.

• Page 107

Charges
The only way a miracle can be charged is to install it as a ward in
something. No skill may circumvent a miraculous ward; therefore,
that part of the modiﬁer may not be included.

Community
A cleric may only gain beneﬁt from those who believe in the same
or related mythos.
To determine how eﬀective a community is with a pre-existing
invocation, ﬁgure the community modiﬁer for the group the cleric
intends to use. (The focus of the miracle, as long as it’s not the miracle
invoker, can be considered part of the community.) Subtract the new
community modiﬁer from the one required by the miracle (if any).
Divide this number by 2 and round up. Subtract this number from
the miracle’s diﬃculty.
Gamemasters may optionally allow the faithfulness of helpers
to aﬀect the miracle. A designer of a ritual may include this factor
in the miracle’s design, or it can be tacked on when someone performs the miracle. Use the accompanying chart to determine the
helpers’ faithfulness. The level of faithfulness refers only to helpers
who believe in the same mythos as the cleric, or who are strongly
opposed to it. Those who believe in other mythos that share some
of the basic tenets of the cleric’s mythos might, at the gamemaster’s
discretion, provide a modiﬁer of 1 or 2 (depending on how closely
the two mythos are). Add the modiﬁer to the Negative Spell Total
Modiﬁers at miracle design or subtract one-half (rounded up) from
the sample miracle’s diﬃculty.

Components, Gestures, Incantations
The most common components include the following: food;
plants; enemies; tattoos; locations (such as standing on holy ground
or near a sacred tree); alignment of planets; phase of the moon; and
items of value (either as deﬁned by the society or personally to the
cleric). The rarity of the item, location, or situation determines the
modiﬁer that the aspect provides.
The most common gestures include the following: folding hands
or arms; touching, waving, or making motions with a holy symbol;

holding the hands in a certain way; totem carving; dancing; painting;
drawing designs on skin; violent acts; playing a musical instrument;
ringing bells or similar items; complex body positions; sensory deprivation; bathing; speciﬁc body movements; and gathering items. Any
of these may be used at any complexity.
The most common incantations include the following: words or
thoughts directed or related to the divinity in praise, thanksgiving,
pardon, or petition; one or more of the divinity’s names; passages
from religious texts; words or phrases sacred to the divinity; and oaths
of fealty to the divinity. They could be sung, spoken, or chanted. Any
of these may be used at any complexity.

Countenance
Generally, a devotee will go pale, have ﬂushed cheeks, or shake
convulsively. No psychic illusion ever touches their features.

Feedback
Feedback represents self-sacriﬁce by the devotee. It also may
include some sort of physical gesture. Generally, the devotee cannot
simply will himself to become injured; he must actually do something
harmful to himself. (As this is a gesture, he also gets the modiﬁer
from that aspect.)
However, the gamemaster may permit the possibility that the
divine power to which the cleric is devoted can injure him. In this
circumstance, the character only receives the modiﬁer from feedback;
any self-immolation modiﬁer would be included separately.

Chapter 14

Variable Movement
As invocations generally do not require a targeting roll, nor does the
devotee need to see the target, most of this aspect serves no purpose
for a miracle. Nonetheless, the cleric might ﬁnd that “movement of
eﬀect” comes in handy on occasion.

Other Conditions
Gamemasters should carefully consider whether the mythos supports the player’s proposed modifying condition before allowing a
player to include it in her miracle design.
Physical touch exists as the most common other condition modiﬁer. It provides a modiﬁer of -1 to -3, depending on how diﬃcult it
is to make contact.

Minimum Difficulty
The minimum diﬃculty for any invocation is 5.

Design Time
Miracles that have no aspects providing modiﬁers greater than 2
have a design time of one round, regardless of the miracle diﬃculty.
For all others, follow the Magic design time guidelines.

Sample Invocations
Adjusting Sample Invocations
These sample invocations have been designed as generically as
possible. Thus, they do not include any of the required aspects as
modiﬁers. To add the mythos’ speciﬁc requirements, determine the
value of all of the modifying aspects needed. Then divide this by 2 and
round up. Subtract that number from the diﬃculty to determine the
new diﬃculty of the miracle. Should the required modiﬁers drop the
miracle’s diﬃculty below 5 (not including any circumstances modiﬁers), the player will need to recreate the miracle following the Magic
spell creation rules, though the minimum diﬃculty is 5.
For precalculated invocations that the cleric wishes to adapt to
his religion, it is best to recreate the miracle using the proper values
for the various aspects.

Example
A character belongs to a monotheistic religion that requires
invocations to include a prayer of at least a sentence or string of
holy words (incantation of -1 or more), bowing the head and crossing the arms on the chest (a simple gesture of -1 and a fairly simple
gesture of -2), or both. She decides to perform a foresight invocation
and include both a complex incantation with a persuasion diﬃculty
of 11 and her gestures. This gives her a total requirement modiﬁer
of 3 (3 for the incantation + 3 for the gesture = 6, divided by 2 = 3).
She subtracts this number from the foresight diﬃculty of 19 to get
a modiﬁed divination diﬃculty of 16.

A bless person surrounds and infuses the target character with
spiritual energy, as long as the target remains within 10 meters of
the blessing cleric. The blessing enhances one attribute of the cleric’s
choosing, which must be selected at the time he performs the blessing. The blessed character receives the miracle success bonus to all
related totals.
A character may enjoy the eﬀects of only one bless at any given
time. The cleric may use bless person on himself.

Enhance Food
Skill Used: Favor
Diﬃculty: 8
Eﬀect: 1 (1.5 kilograms of food)
Range: 1 meter or less (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 4 hours (+21)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): Any kind of food, in any condition (very
common)
Food blessed by this miracle becomes better tasting, more nutritious, and possibly transforms into another food entirely. If not eaten
within 10 minutes of its improvement, the food turns back to its
original condition. (The four-hour duration is about how long it takes
for the body to break down the food, so the food needs to remain in
existence within the body for at least that long.)
Minimal or average success turns spoiled meat, rotted vegetables,
and the like into fresh food again. Good success can cleanse any food
of any impurities or poisons. Superior success increases the quality
of the food to the very best possible. Spectacular success actually
transforms the food into a diﬀerent kind of food; changing from

Miracles
a common fruit to an exotic one, from a cheap cut of pork to an
expensive cut of beef, water to wine, and so on.

Healing
Skill Used: Favor
Diﬃculty: 7
Eﬀect: 17 (healing skill of 5D+2)
Range: 1 meter or less or touch (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1.5 seconds (+1)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
None required
By channeling her spiritual energy to an injured person or creature,
the devotee can use this miracle to heal harm as if she had 5D+2 in
the healing skill. Add the miracle success bonus to the healing total.

Multiply Food
Skill Used: Favor
Diﬃculty: 8
Eﬀect: 1 (1.5 kilograms of food)
Range: 1 meter or less (0)

• Page 109

Speed: 0
Duration: 4 hours (+21)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Components (-2): About a kilogram of any kind of edible food
(very common)
The multiplying food invocation is performed on an amount of
existing food equal to a decent meal for one normal person. For
each success level gained, double the amount of food. Any food not
eaten within 10 minutes of its production rots or turns to dust. (As
with enhance food, the food needs to be within the body for at least
four hours to give the body enough time to break it down and get
nourishment from it.)

Ritual of Purification
Skill Used: Favor
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 20 (compare to miracle or curse diﬃculty)
Range: 2.5 meters (+2)
Speed: +2
Duration: 30 minutes (+16)
Casting Time: 30 minutes (-16)
Other Aspects:
None required
The puriﬁcation ceremony heightens awareness
of one’s religion and removes the impurities of the
mundane and the material from the spirit. With a
minimal or average success, it allows the target to
invoke one miracle he failed or it removes one curse
(either magical or miraculous). For any level above
average, the target either receives the miracle success
bonus to any miracle he attempts within the duration
of the ritual or may add the miracle success bonus
to the eﬀect’s value to allow invocation of one failed
miracle or remove any one curse. The diﬃculty of the
curse or failed miracle must be equal to or less than
the eﬀect’s value (plus the miracle success bonus, if
applicable) in order for the ritual to work.

Spiritual Shield
Skill Used: Favor
Diﬃculty: 13
Eﬀect: 16 (Armor Value of 5D+1)
Range: 1.5 meters (+1)
Speed: +1
Duration: 5 rounds (+7)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Area eﬀect (+2): 1-meter radius
If successfully invoked, a shield of spiritual energy,
about two meters in diameter, appears up to 1.5
meters in front of the cleric. It oﬀers an Armor Value
of 5D+1 against all types of physical (not mental)
attacks.

Chapter 14

Divination
Detect the Living
Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 20
Eﬀect: 24 (search of 8D to locate a single type of creature)
Range: Self (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 10 seconds (+5)
Casting Time: 1 minute (-9)
Other Aspects:
Area eﬀect (+20): 10-meter radius circle
Other Condition (-1): Limited to one type of creature
Before invoking, the devotee decides what sort of being he seeks.
Should the cleric successfully invoke the miracle, he can detect the
presence of any such being within a 10-meter radius for two rounds,
whether he can see it or not. The higher the search skill total is above
the diﬃculty, the more information the caster knows about the beings
he seeks (such as location, number, gender, etc.). The diﬃculty starts
at 10 for a Human-sized creature, and goes down for larger creatures,
up for smaller ones, and up for the number of other types of creatures
in the area. Add the miracle success bonus to the search total.

Foresight
Skill Used: Divination
Diﬃculty: 19
Eﬀect: 34 (2.5 months)
Range: Self (0)
Speed: 0
Duration: 1 minute (+9)

• Page 110
Casting Time: 2 rounds (-5)
Other Aspects:
None required
When the cleric invokes this miracle, he chooses to look for a condition that could occur up to two and a half months into the future.
He can see one minute’s worth of the future. Use the success level
to determine the information received: Minimal reveals confusing
images. Average allows one useful fact to be gleaned from the vision.
Good provides the cleric with a few useful facts, including the time
of the occurrence. Superior allows the cleric to note more details,
including time and location. Spectacular lets the cleric see the scene
as if he were present, though in shades of gray.

Strife
Banish
Skill Used: Strife
Diﬃculty: 15
Eﬀect: 12 (compare to 2 times the target’s Charisma or mettle)
Range: 20 meters (+7)
Speed: +7
Duration: 1 minute (+9)
Casting Time: 1 rounds (-4)
Other Aspects:
Other Condition (-1): Limited to humanoids (including undead)
devoted to a diﬀerent religion/god/power or undead controlled by
a character devoted to a diﬀerent religion/god/power
The miracle can only be used against opponents of a diﬀerent
religion. If successfully invoked, compare the eﬀect total to a value
equal to 2 times the target’s Charisma or mettle (including any spe-

Miracles
cialization related to religion). If the target has not taken an action
yet this round, she may actively defend by generating a mettle total
(including her faith specialization), but this is considered her action
for the round. For undead without a mettle or Charisma score, use
the die code of the creatures’ controller.
If the target has a lower total, she ﬂees the area (if possible).

Bless Weapon
Skill Used: Strife
Diﬃculty: 13
Eﬀect: 9 (+2D damage bonus)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: +5
Duration: 8 rounds (+8)
Casting Time: 2 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
None required
Bless weapon infuses spiritual energy into any one weapon, as
long as the item remains within 10 meters of the blessing cleric.
The invocation applies the miracle success bonus to the damage of
the blessed item.
A character may enjoy the eﬀects of only one bless at any given
time. The cleric may use bless weapon on an item he’s holding.

Curse
Skill Used: Strife
Diﬃculty: 14
Eﬀect: 6 (Bad Luck (R2) Disadvantage)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: +5
Duration: 10 minutes (+14)
Casting Time: 1 round (-4)
Other Aspects:
Focused (+4): On target
Other Condition (-2): Limited to humanoids
The cleric curses a single humanoid target with 10 minutes of
Bad Luck (R2), which doesn’t leave the target even if he moves out
of range. See the description of this Disadvantage in the “Character
Options” chapter for details. Each success level doubles the amount
of time that the target has the curse.

Disrupt Spell
Skill Used: Strife
Diﬃculty: 25
Eﬀect: 29 (compare to skill total of spell countering)
Range: 60 meters (+9)
Speed: +9
Duration: 1 round (+4)
Casting Time: 2 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
None required
The cleric concentrates on the spell he wishes to counter. The eﬀect’s
value plus the miracle’s miracle success bonus are compared to the
skill total used to create the targeted spell. If the disrupt spell number
equals or exceeds the target spell’s skill total, the spell is broken.

Fighting Tree
Skill Used: Strife
Diﬃculty: 23
Eﬀect: 24 (4D in ﬁghting and 4D in damage)
Range: 5 meters (+4)
Speed: +4
Duration: 1 hours (+18)
Casting Time: 2 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Components (-3): A long supple tree or one with long branches
(common)
Through this prayer, the cleric can animate the branches of a
tree to strike at anyone within range. Branches that hit the target
inﬂict 4D of damage. The tree can strike at no more than Short range
— less if it’s small.

Spiritual Bolt
Skill Used: Strife
Diﬃculty: 12
Eﬀect: 12 (4D in damage)
Range: 10 meters (+5)
Speed: +5
Duration: 3.5 seconds (+3)
Casting Time: 1.5 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
None required
The cleric gathers spiritual energy to throw in a bolt at a target.
It does 4D in damage at a range of up to 10 meters. She must make
a marksmanship roll to hit the target. The bolt must be ﬁred in the
same round that the cleric invokes the invocation.

Undead Warrior
Skill Used: Strife
Diﬃculty: 27
Eﬀect: 27 (4D in ﬁghting and lifting; 1D in running)
Range: 25 meters (+7)
Speed: +7
Duration: 1.5 hours (+19)
Casting Time: 2 seconds (-1)
Other Aspects:
Components (-5): Intact dead body or skeleton (very rare)
This rite causes any one dead creature to rise in its present state
to serve as a soldier bonded to the cleric. As this is a basic miracle, it
imbues the creature with select skills; the cleric may add more and
increase the diﬃculty. The reanimated being cannot think for itself, so
it ignores all Wound level and hit location penalties. It does whatever
the cleric demands, until the invoker tells it to stop or the duration
ends. At the end of the duration or if the cleric sends it out of range,
the creature falls down in a heap. The invocation’s miracle success
bonus may either add to the range or to the amount of damage the
creature does (it has a base Strength Damage of 2D); which application must be decided before invoking the miracle.

CHAPTER XV

• Equipment •
What’s in this Chapter
This chapter gives game mechanics for popular equipment, including gear, armor, and weapons, plus how to purchase them. Game
eﬀects for various weapon types are also included. Gamemasters need
to decide what’s suitable for their particular settings. All equipment
described herein is of the basic, nonmagical variety.

Purchasing Equipment
Each piece of equipment has a price diﬃculty associated with it
that expresses how challenging it is for a character to obtain that item.
If using Funds as an attribute, to purchase an item, the player rolls
the attribute against the listed purchase diﬃculty, adjusted by the
gamemaster for the circumstances around obtaining the item (such
as seller’s stock, item quality, general item availability, and so on).
If the Funds total equals or exceeds the price diﬃculty, the character
gets the item. Trading, bluﬀ, charm, and persuasion could all serve as
complementary actions to the Funds roll, depending on the factors
the gamemaster chooses to include (such as local law, relationship
of buyer and seller, and so on).
Prices listed in this chapter do not reﬂect any modiﬁers the gamemaster may wish to include.
Any item with a price diﬃculty equal to or less than the number in
front of the “D” in the character’s Funds attribute is an automatic purchase. A character may make several automatic purchases per day.
Any item with a price diﬃculty greater than the number in front
of the “D” in the character’s Funds attribute but less than or equal
to 3 times that number is an average purchase. A character may
make one average purchase per day.
Any item with a price diﬃculty greater than 3 times the number
in front of the “D” in the character’s Funds attribute is a luxury
purchase. A character may make one luxury purchase every seven
days.
When deciding on the type of purchase, include in the diﬃculty
breakdowns any modiﬁers due to an Advantage or Disadvantage.
Example: A character has 3D+2 in her Funds attribute. Her automatic purchases have a diﬃculty of 3 or less. Her average purchases
have a diﬃculty of 4 to 9. Her luxury purchases have a diﬃculty of
10 or more. If the character also had Wealth (R1), she would add her
bonus of +2 to each of these levels, giving her automatic purchases at
5 or less, average purchases between 6 and 11, and luxury purchases
at 12 or more.
Failure on a Funds roll means that the character didn’t have the
money for some reason (forgetting to bring enough coins, etc.). Except
when the total is abysmal, the character may roll again after a short
period of time and attempting to ﬁx the problem.

Unless the gamemaster decides otherwise, players may not spend
Character and Fate Points on Funds rolls.

Coins
Some gamemasters prefer coins to rolling dice for purchasing goods.
They may make their own system to use in their settings, or take this
one: eight copper pieces equals one silver piece; eight silver pieces equals

Price Difficulties
Cost of Item or Service
Cheap (a few copper coins)
Inexpensive (a few silver coins)
Nominally expensive (several gold coins)
Somewhat expensive (a few handfuls of
gold coins)

Very Expensive (hundreds of gold coins)
Costly* (thousands of gold coins)

Diﬃculty
Level
Very Easy (VE)
Easy (E)
Moderate (M)
Diﬃcult (D)

*“Costly” is hardly the top end, and gamemasters should con-tinue
adding to the diﬃculty for higher prices.

one gold piece. Though this might not seem like an elegant system, it’s
more akin to how the coins would have been minted and split: A round
coin can easily be sliced into eight relatively equal parts.
Gamemasters may then select reasonable monetary values based on
the diﬃculty level given; the lists include sample numbers followed by
C for copper, S for silver, and G for gold. Or gamemasters can roll 3D
and multiplying the total by an appropriate amount for each level. For
example, to convert to the suggested monetary system, use: one copper
coin for Very Easy, one silver coin for Easy, one gold for Moderate, 10
gold coins for Diﬃcult, 100 gold coins for Very Diﬃcult, 1,000 gold
coins for Heroic, and 10,000 gold coins for Legendary.

Mystical Artifacts
Forged by an ancient race, created by supernatural beings, or
discarded from another dimension, mystical artifacts take many
forms. Some are completely beneﬁcial, while others have a secret
or obvious curse.

Limitation: Burn-out (R1), can be lost or stolen). Price H (200 G).
Enchanted Dagger: The weapon gives the user a greater chance
of harming magical creatures (Natural Hand-to-Hand Weapon: Dagger (R1), +1D damage, with Magically Empowered (R2) and Burn-out

score; Skill Bonus: Magic Skills (R1), +1 to alteration, apportation, and
conjuration totals; both with Burn-out (R1), can be lost or stolen).
Price L (1,200 G).

Holy Items
Holy items are handheld objects representing a person’s faith. Some
are material worked into a symbol of the faith, such as crosses, stars,
ﬁgures, and writing characters. Others show the signiﬁcance of the
material itself, such as water or an herb, or an action, such as prayer
beads. The higher the level of the spiritual leader (such as a priest, rabbi,
or other cleric), the greater the beneﬁt the symbol imparts. Additionally,
the faith of the user and the target can inﬂuence the eﬀect.
Warding Holy Symbol: Shaped from metal or wood in a sacred
representation, this item helps the user turn away undead creatures
(Skill Bonus: Intimidation (R1), +3 to intimidation totals, with Ability
Loss (R1), only works on undead beings; Burn-out (R1), can be lost
or stolen). Price VD (20 G).
Blessed Water or Herbs: Sprinkled on the opponent, this causes
harm only to those with evil in their hearts (Natural Magick (R10):
Harm to Evil, eﬀect: 5D magical physical damage, range: 10 meters,
duration: 2.5 seconds, cast time: 1.5 seconds, Component: blessed
water or herbs, Other Condition: Against Evil Only, with Burn-out

Armor & Shields
Combining Armor
A character cannot wear two suits of the same type, though he
could combine some types. The listing below tells what armor may
be worn with what other armor and the kind of bonus it can provide.
Of course, layering armor assumes that the two pieces ﬁt together
— a character couldn’t wear two helmets, even if they were made of
diﬀerent materials. For protective gear not listed here, use the type
in this chart that the armor in question most closely resembles to
determine what it can be combined with.
Except armor providing less than a full die of protection, any
allowed combination oﬀers the character the complete armor bonus
for both layers, up to any maximums dictated by the game.
Hides and Fur, Bone and Hide: May be worn over any other
type of armor. May not be worn under anything. Adds a maximum
of +1 to the Armor Value of the total combination.
Soft Leather, Heavy Fabric, Quilted Silk: May be worn over or
under any other type of armor. Adds a maximum of +1 to the Armor
Value of the total combination.

Shields: May be combined with any armor, but only oﬀer protection if held between the attacker and the user. May not be combined
with other shields unless stacked in a stationary position.

Encumbrance Option
Wearing a lot of protective gear can make performing certain
actions challenging. Each additional layer of armor increases Agilitybased diﬃculties by +4 or more, depending on the joint ﬂexibility of the
pieces. The gamemaster might also apply this modiﬁer to any armor,
especially heavy or bulky ones like plate and bone and hide, including
an additional modiﬁer of +1 for every full die in Armor Value.

Minimal Armor Option
Many adventurers like to show oﬀ their well-endowed (muscled
or otherwise) or heavily tattooed bodies. Against humanoids with an
Intellect of less than 4D, the character wearing fanciful armor receives
a +1D bonus to all charm or intimidation rolls for the ﬁrst round of
each scene (as appropriate for the character’s physical presence).
However, humanoids with Intellects of 4D or more see through the
ruse, and the character receives no bonus.
Furthermore, the gamemaster should ignore the Armor Value
when determining the eﬀects of called shots to unarmored portions
of the body.

Some characters carry around their own protection, so it doesn’t
make much sense to add more to it. The maximum damage resistance
roll a character can have before adding any negative modiﬁers, Character Points, or Fate Points but including Physique, protective gear and
abilities, and other modiﬁers is 6D. Ignore any Armor Value above
this. Gamemasters may adjust this depending on how eﬀective they
want protective gear to be.

Weapons
All weapons described in this section were designed with Humans
in mind. Characters more than twice or less than half the size of
Humans do not receive their scale modiﬁer when attempting to employ
Human-sized weapons. Additionally, for missile weapons, very large
and very small humanoids may incur at least a +5 modiﬁer to the
combat diﬃculty or even ﬁnd it impossible to use the tiny objects.
For simplicity, gamemasters may have the weapons of larger or
smaller humanoids deal the same amount of damage as their Humansized counterparts, making certain to include the scale modiﬁer to
account for increased or decreased damage. Human-sized characters
relying on weapons designed for someone larger or smaller than
themselves use the scale modiﬁer of the creature for which the item
is designed — they do not use their own scale modiﬁer when attacking. (They do use their own scale modiﬁer when they defend.)
For more information on using scale, see page 71.

Terminology
Damage: Damage is the amount of harm a weapon does. Melee,
thrown, and those missile weapons relying on a person’s strength to
determine their power are enhanced by the characters’ Strength Damage (see “Determining Strength Damage” on page 62 on determine the
die code). Weapons that are aﬀected by strength have a “+” in front
of their damage die code. Note that the damage is based on the rate
of ﬁre; most weapons have a rate of ﬁre of once per round. See the
“Combat Options” chapter for guidelines on other rates of ﬁre.
Range: This factor takes into account that the weapon is less
eﬀective the farther it is from the target. The values given are the
maximums, in meters, for Short, Medium, and Long ranges.
For generated values, roll the character’s Physique or lifting. The
modiﬁer after “PHYS” indicates the number to take from or add onto the
total. These totals, in meters, determines the ranges the character can
throw the item. If the total becomes zero or less because of the modiﬁer,
then the character cannot throw the item to that range. (Gamemaster

Special Weapons
Certain supernatural beings have an Achilles’ Heel Disadvantage relating to some types of metal, particularly silver or
iron. Any sharp-edged weapon can be made of or coated in
these substances, and they do additional damage as described
by the creature’s Disadvantage or description.

Muscle-Powered
Weapons
who prefer straight values should multiply the die code in Physique or
lifting by 4, then add the pips to get the “PHYS” value.)

Muscle-powered weapons include all those that
depend upon a character’s strength to get them to
their target. Instead of having their damage die codes listed as a single
number, muscle-powered weapons have damage adds.

Gunpowder Weapons

Missile & Thrown Weapons

Not every fantasy setting includes the invention of gunpowder,
but for those that have, here are a few weapons using that propellant.
The guns rely on marksmanship for their accuracy, while the black
powder bomb needs throwing to loft it to a new location.
Note that both muskets are quite heavy, requiring a wooden rest
to allow proper aiming. Anyone not using a rest must take
a multi-action, using one action to lift the gun (Physique
or lifting diﬃculty of 3) and one to ﬁre the weapon.

All missile and thrown weapons take an action to reload, either to
notch another arrow or pull out another dart. Generally, characters
may reload in the same round as ﬁring or throwing (with a multiaction penalty), except crossbows, which require the character to
replace the bolt and crank it in place.

Arquebus: Also known as the matchlock musket,
the arquebus is a simple weapon with a wooden stock
and heavy iron barrel. It varies in length from 1.2 to 1.8
meters or more and weighs nine kilograms.
The weapon is a simple muzzle-loader; in other words,
the ﬁrer must load powder charge, wadding, and shot
down the barrel, then tamp it down using a ramrod. Once
the weapon is loaded, the ﬁrer ignites the powder with
a device called a matchlock. This holds a burning match
— often a slow-burning piece of thin cord — at the upper
end, and a lever or trigger at the lower end. By pulling the
lever or trigger, the ﬁrer swings the match smoothly on
to the touchhole, igniting the powder. Musket: damage
3D+2; range 10/20/40; price D (10 G). Charge, wadding,
and shot: VE (2 S) per bullet packet.
Wheellock Musket and Pistol: The wheellock
involves iron pyrites scraping against a wheel that turns
when the trigger is pulled, igniting a spark that sets
oﬀ the primer. The musket is about 1.2 to 1.8 meters
in length, and 10 kilograms in weight, while the pistol
is 15 centimeters and a little more than 3.5 kilograms
in weight.Wheellock pistols are commonly carried in a
brace of two, alongside the sword, and are of great use
against armored foes. Like the matchlock musket, the
wheellock musket requires a stand to aim correctly. The
pistol and the musket each require 12 rounds to reload

†
Allows user to attack at Point Blank or up to 2 meters away
at Short range; incurs unwieldy weapon modiﬁer of +5.

Whips
A whip is a long, plaited strip attached to a handle. When
a character uses it to strike a target, determine the success
with the melee combat skill.
A whip can also be used to entangle an opponent up to two
meters away. The character uses throwing to make this kind
of attack. If it’s successful, the whip wraps about the target.
If it’s unsuccessful, the target takes full damage.
It can also be used to disarm opponents (as a throwing
called shot) or to swing over pits or other openings. To swing
with the whip, the character makes a Diﬃcult throwing roll
to catch the whip around a projection overhead that can
support her weight. (The gamemaster may include modiﬁers
depending on the conditions.)

Improvised Weapons
When a character’s up against something ugly and angry, and
his favorite sword’s back at his hideout, he grabs whatever he can
to get the job done.
That means that gamemasters aren’t always going to ﬁnd established game mechanics for what their players want to use as weapons.
When this happens, the best way to handle the situation is use the
mechanics of something similar. Most items either serve as a dagger
(such as a broken bottle) or a club (such as a table leg). Then modify
the damage based on how sharp or heavy the improvised weapon is
to the comparison weapon.
Improvised weapons always use either melee combat or throwing,
and they always receive an improvised weapon modiﬁer to the combat
diﬃculty of +5 or more. On a card-played setback or a rolled Critical
Failure when wielding the item, most improvised weapons break, the
user hurts himself, or both — the greater the roll fails, the worse
the situation is. (If the user ends up hurting himself, use only the
weapon bonus — do not include the user’s Strength Damage — to
determine the amount of damage done.)
Generally, characters may rely on improvised weapons only a few
times before they break (regardless of whether a Critical Failure or a
setback occurred while using it), though ones designed to take abuse
— such a heavy length of metal or a blacksmith’s hammer — can
survive the battle (including Critical Failures) and continue to function as tools or armament.

Vehicles
This section introduces a few terms unique to means of
conveyance:
Scale Value: For gamemasters using the scale option (see page
71), this number indicates how much larger the vehicle is than a
Human, relative to a Human’s scale value of zero.
Move: This is approximately cruising speed, given in both meters
per round and (if applicable) kilometers per hour.
Passengers: The number of people, including the crew, that the
vehicle can carry. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the number of crew
needed to properly operate the vehicle is one.
Toughness: This is the vehicle’s base damage resistance die code.
It can also serve as a reasonable measure of the amount of damage it
can inﬂict. Players may not modify a vehicle’s Toughness by spending
Character or Fate Points on it.
Maneuverability: An indication of how easy the vehicle is to
handle. Stunts are easier to perform in vehicles with higher die
codes than in those with lower ones. The Maneuverability die code
is added to the driver’s or pilot’s appropriate skill total when that
person is attempting to do something fancy. (Vehicle stunts are
further explained in the “Movement” chapter.)

Melee Weapons

Ship Weapons

Most muscle-powered weapons are melee weapons. Swords, knives,
brass knuckles, and clubs are all examples. All of these weapons require
melee combat to use. Gamemasters may allow characters to employ

Occasionally, characters might ﬁnd it necessary to mount or have
mounted weapons on their sailing vessels.

Equipment
Cannon: Made of heavy metal, cannons use gunpowder (or a
magical substance) to project large metal balls at a target. Each small
cannon requires a crew of two to load and ﬁre, while a large cannon
needs a team of four. It requires one action each round to ﬁre either
size, and they can only be ﬁred every other round. The leader of the
cannon team aims and ﬁres the weapon, with the marksmanship skill.
A Critical Failure could mean that powder was added incorrectly and
it doesn’t ﬁre at all — or the gunpowder explodes in the cannon and
does damage to its users. Ships with a scale value of at least 15 may
add cannons. Cannons may not be turned, though their crews can
raise or lower them. Small cannon: damage 4D; range 50/200/800;
price diﬃculty of Very Diﬃcult per cannon or 75 gold. Large cannon:
damage 5D; range 50/150/500; price diﬃculty of Heroic per cannon
or 125 gold.

• Page 119

Catapult: A small rope-and-wood structure mounted on the
fore or aft of the ship, out of the way of the sails, the catapult slings
a large object (usually a rock or metal ball) at its target. It requires
a round to reload. Because of its diﬃculty to aim correctly, add +5
to the user’s marksmanship diﬃculty. They may be mounted on any
vessel with a scale value of at least 12. Catapult: damage 3D+2; range
45/90/180; price diﬃculty of Very Diﬃcult per catapult (up to two)
or 50 gold per catapult.
Ram: A long, stout wooden pole, the ram be mounted on any galley
or rowed ship with a scale value of at least 15. When the ship rams
another, the pilot must make a successful ramming roll using her pilotry.
With a successful attack, the defender receives double the normal damage, while the attacker gets half. These values are determined before
rolling against Toughness. A ram adds +5 to the roll to regain control of
the ship in the following round. Critical Failure on a low roll to regain
control indicate the ram has broken oﬀ and further damages the ship.
A ram adds +1 to the ship’s price diﬃculty or ﬁve gold.

Gamemasters might allow a smaller version of this weapon to be
mounted on large land vehicles.

• Gamemaster Tips •
What’s in this Chapter
You’ve made it this far, so you probably don’t want even more
“rules.” We’ll keep this chapter short by oﬀering a list of helpful ideas.
If you want more guidance, you can ﬁnd more gamemaster resources
online at www.westendgames.com.

The Tips
The most important rule to remember is have fun. All the other
rules in this book are intended to help you worry less about being
fair and more about enjoying developing a fantastic story with your
friends. Here are some ideas to help you with this.
• Before beginning play, skim the rulebook at least once. Refer to
it during the slow parts; make up the diﬃculties you can’t remember
during the exciting scenes.
• You’re in charge of the rules, not your players. However, ﬁnd that
balance between being too strict and too lenient. Players need to feel
both challenged and like they accomplish something. If the players
contend you made an error in judgment or presentation, rectify the
matter or make it up to them later.
• You are permitted to place restrictions on character creation if
you don’t think you can come up with obstacles challenging enough
for the players to run wild.
• Be descriptive. Keep in mind the old rule of “show, don’t tell.”
Make your characters and scenes as interesting as you can. Try to work
as many senses as possible into descriptions. Think about how novelists do it, and follow their example. (All right, it is possible to overdo
it — you’ll ﬁgure that out when your players start nodding oﬀ.)
• Players know only what you tell them, so don’t expect them to
use a clue later that you don’t give them a chance to ﬁnd now.
• Have the players come up with a situation that you know is not in
the book? Flip to the generic diﬃculties descriptions (if you’ve nowhere
else to start) or the generic modiﬁers (if you already have a diﬃculty).
Then pick a number based on the descriptions therein and go with it.
You can also use this technique to reward player ingenuity.
• Hide the adventure’s text or notes, so your players don’t know
whether you’re changing something. It also increases the level of
suspense and excitement, because they don’t know what’s going to
happen next.
• Adjust the dice totals to make sure that neither side trounces
the other too fast (although sometimes, that just can’t be helped,
so you have to add a few more henchmen, swarms of rats, or a sudden gas trap).
• Keep a few appropriate ﬁller obstacles handy, like game characteristics for henchmen, rolling boulders, booby traps, critter swarms,
zombies, or whatever, for those times when you need to slow the
players down. Also, have a list of suitable helpers, such as a lost key

in a niche, some handy berry bushes, a reformed thug, or a talkative
child, just in case the players need a hand.
• Don’t give your villains more ﬁrepower (or damage-dealing devices
or abilities) than could kill a player’s character in a single blow.
• Never let a player’s character die unless doing so is particularly
dramatic or heroic. Your characters come and go, but players use only
one or two, so they invest a lot more into their development.
• Give new players leeway, but show players who persistently
make bad choices for their characters that there are consequences
to their actions.
• When there’s tension between the players, call for a break. It
might be as simple as getting a snack, or as challenging as reminding
the players that they are not their characters and they’re supposed
to have fun together.
• If you need to encourage players to get into their characters, give
them immediate, but small, rewards for doing so, such as a bonus to
a skill roll or a reduction in diﬃculty.
• Customize your scenarios to the skill levels, character options,
backgrounds, and goals of the players’ characters, as well as the kinds
of things that the players like (particular types of rewards, jokes, villains, and so on). The players will feel like they’re actually participating
in creating the story, rather than being dragged along.

CHAPTER XVII

• Adventure Tips •
What’s in this Chapter
The key means of play in a roleplaying game is the adventure. Thus,
here’s a chapter devoted to some tips on preparing and running adventures, including obstacle ideas, rewards, and generic characters.

Genre Options
The system and information in D6 Fantasy suits two types of
fantasy subgenres: high and low. The primary diﬀerence between the
two lies in the amount of magic available, which in turn aﬀects the
types of characters played and monsters encountered.

High Fantasy
Myths, legends, and magic are the keywords in a high fantasy
campaign. Magic is common, ranging from every village having its
own wizard or witch, to certain castes or groups limiting spell casting
to their members. Often, the characters are larger-than-life heroes
who are battling an even larger foe. Good and evil are living entities,
and quests are popular adventure hooks.

Low Fantasy
A low fantasy world is much more “gray” than high fantasy. Magic
is mysterious, and spells are diﬃcult to cast (represented by a higher
base Spell Total). Monsters are dangerous and often few and far
between. Not everyone in the world is either good or evil, and the
players’ characters may be of mixed morality.

Creating Adventures
Like most games, roleplayers must overcome a series of obstacles
to reach a ﬁnal goal. But in roleplaying games, that combination of
obstacles and goals, called an adventure, takes on the same structure
as a story. Both have an exposition, progressively more diﬃcult challenges to overcome, a climax, and a resolution. You can use movies,
television shows, novels, or comic books to come up with ideas for
adventures, always remembering that the players get to decide how
their characters react to the given obstacle, instead of their actions
being dictated by the writer.
You, the gamemaster, choose the hurdles the characters must
deal with. You provide a goal and then present the characters with a
series of problems that prevents them from reaching that objective.
The hindrances can take a variety of forms, from monsters to evil
viziers to sand storms to secret societies, depending on the genre
and the particular circumstances of the adventure your characters
are working through.

Types of Adventures
The most direct way of creating an adventure is to select the goal
ﬁrst. Once you know the end, you can more easily decide on what
types of obstacles make it interesting for the characters to reach
the goal.
Caught in a Tight Spot: Escape from a situation that could cause
some type of harm to the characters or their allies.
Contest: The characters must accomplish a predetermined goal
more quickly or more eﬃciently than everyone else involved in the
contest.
Guard Duty: Protect someone or something from harm.
Foil a Plan: Stop someone else from accomplishing their goal.
Generally, the plan to be foiled has something to do with the destruction of a person, place, or thing of importance to the characters or
to the entire world.
Mystery: The players’ characters must discover the truth about
a person, thing, or event.
The Quest: Locate and retrieve an object or person at the behest
of another. It could be a stolen object, the person kidnapped, or a
criminal who’s escaped justice.

Chapter 17

Types of Obstacles
Once you’ve determined the type of adventure you want to create, you must divide it up into smaller chunks called scenes, each
containing one or two obstacles. A scene is triggered by the players’
characters’ arrival at a given location or by the passage of time. Once
the characters overcome or bypass the obstacle, they move on to the
next scene and one step closer to the goal of the adventure. Here are
a few examples.
Adverse Conditions: Weather, terrain, monsters, and hostile or
uncooperative gamemaster’s characters can hamper the characters
in accomplishing the goal.
Gamemaster’s Characters: The people that the player’s characters
meet come in handy for all sorts of situations, so much so that there’s
a whole section on them in this chapter.
Combat: In order to continue forward or get
to something, the characters ﬁrst must defeat a
creature or villain.
Diversions: Include extraneous details in
setting descriptions or when the players’ characters talk to other people. The details are more
for show than to further the adventure, but they oﬀer
some interesting roleplaying opportunities.
Information: The players’ characters often need to
obtain information, and you can make this more challenging by making it harder for them to ﬁnd (two guards to
convince instead of one), missing (part of a needed tablet has
been destroyed), in the form of a puzzle or riddle, from a questionable source, or giving the characters what seems like a right lead
but ends up being to the wrong place. However, make sure that the
information the characters seek really is attainable. Be careful not
to force the players’ characters to go through an enormous amount
of trouble based on clues and hints you’ve given them only to ﬁnd
that their eﬀorts were wasted.
Multiple Goals: Typically for experienced roleplayers, adding
the rumor of a new goal can force the characters to rearrange their
priorities.
Restrictions: The characters can’t use some of the regular equipment or must be certain to perform certain rituals, or there will be
dire consequences.
Time Limits: There’s nothing like a time limit to speed up a
scene. This kind of obstacle can take the form of limited supplies,
deteriorating weaponry, or a set amount of time before something
horrible occurs.

Gamemaster’s Characters
During their adventures, players’ characters encounter various
allies, enemies, neutrals, and monsters who serve to shape the story,
establishing the setting or helping or hindering the characters at critical
moments. Without these characters, nothing much would happen.
However, you don’t have to create enough characters to ﬁll the
entire universe. Save yourself work and carefully choose which gamemaster’s characters play the most pivotal roles in your adventure
and design them in detail. Then select the less important characters
and determine most of their background and personality, and so on
until you come down to the nameless characters who need nothing
more than a brief mention.

• Page 122

Assigning Characteristics
Once you’ve come up with the overall concept for the character
or monster, you should decide on his game statistics. Skim through
the “Character Basics” and “Character Options” chapters for some
ideas, jotting down whatever details are important for the character’s
importance to the adventure and what’s needed to use him. There’s
no need to follow the character creation rules exactly; instead, give
each character or monster what you think he needs to play his part
in the story.
The average adult Human has 2D in all attributes, with 3D or
4D in one or two attributes in which you feel the character should
be comparable to the players’ characters. Depending on how much
experience you want an individual to have, give the average character
between 7 and 14 dice in skills.
Children generally have 1D in all attributes, with two or three
dice in skills, such as throwing (for tossing rocks, balls, food, etc.),
running, swimming, hide, bluﬀ, and charm. Older or gifted children may
have more or a greater variety of skills. Children will have few, if any,
specializations. They often carry a favorite toy or nothing.
Elderly adults may have fewer dice in their Agility, Coordination,
and Physique. However, they have twice as many skill dice (between
14 and 20), to account for their greater experience.
Monsters and animals (those creatures that gamemasters wouldn’t
allow players to take as characters) may have a minimum of 1D in
any attribute (generally Intellect and Coordination), but they have
no attribute maximum. Use Disadvantages and Special Abilities as
inspiration for the game mechanics of various natural abilities for
the creature.
Remember that, although clever, most animals and some monsters
are not as intelligent as Humans are. They don’t actively use skills,
though they may have some to represent their unconscious use of
them, such as mettle to resist being told what to do. Animals and
monsters usually decide on the best course of action that will lead
to their own survival, unless they are trained otherwise.
Body Points for generic characters likewise depend on age and
toughness. For base Body Points, use these guidelines: 5 for kids
and elderly individuals, 10 for ordinary innocent bystanders and
most animals, 15 for minor villainous opponents, and 20 for major
secondary and leading gamemaster’s characters. Add to these values
any additional points as you deem appropriate.
Should you prefer the Wounds system, be sure
to drop one or more levels from the bottom of
the list. For example, most animals, kids, and
elderly would take one Wound level (Incapacitated) before dying, while minor character and
large animals might take two (Stunned and
Incapacitated), and so on.

Character Points and Fate Points
Cannon-fodder villains, such as army troops, henchmen, and
merchants, typically have no Character Points or Fate Points. Minor
villains, whose survival isn’t dependent upon the adventure’s plot
may have one to three Character Points and (usually) no Fate Points.
Continuing villains, such as those who may be used for several adventures or who are subordinate to the main villain, may have several
Character Points and no more than one or two Fate Points.

Adventure Tips
Major villains who might
be used over the course of a
campaign and are integral to
an adventure should have at
least 11 Character Points (some
characters may have well over 50
Character Points) and many will
have at least three Fate Points.

Starting the
Adventure
Once you’ve got the goal and a
few obstacles, you’ll need to give the
players’ characters a reason to go
on the adventure. Often called the
hook, here are a few examples.
Character Goals: The group,
even just one of the players’ characters, gets information that could
help get then closer to a long-term
goal.
Informant: Someone
lets the players’ characters know about the goal
and gives them just enough
information to get to the ﬁrst
obstacle. The information could
be provided as a letter, a town
crier’s announcement, a posted
ﬂier, or an anonymous source.
In Medias Res: Start the game
in the middle of an explosive or
suspenseful event. Such fast starts
put the players immediately on
their toes, thrusting their characters into the middle of the game
before they even know it. Once
they’ve dealt with their immediate
problem, they’re thoroughly enmeshed in
the story.
Mission Brieﬁng: The organization
in which the
characters are involved calls a meeting and sets reveals the goal
(though, of course, not how to accomplish it!).

Running Adventures
You’ve successfully brought the players’ characters into the adventure. Now you have to keep them focused and enthralled with the plot.
If you see their eyes start to wander, or they fall into a conversation
about the last game (or worse, what the watched on television last
night), you know something’s gone wrong. This section should help
you maintain an involving story and a sense of “really being there.”

Setting the Scene
Your ﬁrst job is to vividly depict the scene unfolding before the
players’ characters. Where are they? Who else is there? What’s happening? These are the questions you must answer immediately.

• Page 123

Description
The key here is to engage the players’
senses, just like a good movie, novel, or
television show. Try to use evocative
words to give the players a clear and
vivid view of their characters’ environment. The best way to learn how to
provide such lifelike descriptions is
to picture the scene in your mind
and do whatever you can to convey
that same scene to your players. You
may incorporate movie or television
footage you’ve taped, maps and
diagrams you copied out of library
books, or even illustrations you’ve
drawn yourself. Sound eﬀects CDs
especially can help you set the stage
for the characters.
Just remember that your players have ﬁve senses. Don’t just rely
on the sense of sight. Describe
what your characters hear, smell, touch,
and (sometimes) taste. The following
example engages several senses.

Gamemaster: “The thick, musty
smell of swamp begins to permeate
the air. From all around you, you
can hear the screeching chirps
of birds and small animals.
The humidity settles against
your skin like a blanket
of moisture as you continue trudging forward
on the increasingly squishy
ground. The gangly gray
trees scattered in small
stands reach upward into
the mist, and you get the
distinct feeling that something
out there is watching you.”

Believable Characters
Other than the setting, the players’ characters will also encounter
other people who live in the game world. Your job is to make sure
that these gamemaster’s characters appear real to the players. Their
words and actions must seem appropriate in the context of their
histories, personalities, and ambitions. If a stoic military oﬃcer
suddenly took oﬀ his helmet and started joking around, the players
would probably just stare at you for a minute as the game comes
crashing to a halt.
Play each character to the best of your ability. Make sure he does
everything in his power to achieve his goals, whether he’s trying to
thwart the players’ characters or earn a load of gold coins. This does
not mean that each gamemaster’s character should act overtly. Part of
his goal may be to achieve his objective undetected, or to make it look
like someone else was responsible. Rather, the idea is that the character

Chapter 17
should use all of his resources — his skills, allies, ﬁnances, and so on
— to accomplish his immediate as well as his long-term goals.

Exciting Locales
Try to make each place the players’ characters visit seem diﬀerent
than the others. By doing this, you can make these sights engaging
and memorable for the players.

Personal Stake
Every once in while you should ask to see the players’ character
sheets. Look for background information and personality traits that
might lend themselves to a personal stake. If a player has written that
her character is extremely competitive, for example, you could create a
rival group that seeks to outdo the players’ characters at every turn. The
players will do everything in their power to make sure their characters
succeed more often and more quickly than the newcomers.

Giving Options
Don’t constantly force your players to follow along the prescribed
path of the adventure. They may have devised an alternate scheme
for success not covered by the scenario, and you shouldn’t penalize
them for their creativity. Instead you’ll have to use your judgment
to run the remainder of the adventure.
If the players feel that they never have a choice, that you have
predetermined what their characters will do and say — and therefore, how the adventure will turn out — they’re not going to have
any interest in playing. Part of the fun of a roleplaying game is the
almost unlimited possible reactions to any given situation. Take
that away, and you’ve lost much of the reason for participating in
this type of game.
Sometimes the characters will have only a few choices — or at
least, a few obvious choices — and that’s ﬁne if it makes logical sense
in the context of the scenario and doesn’t seem like an attempt by
you as the gamemaster to dictate their characters’ paths.
Reward creativity. Give the players a reason to exercise their brains.
The more freedom they believe they have, the more they’ll enjoy the
adventure. When their characters make a mistake, they have no one
else to blame it on, and when their characters succeed, they feel a
genuine sense of accomplishment.

The Subtle Art of Misdirection
If the players can correctly guess the conclusion of an adventure
while they’re progressing through the ﬁrst encounter, the ensuing
encounters won’t provide as much excitement as they should.
This is where the subtle art of misdirection comes in. The object
here is to keep the players (and their characters) guessing and revising those guesses through the whole adventure. You can do this in
small ways: Make die rolls, smile for a moment, and then don’t say
anything about it; have the characters roll Acumen checks, ask for
their totals, and then just continue with the encounter; ask a player
for detailed information on how her character is going to close a
door (“Which hand are you using?” “Do you have a weapon in your
hand?”), but then have the portal close uneventfully.
You also have the option of throwing in major red herrings. If
a character starts tracking the players’ characters, the players will
immediately attempt to mesh this new person’s presence with the

• Page 124
rest of the adventure. In reality, however, he’s just a common thief
looking for an easy mark, or he thinks that one of the characters
looks familiar but doesn’t want to say anything until he’s sure he’s
not mistaking that character for someone else.

Allowing the Characters to Fail
It’s that chance of failure that gives excitement to a roleplaying
game, so sometimes characters need to fail. If they roll poorly, or
are simply outclassed, or most importantly, if they play poorly, their
characters will not accomplish their goal.
Yet, with each defeat, the characters (and players) should learn
something. They may learn a better way to approach a situation, or
they may stumble upon a tool or gadget that will help them in the
future. It should take perseverance and dedication, but learning from
mistakes will eventually lead to success.

Getting Feedback
Sometimes an adventure doesn’t thrill the players like you expected
it to when you were ﬁrst reading or creating it. As you run a scenario,
try to pay attention to the players’ reactions to the various scenes.
Did they stand up and all try to talk at once during the puzzle-solving
encounter? Did they go comatose when they reached the chase? Gauge
their reactions to your judgment calls and improvisation. The players’
words and actions can convey a great deal of information about what
they enjoyed most (and probably would like to see more of).
Ask the players what they did and didn’t like. You could even have
them write you an anonymous note with a list of their favorite and
least favorite scenes.
Don’t take any negative responses as criticism. It takes a lot of
work to plan and run a game, and you can’t always please everyone no

Adventure Tips
matter what you do. Just don’t forget to listen to what your players
have to say. They may want to take the game in a diﬀerent direction
than you do. Compromise. Make sure you and your players have fun.
If not, either you or your players will eventually give up and ﬁnd
something else to do during those precious spare moments. View
player reactions and comments as hints for what you can do in the
next adventure that will keep them on the edge of their seats.

Rewarding the Players
Part of the fun of roleplaying is watching characters improve and
develop. Gamemasters have plenty of options for helping that along,
though, of course, no single option should be overused or the players
will have no reason to continue adventuring.

Character Options
Look through the list of Advantages for some reward ideas.
Typically, when a gamemaster allows access to an Advantage, it’s
a one-shot deal, especially for particularly powerful Advantages,
such as being owed a favor by a king. If the characters want a more
permanent access to this kind of Advantage, they will have pay for
it (in Character Points).
Gamemasters might also give free Advantages to characters
— along with an equivalent amount of Disadvantages!

Equipment and Other Loot

• Page 125

ously, more experienced characters will either have to experience
more adventures, or they’ll need bigger challenges.
Here are a few guidelines for distributing Character and Fate
Points for an adventure that lasts two or more nights, several hours
per night. They are per character, not per group.
Obstacle was easy to overcome (the diﬃculty numbers were
about three times the die code in the skills required): No reward.
Obstacle was somewhat diﬃcult to overcome (the diﬃculty numbers were about three to four times the die code in the
skills required): 1 Character Point per low-diﬃculty obstacle in the
adventure.
Obstacle was quite challenging to overcome (the diﬃculty
numbers were about ﬁve times the die code in the skills required;
generally reserved for the climactic scene): 2 or more Character
Points per high-diﬃculty obstacle in the adventure (depending on
how many Character Points the characters had to spend to beat the
diﬃculties set).
Individual roleplaying (overcoming goals and playing in character): 2 to 3 Character Points (awarded to each character, not to
the whole group).
Group roleplaying (teamwork and interacting with each other
in character): 3 to 4 Character Points.
Everybody had fun (including the gamemaster): 1 to 2 Character Points.
Accomplished the goal: 1 Fate Point.

Depending on the circumstances of the present adventure and
the gamemaster’s ideas for future adventures, gamemasters may
allow the players’ characters to keep equipment, gear, and treasure
that they ﬁnd in abandoned temples or acquire from a villain’s lair.
Gamemasters may even want to plant various items in the adventure
for the players’ characters to locate, whether to fulﬁll a character’s
dream or help the group in a future scenario. Should the equipment
or other material cause the players’ characters to become too powerful, too quickly, remember that things can break, become the object
of desire by more powerful personages, or get stolen.

Characters might choose to sell some of their loot and put the
money into their investments or royal vaults. Depending on what
characters do with their money, gamemasters may allow a permanent
one-pip increase to each of their Funds attribute (because of putting
it into solid investments as determined by a trading roll), or give the
characters a larger bonus to a limited number of Funds rolls (because
they kept the cash in a vault at their hideout).

Information
While not terribly tangible, information could be useful for drawing
the characters into another adventure or helping to fulﬁll a character’s
goal (such as discovering details about her mysterious past).

Character and Fate Points
Assuming that the players have really been trying and have been
suﬃciently challenged by the adventure, each character should receive
enough Character Points to improve one skill, plus a few extra for
help in overcoming a low roll at a future inconvenient time. Obvi-

Generic Standard Difficulties
See Chapter 5 for general task resolution information and other modiﬁers.
Automatic (0): Almost anyone can perform this action; there is
no need to roll. (Generally, this diﬃculty is not listed in a pregenerated
adventure; it is included here for reference purposes.)
Very Easy (1–5): Nearly everyone can accomplish this task.
Typically, tasks with such a low diﬃculty only are rolled when they
are crucial to the scenario.
Easy (6–10): Although characters usually have no diﬃculty with
this task, an untrained character may ﬁnd it challenging.
Moderate (11–15): There is a fair chance that the average character
will fail at this type of task. Tasks of this type require skill, eﬀort, and
concentration.
Diﬃcult (16–20): Those with little experience in the task must
have a lot of luck to accomplish this type of action.
Very Diﬃcult (21–25): The average character only rarely succeeds
at these kinds of task. Only the most talented regularly succeed.
Heroic (26–30), Legendary (31 or more): These kinds of tasks are
nearly impossible, though there’s still a slim chance that lucky average
or highly experienced characters can accomplish them.

D6 Reference Sheet

See pages 60–62 and 68–71 for additional information and modiﬁers.
Determining the Diﬃculty
Base combat diﬃculty = defense total
• Defense total = (passive defense value or active defense value)
plus combat diﬃculty modiﬁers
• Passive defense value = 10
• Active defense value = full defense value or partial defense
value
• Full defense value = any defense skill roll + 10
• Partial defense value = any defense skill roll
Determining Success
If the attacker’s combat skill total plus any modiﬁers equals or exceeds
the target’s defense roll, the attack succeeds and may do damage.
Determining Damage
• Damage total
• For attacks that do damage not modiﬁed by strength: damage
total = roll of weapon damage die code plus damage modiﬁers
• For attacks that do damage modiﬁed by strength: damage total
= roll of weapon damage die code plus character’s Strength Damage
die code plus damage modiﬁers
• Damage resistance total
• Body Points: roll of Armor die code plus defense modiﬁers
• Wounds: roll of Physique plus Armor die code plus defense
modiﬁers
• If the damage total is greater than the damage resistance total,
the target was injured. If the damage total is less than or equal to the
damage resistance total, the target was not injured.
• If the target was injured, subtract the damage resistance total from
the damage total. Then either subtract this from the target’s current
Body Total or compare the value on the “Wound Level” chart.

* If cover provides protection, the attacker cannot hit the target directly,

The gamemaster may decide that such factors as experience, strength,
and features of the weapon (such as a well-balanced sword) lower this
modiﬁer.

Strength Damage
To ﬁgure the Strength Damage die code, drop the pips from the
character’s Physique or lifting die code (but include any Disadvantages
or Special Abilities), divide the number by 2, and round up.

*Note: Penalties imposed by each level are not cumulative and they are
not included when determining the resistance total or damage done by nonstrength-based weapons. Any additional damage less than or equal to the
character’s current level moves the character up by one level.
**A character moves to the Severely Wounded level if the diﬀerence is
between 4 and 8 and she already has the Wounded level.
†Note: This is an optional chart for use with Body Points. The “Body Points
Left” column is based on the character’s maximum Body Points. Round so
no overlap exists between levels. Penalties imposed by each level are not
cumulative; do not include them when determining the stun or damage
resistance total or any total not involving a skill or attribute.
Stunned: Either receives -1D for all remaining actions this round
and next round or may only defend or retreat in the next round.
Wounded: -1D to all actions until healed.
Severely Wounded: -2D on all actions until healed.
Incapacitated: As a free action before losing consciousness, he
may try to stay up with a Moderate (15) stamina roll. If the character
succeeds, he may continue to act, but all actions have a -3D penalty. If
he fails, he is knocked out for 10D minutes.
Mortally Wounded: The character is near death and knocked
unconscious with no chance to keep up. Roll the character’s Physique
each round, the character ﬁnally dying if the roll is less than the number
of minutes a character’s been Mortally Wounded.
Dead: The character has perished.

Combat Summary

• Page 141

• Die Code Simplification •
As characters progress, often the number of dice players have to
roll and add becomes daunting. With this in mind, this chart provides
two ways of reducing the amount of dice needed.
The fast way is to roll ﬁve dice, including the Wild Die, add the
results, and then add the die code’s pips and a bonus number. To
determine the bonus number, ﬁnd the die code (ignoring the pips)
of the original attribute, skill, weapon, or other value in the “Die
Code” column. Then read across to the “5D” column to get the bonus
number.
Example: A character has a Natural Ranged Weapon that does
30D of damage. Instead of rolling 30 dice, the player rolls ﬁve and
adds 88 to the total on the dice.
The faster way is to roll only the Wild Die, adding to its result the
corresponding bonus listed in the “Wild Die” column of the chart.

Example: A character has a skill with a value of 10D. The gamemaster rolls the Wild Die and adds 32 to the result.
When using only the Wild Die, a Critical Failure only indicates a
complication or funny thing happening; it does not aﬀect the total
rolled.
Because Character Points function similar to a Wild Die, roll any
dice gained from Character Point expenditure separately. When
using Fate Points on a roll, double the original die code and use that
to determine the bonus number.
For bonus numbers beyond the 50D level for the “5D” column, subtract 5 from the die code and multiply the number by 3.5. Round up.
To get bonus numbers beyond the 50D level for the “Wild Die”
column, subtract 1 from the die code and multiply the number by
3.5. Round up.
