• Introduction •
Our scholars have worked diligently
to bring you information on over 80
diﬀerent types of creatures — from
alligators to Zombies. Of course, don’t
feel that because we’ve included it in
this tome that you need to add every
creature to your setting.
Take note that the entries provide
information on the typical member
of the species, and that’s not always
the one that stalwart adventurers
will run across. While the entries can
serve well as a guide, it’s always worth
remembering that any speciﬁc creature
encountered may have abilities above,
below, or outside the norm — perhaps
even ones never seen in that species
before due to some twist of magical or
divine intervention.
We also wish to bring to your attention the following information that is
applicable to numerous creatures found
in this book.

What You’ll Need
You’ll get the most out of this book
if you’ve already read (or at least own)
the D6 Fantasy Rulebook. However, we’ve
included a genre conversion at the end
of this book for those who’d like to use
these critters in D6 Adventure or D6
Space encounters.

Animals vs.
Sentient Beings
You’ll notice that game characteristics are given in one of two ways: with
natural abilities and with Advantages,
Disadvantages, and Special Abilities.
This is to help you distinguish between
those with animal instincts only (which
are the ones with natural abilities) and
everyone else.

Animal Skills
Remember that, although clever,
most animals and some monsters
are not as intelligent as Humans are.
They don’t actively use skills, though

they may have some to represent their
unconscious application of them, such
as mettle to resist being told what to do.
Animals and monsters usually decide on
the best course of action that will lead
to their own survival, unless they are
trained otherwise.

Creatures and
Their Fear Factor
Animals and similar creatures often
try to scare interlopers in their territories, either to weaken them or
frighten them away. To simulate this,
the gamemaster may have the creature
make a threatening gesture and make
an intimidation attempt. Since the
intimidation attempt is an instinctual
reaction, it only may be performed once
per encounter, but it aﬀects all who
witness it. For example, bears rear and
often growl or roar, while a bull stamps
its hooves and tosses its horns.
Should the intimidation attempt succeed, the target character or group ﬂees,
possibly pursued by the creature if it is
hungry or provoked enough.
For more details of the game mechanics of intimidation attempts, see page
73 of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook.

Stampede
Some animals, such as cattle and
elephants, become even more dangerous when in enraged or frightened as a
group. A stampeding herd does standard
Strength Damage (with any modiﬁers
for the ability to trample) plus receives
+5 to ﬁghting for one round per ﬁve to
20 animals in the group. (The larger the
animal, the fewer that need to participate to receive this bonus.)

Scale
Many of the creatures in this book
include a scale value. (Those that don’t
have a scale value of zero.) Scale takes
into account that large creatures are
easier to hit but harder to injure, while

small creatures are harder to hit but easier to injure. For information on how to
use scale in your combat encounters, see
page 71 of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook.

Increased
Attribute Special
Ability
You’ll notice that some creatures have
a bonus in parentheses after attributes
and Strength Damage values. This
number in parentheses indicates the
modiﬁer that the creature receives from
having the Increased Attribute Special
Ability for the related characteristic.

Disadvantages
The eﬀects of the Reduce Attribute
and the Hindrance: Movement Disadvantages have been ﬁgured into the
characteristics of the creatures, so do
not apply them again.

Animal Control
To keep a sense of balance in a game,
gamemaster should restrict Animal
Control to ordinary creatures (such as
birds or cattle) and disallow its use on
the more unusual creatures and monsters (such as perytons and giant bats).
Additionally, characters many not use
Animal Control to hold power over any
creature with Advantages, Disadvantages, and/or Special Abilities in their
write-ups or where otherwise noted.

Designer Creatures
Monsters and animals (those creatures that gamemasters wouldn’t allow
players to take as characters) may have
a minimum of 1D in any attribute (generally Intellect and Coordination), but
they have no attribute maximum. Use
Disadvantages and Special Abilities as
inspiration for the game mechanics of
various natural abilities for the creature.
You can ﬁnd a sheet to keep track of your
modiﬁed and new monsters on page 127
of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook.

Alligator,
Crocodile
Lizards of ancient age and graceful
danger, the alligator and its saltwater
cousin the crocodile fulﬁll an important niche in a wetlands and swamp
ecology, preying on ﬁsh, birds, insects,
mammals, and other creatures. Often
found in packs of ﬁve to 20, they are
surprisingly gregarious and raise their
young with an apparent loving kindness.
Stealthy and deadly in water, they also
can make surprising bursts of speed
on land. While in water they clamp
down on prey with powerful jaws and
thrash around their own axis, rending
the prey apart.
Some unusual cultures raise these
creatures as pets and guards or for
sporting events in which contestants
wrestle the annoyed beasts. They also
are harvested for their tasty meat and
hides, which make excellent and sturdy
clothing and accessories.
Bards tell of an ancient King of the
Gators, a beast of cunning intelligence
and gigantic size, which can make even
dragons quake with fear. Legend has it
that the Gator King will one day devour
everything in the world, leaving himself
to eternally starve. The Gator King is said
to live in the bubbling acid swamps at

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

the Edge of the World, where foul slimes
and oozes feast on hideous birds and
cackling hags.
But those who dare the swamps and
avoid the souls of the dead trapped in
the rotting timbers of the moss-choked
trees can ﬁnd the treasures of ages past.
Lost in this place are artifacts created
by uncaring gods and discarded like old
clothing; remains of fabulous heroes and
foolish merchants, staves of powerful
wizards and holy wards of great priests,
and dangerous technology of other
realms. The swamps are disconnected
from time and space, warping into and
out of existence like light glancing oﬀ a
soap bubble. Great castles and donjons,
ancient conveyances and small villages,
strange creatures and bizarre weather all
haunt the Edge of the World Swamps.
Quick death awaits those who step into
rapidsand or get tangled in the bloodsucking vines of the willow trees.
Some foolish ones say the Gator King
is a poor, trapped soul — bound into a
curse not of his own making, hoping
for deliverance. But woe to any foolish
enough to think they can overcome the
Gator King’s all-consuming appetite!
To those who can ﬁnd deliverance for
the Gator King, the rewards of the gods
awaits. Several ancient scrolls tell of
theories on how to survive the swamps
and appease the Gator King. Scattered

around the world, they merely await
collection by a brave group of heroes
determined to answer the ancient
mystery of the Gator King.

Giant Bat
Giant cave bats are one of the more
prevalent dangers in caverns and
abandoned dungeons, and those who
travel by night through certain parts
of the land are learning to fear the loud
screech and the beating of leathern
wings that presages the arrival of these
creatures.
Giant cave bats average one meter
in length, with wing spans up to 2.5
meters. They live in tunnels and caverns,
emerging at night to hunt for food. They
tend to feast on large prey, such as sheep,
cattle, and humanoids. They attack in
swarms of up to 20, forcing their victim
to the ground and eating him alive.
Giant cave bats use a powerful sonar
to enable themselves to navigate. They
rely on stealth to allow them to approach
an enemy undetected, and will carry
prey home if to is small enough. Otherwise, they simply eat their ﬁll and leave
the rest for scavengers.
Interestingly enough, cave bat
victims often seek the creatures out!
Among Earth and Air Giants, particularly, giant cave bat meat is considered
a delicacy, and many a Giant has braved
caverns in various parts of the land on
a hunt. Goblins and orcs like the meat
as well as the hides, and they often seek
cave bat lairs. Some pay dearly, in trades
or information, for directions to one.
Of course, if they are feeling especially
malicious, they may ask someone seeking information to actually slay the bats
and bring them back in exchange for the
answers they need.

Even more deadly
are the hell bats, which
thrive on darkness
and hate the touch
of light. They spend
the daytime hours
asleep in vast caverns, emerging after
dark to carry out
the wishes of their
masters. Hell bats are
humanoid-shaped
creatures, 2.5 meters
in height, ebony in
hue, with jet-black
wings and crimson eyes. Their
wingspans reach ﬁve meters in length.
Wickedly sharp claws extend from their
hands to allow them to disembowel
their victims.
The attack of a hell bat is easy to distinguish from that of any other creature.
Its distaste for light will lead it to attempt
to extinguish any source of light in the
possession of its victims, either through
physical action or the use of its natural
magick. Once its prey is trapped in darkness, the hell bat emits a piercing shriek
to freeze them with fear, and then it
strikes with startling swiftness.
Hell bats are relentless ﬁghters, relying
on speed, cunning, and strength to carry
the battle. They normally attack solo,
although as many as two of the creatures
have been seen to work together.

Bear
The bear is one of the most renowned
creatures of the wild. Though generally
considered slow, lumbering animals
by the casual observer, they are in fact
quick when motivated. Combined with
their very powerful physique, bears
are dangerous adversaries. This makes
them a favorite companion of druids
and shamans, serving as guardians and
sometimes mounts.
Black bears are one of the smallest
kinds of bear, weighing in at about 135
kilograms and roughly 1.2 to 1.5 meters
from nose to tail. The brown, or “grizzly,”
bear is generally 225 to 270 kilograms
and 1.8 to 2.1 meters long. As the largest
of their species, polar bears can weight
over 540 kilograms and measure up to
three meters long. When standing on
their hind legs, take their length and add
half again to determine the approximate
height any bear can reach.
While bears are mainly carnivores,
they can and will eat nearly anything.
Black and brown bears will eat all manner of plant matter, including berries,
roots, and bulbs. Some brown bears go
after big game such as elk and moose,
but most prefer ﬁsh and small game.
Polar bears almost exclusively dine on
seals and other arctic wildlife.

When they are very hungry or feel
unthreatened, bears scavenge campsites. Driven by a powerful sense of
smell, a bear will even claw open sealed
pottery jars, or bash them on hard
objects. Those who feel clever by hanging
their supplies in trees will receive a rude
awaking by black bears, who are excellent climbers, and persistent grizzlies,
who will shake or knock down trees to
get at these scrumptious treats.
Most bears do not attack humans
unless it is necessary. Mother bears are
notorious for going out of their way to
protect young. A mother bear protecting her young gains a +2D bonus to her
ﬁghting and damage, and she does not
engage in any defensive actions, such
as dodging or retreating.

Typical Black Bear
Agility 2D+2: climbing 4D+2, ﬁghting

Adventurers report unusually
large subjects of each species. These
bears are about 50% larger than
their respective cousins and gain a
+1D to Physique and ﬁghting as well
as +1 to their scale value.

D6 Fantasy Creatures

Bird of
Prey
Predatory birds, or raptors, are some
of the world’s most eﬃcient hunters.
With amazing eyesight, they can spot
small prey, such as rodents and other
birds, from a mile away. Diving from
great height they reach incredible
speeds, sometimes in excess of 320 kilometers per hour, and snare their victims
eﬃciently with razor-sharp talons.
The smallest of the raptors is the
hawk, which comes in many varieties
including the falcon and goshawk. The
falcon generally attacks other birds and
is the smaller of the two, weighing only
one-half to two kilograms with a wingspan of about one meter. The goshawk
is slightly bigger, weighing about 1.4
to 1.8 kilograms with a wingspan of
1.2 meters. It hunts small mammals on
the ground including mice, squirrels,
and rabbits. Both are used in falconry,
the art of training and hunting with
raptors.
In falconry, a captive raptor’s eyes
are covered with a hood and the fal-

•

Page 7

coner engages in a process of bonding
with the bird through gentle speaking,
careful stroking of the feathers, and
reward with food. Once the bond is
formed the falconer can train the hawk
to hunt prey. The falcon is primarily
used by nobles to hunt with because it
kills its prey with a quick, clean blow to
the spine and neck that many view as a
more honorable means of dispatching a
foe. The goshawk is a peasant’s hunting
bird. With its more aggressive nature,
it eviscerates prey if left unattended
for too long. Basically, it has a habit of
ruining a good meal.
Eagles are signiﬁcantly larger birds,
about 4.5 to 6.8 kilograms with a wingspan of 1.8 to 2.4 meters. This gives
them the power to hunt larger prey,
snatch shallow-water ﬁsh, or compete
for fresh kill from other birds. Eagles
also scavenge for carrion, so when they
can’t get fresh food, they willingly feast
on any carcass left behind after a hunt or
battle. Typically they are not trainable,
except by rare or magical means.
When soaring, using thermal layers
in the air to stay aloft, a raptor can
ﬂy for hundreds of kilometers before
resting.

boars are aggressive ﬁghters, the elder
giant boar is far craftier in battle. Having survived the violent adult years, the
elder, typically over 40 or 50 years old,
has learned much from its encounters
with other beings. They have been
known to dig pits with their tusks to
trap hunters, lure attackers past nests
of poisonous snakes, and goad knights
into charging them near cliﬀ edges.
The pelt of Elder Giant Boars, which
are silver gray, are valued at two to four
times that of the brown or black pelts
of the adult. The bristles of the pelt
don’t take well to dyeing, and are very
distinctive, so counterfeiting is diﬃcult.
Tales of a white, or albino, giant boar
have been told, but none has ever been
killed or captured.

Typical Giant Boar

Giant Boar
The giant boar is the one of the greatest prizes that any hunter can seek.
Throughout legend, kings, wizards, and
gods have tasked heroes with slaying
this monstrous beast for their banquet
tables. However, many overconﬁdent
and greedy fools have perished on such
quests, as this creature does not take
well to being anyone’s prey.
It is not without reason that the giant
boar is so hunted. Each boar, being
about 1,580 kilograms and measuring
the size of a fully grown rhinoceros,
can destroy an entire crop in a matter
of days or make grazing lands barren
in weeks. Moreover, they are hostile
and charge a mounted knight with no
hesitation, much less a group of farmers or herders. Females, during mating
season, also destroy houses and farms

Bogie
Bogies are small creatures that
resemble pointed-eared, gray-skinned
Leprechauns in peasant clothing. They
have been known to appear as large
clouds of dust. Bogies have ﬁngers that
end in points that allow them to burrow
in the soil.
These mischievous sprites are distantly related to Leprechauns, but the
two races give each other a wide berth.
(Leprechauns consider Bogies to be
humorless Trolls.) Bogies are solitary
creatures, although occasionally two
will live together for company for a
short while.
Daylight brings out the wickedness
in these creatures. During this time, if
they are prevented from returning to
their subterranean homes, they become
increasingly irritable, short tempered,
and mean. In combat, Bogies use their
farming implements for maximum damage. During the night, they are in better

spirits but still mischievous and enjoy
playing pranks on beings larger than
themselves. Some of their typical pranks
include: tying shoelaces together, stealing and hiding small objects, writing
humiliating messages on victims while
they are sleep and placing a victim’s
hand in a bowl of warm water. They like
to hide in cupboards and closets where,
if they are not found, they sometimes
fall asleep.
Bogies are found in temperate
regions, especially forests and farms.
The creatures sometimes make deals
with woodcutters and farmers, but they
are notoriously poor negotiators and
often get the bad end of the deal.
Bogies enjoy vegetables of all types,
though they can subsist on almost any
plant matter. If captured or charmed,
they can be a great source of information for the immediate area. They always
know where the best roots are located,
and they often know interesting details
of local history.

Bogle
From the dawn of time, people
have used tales of lurking “bogles” to
make children behave. These relatively
harmless tools of parenting may seem
innocuous, but bogles are real and very,
very dangerous. Bogles originate in a
shadowy dimension separated from
ours by a barrier called, among other
names, the Veil. Bogles cannot breach
this barrier — unless they get help from
the other side, that is.
The bogles’ path to carnage lies in
fear, but not the kind felt by a thief
about to be caught by guards, or that
experienced by a shy person making a
speech in front of a crowd. Bogles are
only drawn to irrational, paralyzing terror, such as might be felt by a conscripted
soldier about to go into combat for the
ﬁrst time, or by a child who has heard
too many scary bedtime stories. When
parents frighten their children in the
name of social decorum, when grown
men surrender their wits to the numbing spread of total fear, they unwittingly
open a window in the Veil. If they are
very unfortunate, a bogle will be there,
staring back at them...
It is far too easy to make children
believe in monsters. Belief leads to fear,
and fear feeds the insatiable appetite of

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

the bogle. Left unchecked, a bogle can
grow strong enough to rend the Veil;
once that happens, its prey is almost
certainly doomed.
Bogles do not possess a solid form on
their side of the Veil, existing instead as
wraith-like essences that drift on ethereal winds, patiently waiting for signs
of prey. Once allowed into this world,
however, bogles take the physical form
of their prey’s deepest fear. Bogles can
appear large or small, fat or skeletal,
hairy or scaled, repulsively hideous or
disarmingly beautiful, recognizably
humanoid or completely alien. Without
a strong source of fear to sustain them,
bogles rapidly weaken and are pulled
back into their own realm by the Veil,
where they wait for the chance to roam
free again. Survivors of bogle attacks are
rare, and, of course, bogle descriptions
vary greatly.
Bogles prey mainly upon people who
can be overwhelmed by fear, which is
why children so often become victims.
Adults, however, are not immune to
bogles, and no one can tell for certain
how many have fallen to these inner killers. For a rare glimpse into the mental
state of victims of a bogle attack, as
well as a hint of the creature’s perceived
form, one museum curator points to a
ﬁre-damaged journal found in a ruined

military outpost. The hastily scrawled
text is mostly unreadable, but mentions
the appearance of an emaciated, diseaseridden girl covered in oozing sores and
dressed in ﬁlthy rags, shortly before
a guard disappeared. Some witnesses
oﬀered conﬂicting descriptions, and
the story was dismissed. More guards
vanished over the next couple of nights,
only to be spotted at dawn outside the
fort, severely mutilated (some people
doubt whether all of these deaths could
have been caused by just one bogle,
but experts agree that “terror” itself
is contagious, and mass hysteria could
have contributed to the lingering presence of a single bogle, which took new
shapes as needed). The account went
on to say that men began to desert
their posts, hoping to escape the terror, but they were always discovered
lying within sight of the fort, broken
and torn like the others. The unnamed
author’s account then rambled for a
bit before concluding with these lines:
“I knew they’d leave me here… all left
me… I can hear the creature now… so
many legs… sound, like something wet
and heavy dragging across the rocks...
Mother, deliver me from…”

Typical Bogle
As bogles can take many forms, no
single set of characteristics can accurately represent them. Therefore, the
composition of the bogle is up to the
gamemaster. Use any entry herein or
base it on any humanoid, adding these
abilities plus any others the victim
thinks the terror would have: life drain
(6 Body Points/1 Would level per round
per successful intimidation attempt);
immortality (returns to its home
dimension when slain); inspire fear (+2
to intimidation totals and -2 to combat
diﬃculties against frightened individuals; Moderate mettle or Charisma roll
to resist); one form (bogle must make
a Moderate mettle roll, which counts
as an action, to keep one form when
confronted by two or more victims;
indicates that the bogle vanishes to
its home dimension). Remember that
bogles are supposed to be frightening
creatures that are hard to defeat.

Bull
The bull is identiﬁed by many cultures
as a symbol of strength and virility
— some consider it sacred. A number
of religious ceremonies use the bull as
a sacriﬁce or in rituals pitting them
against warriors as a test of their bravery. However, despite the mysticism
associated with bulls, the day-to-day use
of these animals is the simple breeding
of livestock.
In any herd of cows, or steers, there
are 20 to 30 bulls per 100 cows in the
wild or traveling with nomadic herders,
but only about ﬁve to 10 bulls on farms
and ranches for a like number of cows. In
this way, farmers and ranchers maintain
control of the population and insure
optimal breeding, as well as to prevent
bulls from injuring one another when
competing for females. They do this by
locking horns. In enclosed settings, like
ranches, they have been known to injure
the cows as well.
Bulls are much larger than cows,
about 1130 kilograms and standing 1.5
meters at the shoulder. A cow is about
680 kilograms by comparison.
The horns of a wild bull average 1.5
meters from tip to tip, but can get as
long as 1.8 to 2.1 meters. Must bulls in
captivity have been bred for small horns
(which can be as short as one-half to one
meter across) or have had their horns
cut oﬀ to prevent injury to people and
beast a like.
Like many herd animals, bulls don’t
generally bother with people unless
they approach too closely. The bull deals
with threat, real or perceived, by a swift
charge, goring of the horns, and trampling under hoof. In a ceremonial battle,
or bullﬁght, the bull is taunted with a
cape or any other large piece of cloth into
charging. It is not the bullﬁghter that is
the target but the cape itself.
The motion of waving the cape creates the perception of the cloth as the
threat; the person holding the cape
is irrelevant to the bull. A talented
bullﬁghter can keep a bull occupied for
several minutes with this technique
and may play to the crowd by putting
his back to the bull or even going to his

knees to “ﬁght” the animal. To perform
this kind of bull taunting, the character
needs training in a specialization of
dodge, called bullﬁghting. Each round,
the ﬁghter makes an intimidation roll
versus the bull’s mettle, in addition to
a dodge: bullﬁghting attempt against the
animal’s Acumen. As the performance
requires both each round, multi-action
penalties apply. Missing the intimidation roll means that the bull does not
charge, while missing the bullﬁghting
attempt indicates that the bull plowed
into the ﬁghter.
Some bullﬁghts require the ﬁghter
to kill the bull or lance it with several
spears in order to ﬁnish the contest.
Once the bull becomes injured, it gets
even more enraged and more diﬃcult
to control. Any bullﬁghting tests made
after the bull is wounded (a loss of more
than ﬁve Body Points or one Would
level) are done against the bull’s mettle
instead of Acumen.
Some ﬁghters like to show oﬀ by moving to the side at the last moment and
placing themselves close enough to the
side of the bull as it rushes past. (This
adds +5 to the bullﬁghting diﬃculty.) It

is a very dangerous but crowd-pleasing
stunt and could, eventually, earn the
character some fame.

Bunyip Summoning
Invocation

Bunyip
Bunyips are the angry animal spirits
of creatures that were slain for sport or
other petty reasons. They have a variety
of shapes, but are always covered in fur,
with two large clawed arms and a ferocious mouth of teeth. They may sometimes have horns, ﬁns, wings, scales, or
other parts of animals that have been
slain in the area. The more animals senselessly killed within the vicinity of their
creation, the larger they are.
The first bunyip is said to have
appeared in a large island-continent far
out in the ocean, but they can be found
near any body of water. an animal killed
and thrown into a water hole has an
excellent change of becoming a bunyip.
During the day, they hide in their
watery lairs. At night, the spirits attack
anything that ventures within two kilometers of its lair, but it will not go beyond
that limit even if the target ﬂees beyond
the area. It prefers humanoid women
over all other targets as the creature
savors the sweet ﬂavor of female ﬂesh.
Shamans that are close to nature have
been known to call on and manipulate
bunyips, but this is extremely dangerous.
If the shaman does not create the miracle
properly or if the bunyip’s potential vic-

tim ﬂees its sphere of inﬂuence, the spirit
attacks its summoner. The spirit’s power
may only be used to avenge slain animals
and the like, so the shaman must word
his request carefully and target victims
even more carefully.
Under other circumstances, bunyips
cannot be reasoned with, and they
attack all until they or it are destroyed.
However, if it manages to kill the person
or persons responsible for its creation or
growth, it disappears with the corpses
of those persons, never to return. The
bodies of these persons are never recovered, though the bloated corpses of its
other victims might be found, laden with
treasure, in the bottom of its den.

Incantation (-2): Carefully worded
request (complex formula with diﬃculty equal to roll of bunyip’s mettle)
Once the shaman seats himself within
one kilometer of the bunyip’s den, he
begins by twirling the bull-roarer over
his head. After its roaring is steadily
produced, he concentrates on summoning the bunyip forth. At the end
of the time and with a successful strife
roll, the bunyip appears. (On a failure,
the bunyip does not appear. On a failure with a Critical Failure, the bunyip
attacks the shaman.) The shaman may
then make his request of the bunyip,
using his persuasion plus the bonus
received from this invocation against
the bunyip’s mettle. (Treat the bunyip
hostile but the request as something
the bunyip would do anyway.) Any kind
of failure to convince the bunyip to follow the shaman’s wishes results in the
bunyip attacking the character.

Cat
Cats are greeted with an air of mysticism and superstition, sometimes
worshiped as gods or reviled as devils.
No other animal is treated so divergently by society, perhaps because it
is a creature that carries itself like one
who keeps secrets. In a magical setting
a cat is cause for great concern.
The common domestic cat is typically
no actual threat to anything more than
a mouse or other rodents and even in
superstitious cultures can be found
roaming within most communities.
Generally only about 33 centimeters
or so long in the body, adults weigh in
at 2.7 to 5.4 kilograms, domestic cats
can be found as pets in many homes or
hovering about storehouses, watching
for marauding rats and birds to eat.
While independent creatures, they do
entertain the company of humanoids
and do form a small number of strong
social bonds.
Related to the domestic cat are the
feline predators of the wild, known commonly as the great cats. These include
cheetahs, cougars, leopards, panthers,
lions, tigers, and others. Tigers are 75

•

Page 13

to 286 kilograms and measure 1.2 to 2.8
meters in length, while lions are 1.9 to
2.7 meters in length and weight between
112 and 270 kilograms. All prefer to go
after herd animals like deer, wildebeest,
and the like, but they will eat what is
available, including carrion, reptiles,
ﬁsh, and berries.
The primary hunting technique of
all cats, large or small, is to stalk their
prey and use the terrain to mask their
approach. They then pounce at their
intended meal from the side or rear,
knocking it to the ground and going
for the throat. The larger cats, like
cougars and lions, often pursue prey
that is much larger than they are, but
domestic cats rarely go after anything
near to their size. Once the prey has
been rendered helpless or dead, cats
generally take it to a secluded place to
eat. However, domestic cats that have
a good relationship with humanoids
often leave their kill (or at least a good
part of it) in a place for their upright
companion to ﬁnd. It is a practice that
is said to be part of some ancient ritual
to bless, or curse, the humanoid for their
treatment of the feline ... if one believes
in that sort of thing.

Celestial
Many religions feature divine messengers, beings from the heavens
who descend to warn — or punish
— humanity. Though some claim that
these creatures are mere hallucinations,
exaggerations, or metaphors, they are all
too real. Divine beings come in several
forms, but the most common are the
heaven-born winged creatures often
referred to as Celestials.
Celestials resemble Humans except
for three things. First, they are gloriously beautiful, with long, graceful
limbs, androgynous features, ﬂawless
skin, ﬂowing hair, and large, expressive
eyes. Second, Celestials have golden skin
and white-blonde or bronze-brown hair,
and eyes of such a pale blue or green
they appear almost white. They seem to
glow with health, vitality, and beauty.
Third, Celestials have large wings that
sprout from their shoulder blades. These
wings are fully functional, and allow the
Celestials to ﬂy at impressive speeds and
with astounding agility. Most Celestials
have four to eight wings, which seem to
overlap somehow, though some have
only a perfectly matched pair.
Celestials have a strict hierarchy,
which determines not only rank and
duties but even physical appearance. For

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

example, certain Celestials have only two
wings, while others have four, six, eight,
or even 10. Unfortunately, no Celestial
has ever conﬁrmed the proper hierarchy,
so two mortals (or even two religions) can
have wildly diﬀerent ideas of where one
Celestial stands in the divine order.
Celestials do not need to eat or
drink, or even to breathe. Their link to
the divine provides all the sustenance
they need, although both sunlight and
positive emotions can give them added
strength and comfort.
Most Celestials seem haughty to
mortals, because they command rather
than request, and because they dislike
being touched. This is not arrogance,
however. Celestials are accustomed to
absolutes, and have no concept of lies,
uncertainties, or tact. They speak their
mind, state what they know, and place
complete conﬁdence in whatever action
sounds best to them — but if a new
plan sounds better they will switch to
supporting that, and see no problem
with such a drastic reversal.

Centaur
Centaurs are an amalgam of horses
and Humans, possessing the upper torso
and arms of a man attached to the body,
legs, and tail of a horse. (Scholars are a
bit mystiﬁed that, at four equine and
two Human limbs, Centaurs have more
appendages than either source creature.) Centaurs have two distinct social
groups: territorial, which are composed
of mixed numbers of males and females
resembling nomadic human tribes; and
harems, consisting of one or two dominant males and ﬁve to six females in a
life-long dedicated grouping.
Centaurs are omnivorous, supplementing their gathered vegetative
diet with small game hunting. They
are regional but somewhat nomadic,
forgoing most permanent structures.
They prefer living in temperate forests,
brushlands, and mountainous terrain,
although can adapt in diﬃcult times to
reside in less hospitable areas.
Centaurs are usually mildly xenophobic, preferring the company of their own

•

Page 15

kind rather than those from the outside
world. These views are not entirely justiﬁed, as Centaurs have been captured in
the past by other unscrupulous races.
In combat with outsiders, Centaurs
prefer the bow and arrow, although they
sometimes use other weapons relying
mostly on upper-body skills, such as
the spear or net. Centaurs can also ﬁght
using hooves and ﬁsts, although such
methods are usually reserved for ritualistic battles among their own kind.
Centaurs are intelligent and cunning
but typically wild, unpredictable, and
prone to succumbing to alcoholic and
amorous desires. However, well-mannered Centaurs are possible, and bards
sing tales of those who have overcome
their more base nature. Although Centaurs are generally distrustful of nonCentaurs, those who form bonds with
outsiders will defend their friends to the
death. While it’s rude to think of a Centaur as a horse to domesticate, friendly
Centaurs may permit Humans to ride
them like horses (they generally prefer
riders of the opposite gender).

Cyclops
A race of seemingly contradictory
giants, Cyclopes (the plural of “Cyclops”)
trace their lineage directly from the gods.
Sages as a rule do not disagree with this
assertion, not because of overwhelming
evidence — proof remains sketchy, at
best — but rather because most scholars
have a policy against drawing the ire of
volatile man-eating giants.
Standing at eight to 10 meters,
Cyclopes appear for the most part to be
giant Humans. However, instead of two
eyes, they possess one large eye in the
center of their forehead. They traditionally dress in the loosely sewn skins of
large animals, and prefer weapons that
can best utilize their size and strength,
such as tree-trunk clubs and thrown
boulders. Curiously, Cyclopes have a
remarkable blacksmithing tradition,
despite the fact that they have little
use for metal objects or armaments
themselves; many legendary weapons
— oversized and Human alike — are
of Cyclopean origin.
These giants generally prefer solitary
existences, either roaming from place
to place or dwelling in caves and raising

Cyclopes is born a scholar, and parentage does not determine role. Cyclopean
society favors its warriors slightly, but
recognizes the value of its sages and
seers. Human sages debate whether any
intrinsic quality separates scholars from
warriors, or if the diﬀerence remains
rooted in culture and upbringing.
Cyclopes have interpersonal liaisons
as desired; they do not marry or form
other life commitments, although some
have a preferred mate. Fertility rates
fall slightly below Humans’, with a
six-month gestation period. Cyclopean
mothers, with separate help and care
from their fathers, protect and nurture
their children until deemed mature at 14
years old, at which point they become
full members of society. Cyclopes can
live to be 80, although most die decades
earlier due to their combative lives.

livestock such as sheep and cows. They
use animals to satisfy their carnivorous eating habits, but many Cyclopes
develop a taste for Human ﬂesh.
They can survive in most climes
except arctic or desert conditions. However, they prefer seaside mountainous
areas with lots of fresh water. Occasionally, they band together in clusters akin
to villages and hamlets, where members
assume diﬀerent occupations such as
tailor, blacksmith, or sage. Their chaotic
and explosive natures make any larger
social structures impossible, although
tales tell of one or two self-controlled
Cyclopes residing in large tolerant cities. Although they prefer their privacy,
Cyclopes are quick to band and defend
others of their kind from threats or acts
of aggression; only against extended
threats or wars will they appoint a warlord to serve as leader. Cyclopean society
treats males and females equally.
Cyclopes have two distinct subgroups
in their society: scholars and warriors.
For the most part, they are born into
their roles. Newborn Cyclopes who do
not open their eyes until six to eight
weeks are warriors, while scholars’ eyes
open upon birth. However, Cyclopes

Demon
Demons are interdimensional creatures from Hell sent to tempt mortals
into corrupting and selling their souls.
These creatures come in a variety of
shapes and sizes, and no two are alike.
Most are humanoid with Human facial
features, although the more fearsome
of the species have animal or insect
features. Demons have a tough hide
that is evident when in its true form.
Additionally, in its true form it has horns
and cloven feet and sometimes wings
and a tail. Demons generally shapeshift
into more pleasing forms.
In Hell, Demons have a social structure that mirrors that of the most popular current humanoid structure, minus
a few years. This structure is more of a
guide for the Demons. In reality, only
the strong rule and the weak serve.
Due to the precarious balance between
Good and Evil, Demons adhere to strict
rules when on Earth (lest they incur
the wrath of the Good). They cannot
injure a non-Demon unless they have
been attacked ﬁrst. They must fulﬁll any
promise that is made when someone
uses their true name. (Due to their evil
nature, they will do so only to the letter

Dinosaur
Tyrannosaurus
Rex
Measuring 15.25 meters from nose
to tail, standing over 5.5 meters tall,
weighing over ﬁve metric tons, and
sporting one-meter jaws that can bite
a horse in two, the tyrannosaurus rex
is the undisputed king of predators.
But there is much more to the life of
this famous hunter than many people
realize. These fast, agile, and intelligent
eating machines are just as likely to
be found playing games of tag with
other tyrannosaurs, chasing prey or
harassing other dangerous animals
for the sheer joy of it, mucking about
in ponds and mud holes, sliding down
snow-covered hillsides on their backs,
or even simply playing with string. They
enjoy challenging puzzles and will work
for hours trying to crack a barrel as if
hoping to ﬁnd a dozen cows magically
hidden inside.
Although capable of running down
and killing most animals for food,
tyrannosaurs never pass up a chance
to scavenge carcasses or dine on easier
prey. And few scholar-adventurers realize that the terrible lizard king is not
a true carnivore at all. One intrepid
professor witnessed three tyrannosaurs
devour something with great relish,
and then stumble crazily around afterwards as if drunk. The aﬄicted beasts
ignored members of the expedition
as they inched their way closer, only
to discover that the tyrants had been
feasting on a huge heap of berries that
had been fermenting in the sun. The
three lizard kings then brieﬂy charged
at the explorers but did not pursue them
as they ﬂed the scene. In this regard,
tyrannosaurs most resemble crows and
ravens — much like those ubiquitous
harbingers of fate, tyrannosaurs eat
just about anything and are known to
collect shiny things (as many unfortunate adventurers have discovered), but
whether as gifts for their mates, prizes to
line their nests, or simply as entertaining diversions, none can say.

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

Immature tyrannosaurs live in
crèches of two to seven individuals of
approximately the same age, though
not necessarily related by blood. The
social bond of the crèche lasts throughout a tyrant’s long, event-ﬁlled life
(tyrannosaurs live up to 125 years),
and individuals sometimes undertake
extended journeys years later to visit
old friends. However, as with all things,
even the closest bonds eventually give
way when members leave in search
of mating prospects. Tyrannosaurs
mate for life and show great aﬀection
through nuzzling and preening, and
some tyrants have even been known to
pine away upon the loss of a companion.
Intellect of this unexpectedly advanced
and touchingly familiar behavior may
oﬀer little comfort, however, if a triad
of adolescent lizard kings picks up a lost
adventurer’s scent...

The triceratops is a diﬃcult animal to

they are extremely dangerous when

velociraptors, or large mammalian
carnivores. A typical triceratops stands
over three meters tall and measures over

the patience, endurance, and skill of
these consummate hunters. Standing
nearly two meters tall, able to outrun a
thoroughbred at full sprint, and armed

strong grasping claws, they possess a
chameleon-like ability to change their
skin patterns and colors to match any
terrain, and an appetite that is never
sated. These creatures are the dire
wolves of their kind — nightmares
brought to life.
Velociraptor packs live in den-warrens scratched from hillsides or clay pits.
Their social hierarchy is a living model
of the principal of the survival of the
ﬁttest. ’Raptors run in packs of 12 or
more individuals ruled by a mated alpha
pair. Pack member positions ﬂuctuate
according to the individual’s current
health and strength. Injury or disease
often causes a pack member to slip down
a rung within ’raptor society, and those
that appear too weak risk ending up
on the menu. Velociraptors of beta or
lower status are free to choose mates,
and mated pairs help each other survive
injury and famine, but only an alpha will
risk its life to protect its mate.
Velociraptors hunt in groups called
jagers, instinctively employing hunting tactics that would challenge even
the best Elven trackers. Jagers are
composed of four individuals, usually
mated pairs, which operate around the
clock to meet the needs of demanding warm-blooded metabolisms. They
have been known to wander up to 48
kilometers a day to ﬁnd food in lean
times. In such cases, successful hunters
eat their ﬁll and drag the rest back to
the den-warren to share with the others. Alphas do not hunt in jagers, their
primary duties being to produce eggs,
raise the pack’s collective young, and
defend them from predators while the
jagers seek food.
While ’raptors do not normally stalk
healthy, uninjured targets that are much
larger than themselves, famine can force
jagers to override this important instinct.
This behavior usually leads to serious
injury or death, but scholarly expeditions
have watched desperate, starving jagers

Pterosaur
Of all the beasts that own the skies,
nothing stirs stronger primordial emotions than the sight of a lone pterosaur
gliding silently overhead on thin, leathery wings. Now, imagine the feeling when
a thousand pterosaurs suddenly wing

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

into sight in coordinated pursuit of ﬂying
prey. With a wingspan of 12 meters, large
intelligent eyes, an even larger brain,
and a one-meter beak full of small sharp
teeth, the pterosaur is matched in aerial
spectacle only by Dragons.
Easy gliders and powerful ﬂyers,
pterosaurs live in expansive social
rookeries comprised of hundreds or
sometimes thousands of mated pairs.
They prefer ocean-side cliﬀs, although
redwood trees overlooking large lakes
or inland seas serve just as well. Only
the fecundity of ﬁshes can satisfy the
needs of hungry hatchlings, but this
does not mean that a pterosaur will pass
up an easy meal. Adventurers traveling
along isolated seacoasts have lost their
captured boars, and even the occasional
donkey, to a ﬂight of keen-eyed pterosaurs on patrol.
Pterosaurs often hunt singly, skimming the surface of waves and scooping
up ﬁsh and other appropriately sized
tidbits, eating some and saving the rest
in pelican-like pouches to carry home
to feed the hatchlings. Sometimes,
though, pterosaurs hunt in groups called
ﬂights (or ﬂying circuses, if a species
bears particularly colorful markings).
Flights are naturally adept at distracting prey and making sneak attacks from

unexpected directions. The incentive
for hunting as part of a ﬂight is that all
members share the catch. Flights take
most land-bound animals by surprise,
gliding in silently and diving seemingly
right out of the sun. Pterosaurs must
succeed in snatching their prey in one
pass or risk being grounded, for they
are clumsy on land and few make it back
into the air without suﬀering injury, as
the occasional torn and broken leathery
corpse can attest.
In the air, however, the pterosaur is
master — nothing escapes the premier
maneuvering instincts of these lords of
the sky. It is for this reason that some
have thought to tame these magniﬁcent
beasts and use them as aerial mounts
to terrify enemies in combat. The truth
of the matter is that for all their size,
pterosaurs only weigh about 18 kilograms — the weight of a rider would
crush the pterosaur’s bones during the
furious maneuvering required during
aerial combat, leaving the poor beast
and its passenger plummeting helplessly to their deaths. The theory of
pterosaur/rider teams might work in
practice, but only if employed as messengers or aerial observers.

Djinn
Most legends state that the ﬁrst
Humans were created from earth. Some
of those legends further explain that
the same forces that produced Humans
also fashioned beings from the other
elements. The Djinn were one result
with two separate races, one composed
of ﬁre and the other of air.
The Djinn are masters of shapeshifting, with bodies as ﬂeeting as
the elements from which they were
spawned. Those tied to good tend to
be stunningly attractive, while those
aligned with evil are equally ugly. However, evil Djinn can assume more comely
appearances to better deceive others.
Regardless, their natural forms always
betray their element, either as a body
emerging from wispy clouds or a form
surrounded by ﬂaming tendrils.
Both types of Djinn have similar
abilities, although the means they use
to manifest them are wildly disparate.
Fire Djinn are typically creatures of
chaos and evil, while air Djinn are
usually devoted to harmony and good.
However, Djinn do have free will and can
theoretically serve any goal they would
like. Nonetheless, only a fool would
blindly trust a ﬁre Djinni that says it
wants “nothing but to help.”

Dog
Dogs are domesticated canines that
are found all over the world. They come
in a variety of colors, sizes, and shapes.
All dogs are four-legged; the vast majority have fur and a cold nose. The colors
of a dog’s coat ranges from white to
reddish-brown to yellow to black and
combinations of these colors.
Lap dogs tend to be small and
provide companionship for humans.
Hunting dogs are generally small to
medium-sized and are especially bred
for trailing big and small game. Guard
dogs are usually the largest and always
the most sturdy of dogs. These canines
are bred for battle and are sometimes
be equipped with specially designed
light armor.
All dogs follow the pack social structure. In the wild, the alpha male proves
his dominance in combat over the other
males. He becomes the leader of the pack
and all dogs within that pack follow him.
Domesticated canines follow the pack
mentality to a lesser extent. Because of
their close association with Humans,
their owners generally take the place
of the alpha male.
Canines can be found in almost any
climate, but certain breeds will be found
in certain climes. Wherever there are
humans there are always dogs to follow
them. Dogs are extremely loyal to their
masters, even masters that do not treat
them very well.
Dogs are carnivores and must be fed
regularly. Masters that forget to feed
their dogs will have a hard time controlling them, even if they treat them
well. Dogs have an amazing sense of
smell. They can smell a drop of blood in
a bucket of water. It is for this reason
that they make excellent hunters and
guards. Dogs often smell an opponent
before they see them.
These creatures dislike cats and other
feline-related creatures. Even the most
trained dog may let out a bark when he
catches a whiﬀ of cat. Some dogs are
extremely intelligent and capable of
complex tricks.

D6 Fantasy Creatures

Dragon
Few creatures are feared more than
the dragon and for good reason. Their
immense size, reptilian or serpentine
appearance, extreme age, active intelligence, and magical ability are more than
a match for whole armies, particularly
since most dragons can also ﬂy. Dragons
can be divided into six major types: earth,
air, ﬁre, water, skeleton, and oriental.

Air Dragon
Air Dragons are slight of build, long
and lean, and their wings are usually
feathered, as are the ends of their tails.
Their scales also resemble feathers, and
have a faint sheen to them. Most Air
Dragons are pale in color, particularly
blue, green, or gold and silver.
The Air Dragons are playful and
sociable. This may be because more Air
Dragons exist or because they wander so
much that claiming territory is impossible. Air Dragons often travel in small
packs, but happily mix with any other Air
Dragons they ﬁnd. Most Air Dragons care
about little other than ﬂying and socializing, and they exchange news, gossip,
and idle conversation readily. Many also
happily speak to birds and other airborne
creatures, and even those people brave
enough to approach them openly.
Within each pack, a single Air Dragon
holds sway. This only means that he or
she can tell the others when it is time
to move on and which direction they
should go — the position is akin to
that of a party host or a trip organizer.
This lead Air Dragon is usually a little
older and slightly less ﬂighty, but only
slightly, and packs are easily distracted.
Air Dragons simply go wherever the
wind and their own interests take them.
An Air Dragon may wander away from
his pack, if they are going one way and
he wants to go another, and then join a
new pack heading in that direction. Later,
if he encounters his ﬁrst pack again, he
might rejoin them, or simply visit with
them and catch up on recent events.
Air Dragons survive mainly on small
birds and on ﬁsh they pluck from the sea.
They enjoy the thrill of catching their
food but have no interest in causing

•

Page 23

terror — they simply love the chance to
show their speed and agility. Air Dragons rarely attack humanoids, though a
pack might wheel about a lone traveler
and dance around him, even feinting
at him with claws and jaws. Of course,
if attacked, the pack will defend itself,
but most Air Dragons have no love of
ﬁghting, only in ﬂying.
Despite their slighter build, Air Dragons do not mind the cold — indeed,
they often ﬂy high above the ground,
where the air is thinner and colder and
their breath streams behind them.
Air Dragon packs are often seen over
mountain peaks and flitting about
mountain ranges. They also enjoy wide
open expanses, like deserts or valleys,
where nothing slows the wind from
racing across the landscape.

Earth Dragon
Earth Dragons are typically the largest and heaviest of the species, with
thick bodies supported on four massive
clawed legs, and a long neck bearing the
large head. Enormous bat wings on their
backs enable them to ﬂy, and they can
use their heavy tails as weapons. Their
thick scales are typically the color of
rust, blood, or copper.
The entire Earth Dragon population is
small as they live for thousands of years,
but dragon mothers give birth to only
one egg at a time. Most centuries see the
birth of only a single dragon. Because
they are so few in number, each dragon
stakes out its own territory. Any other
dragon entering that territory must
acknowledge the owner’s supremacy
or ﬁght for possession. Thus Earth
Dragons meet rarely. Only in times
of overwhelming need do they gather
together, either in some place so barren no dragon claims it or in a location
owned by a dragon so powerful no other
dares to challenge him.
Even when Earth Dragons mate, they
are wary of surrendering control, and
their mating dances are performed in
the air, usually over some neutral territory. Earth Dragons have no leaders, but
the strongest dragons hold the choicest
locations and command respect from
their peers.
Earth Dragons are carnivores. They
hunt for their food and delight in ﬂying low to the ground, neck stretched
forward and mouth open, to scoop up
deer, cows, and humanoids in their
path. Earth Dragons often toy with their
prey, swooping down to land stunning
blows that bat their victims about and
herd them in a particular direction.
Earth Dragons are not known for their
subtlety, and enjoy the fear they sense
from their prey, and from anyone who
sees them approach. They consider

Page 24

anyone on their lands to be fair game,
and the most powerful Earth Dragons
have laid claim to whole cities, which
they allow to stand because the cities
attract more victims.
Earth Dragons enjoy living places
safe and warm, and select caverns for
their homes. Some of these lairs cut
into mountains or hills, while others
are below ground, particularly along
a coastline. The Earth Dragon often
hollows the space out further, smoothing the walls and giving himself more
room to maneuver. Of course, Earth
Dragons favor existing underground
tunnels, whether or not they currently
have residents.
Earth Dragons usually live in temperate regions, because their prey prefers
these areas and because they do not
enjoy the cold. Most Earth Dragons
have at least a small town or two within
their territory, and forests, meadows, or
farmlands are also common.

Fire Dragon
Fire Dragons are the smallest variety
of dragon. They are winged but have only
front legs — their back section simply
curls into a long tail with a spade end.
Their scales are shades of red, orange,
yellow, and gold.
Some sages believe that Fire Dragons
are not real dragons at all, only creatures
with a similar appearance because it
doesn’t exhibit the same intelligence
or size as others of this species. Fire
Dragons are tiny and fast and appear
alone or in twos or threes. They are
drawn to ﬁre, and they often appear
near any large blaze — even a good-sized
campﬁre can call one, though the ﬂame
must be outdoors or near the opening of

D6 Fantasy Creatures
a a natural shelter like a cave. When a
Fire Dragon does appear, it ignores any
nearby creatures and ﬂies straight to
the ﬂame — and into it. Then it swoops
around, enjoying the heat and the light,
teasing the ﬁre into taller ﬂames and
often creating small trailers that spin
oﬀ from the original blaze. They delight
in its movement and warmth, and care
little for its eﬀect on others. They only
enlarge and sustain a ﬁre so that they
can enjoy the ﬂames for a longer period
of time.
Fire Dragons have no real social
structure. Each dragon or group keeps
to itself and travels within its chosen
area (which may be small if there’s a
large concentration of ﬁres), seeking
ﬂames. The ﬁrst Fire Dragon or group
there takes possession of that particular
ﬁre. Any other Fire Dragons in the area
will not disturb them, and Fire Dragons
never ﬁght for possession. They also
have no voice, which is another reason
why scholars claim they are not real
dragons at all.
Fire Dragons are not vicious, but they
will attack anyone who gets too close
to them while they are within a ﬂame.
They will also ﬁght anyone trying to put
out the ﬁre.
Fire Dragons only like meat that
has been severely charred. They are
so small they do not need much food.
They often survive on those scraps
left in campﬁres by travelers, or small
woodlands creatures caught and cooked
in forest blazes.
Fire Dragons prefer heavily wooded
areas and dry plains, since both have
opportunities for frequent ﬁres. When
not dancing within a ﬂame, they nest
within hollowed-out trees at night.
By day, they curl up on ﬂat rocks and
bask in the sunlight, the same way that
snakes do.

Water Dragon
Water Dragons have four small legs
and no wings. They are long and narrow, to allow them to slide through the
water. Long ridges, which resemble ﬁsh
ﬁns but feel more like scales, run down
their back and trail from each clawed
foot. Older Water Dragons have similar
ridges trailing from their brows. Their
scales are slick and range in color from
pale green to a vivid dark blue.
Most Water Dragons live alone or in
mated pairs, but they often gather with
their kin to discuss events and enjoy
one another’s company. Water Dragons
group themselves by family, and each
family has a matriarch, a patriarch, or
both. The extended family lives within a
small sea, sizable lake, or large portion
of the ocean. Each family member or
couple claims a region for personal use.
Most families gather at least once each

month, typically in the domain belonging to the head of the family. Water
Dragons from other families must ask
permission when entering the family’s
territory, or they are treated as invaders and attacked. Neighboring families
gather together two to three times a year
to discuss larger issues and to maintain
friendly relations. Water Dragons from
different households often become
friends and, if their regions border one
another, meet more frequently.
Water Dragons are talkative when
with their own family, but their topics
are serious and subjects can hold their
attention for hours. They enjoy gossiping about neighbors, but they also
discuss philosophy, marine biology, and
other weight issues.
Fish are the main food for Water
Dragons, followed by all manner of sea
creatures. Any animals that wander into
a Water Dragon’s territory become fair
game, including humanoids. Though
they are not violently malicious, Water
Dragons do enjoy taunting surfacedwellers. They also consider it an insult
for a surface-dweller to cross over their
home without asking permission and
so often capsize boats. Those ﬁsherfolk who oﬀer gifts to the dragons ﬁnd
smooth waters and plentiful ﬁshing,
though sometimes a young Water
Dragon rocks their boat just for fun. Any
humanoid who dares to attack a Water
Dragon will be pursued by the entire
family, and if she manages to escape to
land she will ﬁnd them waiting every
time she ventures near water again.
Water Dragons make their homes
among nests of coral and seaweed, along
the ocean or lake ﬂoor. They favor deeper
waters, where they can sleep undisturbed
and unseen. Over time, the dragons
often carve upon the coral, transforming
it into a rooﬂess palace with delicately
ﬂuted columns everywhere.

Oriental Dragon
Oriental Dragons are long and sinewy. They have horns on their brows
and long wispy beards on their chins.
The ridges on their backs and tails are
long. They have no wings but four legs,
each ending in an agile claw — most
Oriental Dragons have four claws per
foot, but the Imperial dragon has ﬁve.
Their scales shimmer and range in color
from black to blue to red to gold, silver,
or even white.
Oriental Dragons are the most intelligent of the dragons, and they can sit for
months or even years while pondering
some topic. Oriental Dragons enjoy a
good debate or an intellectual discussion. They are sparing with their words,
however, and often speak in vague terms
and near-riddles.
Most of the Oriental Dragons — and
they are the rarest of the dragon races

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

— live alone and see other dragons only
rarely. They interact with humanoids
more frequently, liking to disguise
themselves as such to wander the
countryside.
Oriental Dragons are not violent,
though they will defend themselves
when attacked. They do enjoy confrontation but prefer battles of a more intellectual nature. They enjoy creating moral
quandaries for humanoids in order to
watch their reactions.
They will only attack humanoids for
three reasons: the people attack ﬁrst, the
people threaten the dragon’s interests
or domain, or the people have demonstrated themselves to be villains (usually
by harming someone the dragon considers a worthy individual). In those situations, the Oriental Dragon is a deadly
opponent, clever as well as strong.
Because there are so few of them,
what most people assume to be racial
subtypes are actually speciﬁc dragons.
The Yellow Dragon and the Horned
Dragon, for example, are individual
dragons rather than types. Only the Yellow Dragon is covered with bright yellow
scales, and only the Horned Dragon has
four horns above his brows and a ridge
of them running down his snout to the
tip of his nose.
The leader of the Oriental Dragons
is the Imperial Dragon (also known as
the Celestial Dragon), who has jet-black
scales and ﬁve claws on each foot. This
dragon is the wisest and most powerful
of the Oriental Dragons, and he may
command any of the others, though
he rarely does so. He does, however,
wander into another dragon’s domain
with impunity — the other Oriental
Dragons must ask permission before
entering another’s domain, or face a
challenge (usually to either a logic puzzle
or a verbal duel).
Unlike the other dragon races, the
Oriental Dragons are vegetarians.
They eat mainly bamboo shoots and
rice, though they happily consume
any fruits they can ﬁnd. They will also
eat bread and vegetables. No Oriental
Dragon will deliberately eat meat, and
it is a grave insult to oﬀer meat to one
of them. They also drink rice wine, and

anyone who oﬀers a dragon this drink
wins their favor.
Each Oriental Dragon has his own
interests and his own domain. Some
settle in lake beds, others atop mountains, and still others deep in forests
or hidden valleys. Certain dragons
consider it their duty to guard treasures,
whether natural or crafted, while others
train people, travel the world, or make
sure the seasons occur without fail.

Skeleton Dragon
Skeleton Dragons are usually taken
from the Earth Dragons, and so have
massive frames and skeletal wings.
Unlike the other ﬁve types, Skeleton
Dragons are not natural creatures,
and are created rather than born.
They are typically fashioned by
necromancers, who reassemble
a dead dragon’s bones and then
reanimate the skeleton to create
a massive, magical servant. Fortunately, Skeleton Dragons lack
most of their former intelligence,
and only a handful is capable of
magic. Most Skeleton Dragons
have only their size, their strength,
their ﬂight, and the fact that they are
undead and so are immune to many
mundane weapons.
Skeleton Dragons have no society and
thus no hierarchy. Each of these creatures has been animated by a particular
individual. It is enthralled to that person
and required to do her bidding. Only
when two or more Skeleton Dragons
serve the same master do they ﬁght for
control, with the strongest becoming
the leader of their small pack and commanding the other members.
Skeleton Dragons are not alive and
thus do not need to eat, drink, sleep, or
breathe. They are tireless and can ﬂy or
ﬁght for hours without pause.
Because they are no longer truly alive,
and never can be again, Skeleton Dragons
hate the living. They particularly loathe
living reptiles and, above all else, living
dragons. A Skeleton Dragon will attack a
living dragon at every opportunity.
Skeleton Dragons can be found anywhere in the world, as they go wherever
their master goes or wherever she orders

them to go. They are most common in
the countryside, however, where people
are less likely to have defenses against
magic and thus where a dragon of any
sort has the greatest impact.

Dwarf
Dwarves are built like short, stout
Humans. They stand about 1.5 meters
and usually have broad features and
thick beards. Most people are familiar
with the Mountain Dwarves (or Mynyd),
but three other types exist: the Dwende,
the Chanak, and the Wavelorn.

Dwende
The Dwende surface-dwelling dwarves
who live in tropical regions. Their skin
is deeply tanned from the sun. They
wear only simple kilts and sometimes
loose shirts, and either go barefoot or
wear sandals.
Dwende live in small tribes or clans,
each lead by a chieftain. This chieftain
decides on all matters of importance,
including hunting, marriage, and tribal
location. Once chosen, a chieftain
retains control until he dies, steps down
because of age, or is forcibly removed by
a majority of the clan. Larger tribes also
have a council of elders, and each tribe
has a medicine man who regulates the
tribe’s herbs, potions, and healing.
The Dwende hunt small game both
on land and along the water’s edge.
They also grow fruits, vegetables, grains,
particularly grapes and barley — the
Dwende share their underground cousins’ love for wine and ale.
Though not unfriendly, the Dwende
are reclusive — their villages are made
of local materials and well hidden among
trees or within low dunes, and people
can walk within a meter of a Dwende
house without seeing it. Nevertheless,
the Dwende treat guests superbly,
particularly when they can get news
and stories about distant lands. The
Dwende place great value in hospitality,
honesty, and loyalty — the worst crime
they can imagine is to turn away friends
and family in a time of need.

Mynyd
The most widely known and
most numerous race of Dwarves,
the Mynyd (or Mountain Dwarves)
consider themselves the progenitors
of all other Dwarven races. They are
skilled metallu rgists, engine ers,
and miners. A few even have some
magical gifts.
The Mynyd favor dark, study
clothing and long hair, which both
males and females wear in braids.
Dwarv en men also prefer long
beards, to keep their faces warm
in the cool underground tunnels.
They are terse in speech and gruﬀ in
manner, possibly owing a constant
need to be on the defensive against
raids on their treasure. (Elves say
it’s because they don’t get enough
sunlight and fresh air.) Once their
trust has been gained, most ﬁnd
them to be generous hosts.
They live in city-kingdoms, each
claiming a small mountain range or
portion of a large range, wherever
precious or useful metals and stones
abound.
Though they hunt small game,
gather tunnel mushr ooms and
lichen, and plant vegetable and
fruit gardens near the entrances to
their dwellings, they have become
so renowned for their jewels and
metalsmithing that they find it
more eﬃcient and lucrative to trade
for their foodstuﬀs. Nonetheless,
though they don’t grow much of
their own grain, they do brew their
own strong ale.

Chanak
The Chanak are nocturnal surfacedwellers with pale skin and scraggly
beards. They are lean and have long, thin
ﬁngers. They prefer to hide themselves
in thick cloaks with deep hoods.
The Chanak move among the larger
folk frequently but want nothing to do
with them. The Chanak consider humanoids as only useful for their money, their
goods, and sometimes for the look on
their faces when they know they have
been robbed or cheated.
Chanak gather in small tribes or
clans, often secretly locating their villages near Human cities. A tribal chief
leads the settlement, though anyone
can challenge him at any time, and the
winner becomes (or remains) the chief.
Chanak chiefs hold absolute power over
the tribe, in large part because they have
defeated anyone who might question
their decisions.
The Chanak prefer stealing their food
to hunting for it. They also buy food,
using the money and goods they stole.
They rarely drink alcohol, however, as
they do not trust anyone to protect them
when they are drunk.

Wavelorn
The Wavelorn are aquatic Dwarves.
They have a blue-green tint to their
skin and hair, and webbing between
their ﬁngers and toes. Gills are visible
along their necks, and they wear very
little because clothing slows them in
the water.
The Wavelorn live in small tribes. Each
tribe selects a tribal leader, or headman,
who then takes total command — the
headman is chosen after several tests.
When the headman grows too tired
or too inﬁrm to lead, or when enough
elders vote that he should be replaced,
contests, which include a mock combat
and a race, are held and everyone who
wants the position enters. The elders
review each contestant’s abilities before
making their selection as a group.
The Wavelorn survive on a diet of
sea plants, ﬁsh, eels, and other sea
creatures. The Wavelorn often trade
shells or treasure
they found below
for other items or
services.

Giant Eel
Giant eels are larger cousins of their
more mundane kin. However, while
many Humans regard normal-sized
eels as a tasty delicacy, giant eels tend
to view Humans much the same. Exasperated naturalists note that the term
“giant eel” actually encompasses a
variety of diﬀerent species, both fresh
and saltwater. However, they all share
similar characteristics, especially in
their ferocity against those who invade
their territory.
With a snakelike body at least as thick
as a Human’s thigh and a length of ﬁve
meters or more, a single giant eel is more
than a match for most lone swimmers.
They come in a variety of shades and
markings; some are solid-colored with
only slight or no demarcation, while others have symmetric patterns running
down their bodies. Most giant eels have
skin that matches their surrounding
watery environment, providing excellent camouﬂage. Legends tell of one

giant eel that can change its coloration
and markings to hide near-perfectly.
Giant eels can live in any non-arctic
environment, although they are most
commonly found in temperate or
warmer regions. When it comes time
to spawn, most breeds of giant eels
instinctively return to a particular
breeding ground (which vary among
subspecies, and can be hundreds of
miles away), where the female releases
millions of eggs before she dies. Those
eggs follow the water currents and
transport the next generation of eels
far and wide. Some wealthy gourmets
savor these eggs and hire brave explorers
to track down these breeding spots for
egg-harvesting. Given how these areas
can contain dozens or even hundreds
of frisky eels eager to protect their
oﬀspring, any such mission can be as
dangerous as it is lucrative. Fresh water
giant eels are generally a little quicker
but less tough than their saltwater relatives, which can grow much larger than
their lake- and river-bound kin.

Giant eels, like their smaller brethren, are largely solitary predators.
They subsist entirely on meat, usually
in the form of large ﬁsh, and spend
their dormancy cycles sheltered in
coral reefs or caves. Most giant eels
swallow smaller prey whole or bite it
to death, but they can also constrict
larger victims (such as most Humans),
simultaneously inﬂicting damage and
keeping the quarry from escaping or
attacking. Giant eels do not generally
attack unprovoked, although their ﬁerce
territorialism means “provocation” can
include Human activities such as crossing a river in a boat or swimming along
the coast. They can survive out of water
for several minutes while continuing to
attack, and are smart enough to slither
back to the water if they can. It is rare
for them to attack something on land
without warning, although the traditional minstrel ditty “Ask Wee Willy
Why He Doesn’t Wee Water in the River
by the Wayfall Sea Anymore” oﬀers a
cautionary tale otherwise.

Elemental
Elementals are spirits made of one of
the raw magical elements of creation.
Elementals are only naturally found
in areas that have a high concentration
of the purest form of their element.
Summoned elementals are often bound
by wizards as pets, slaves, and warriors.
Summoned elementals will obey the letter of a summoner’s commands, but the
more clever elementals look for ways to
violate the spirit of the agreement.

Air Elemental
Air elementals normally take the form
of nearly invisible waves or currents of
air, only seen because the air shimmers
with their movement. They are not particularly strong, though they are fast and
diﬃcult to hit. They attack by pushing
and striking with masses of air.

Elephant
Elephants are typically native to
savannah and jungle regions, though
due to their popularity with humanoids
as beasts of burden, performers, and
engines of warfare, they can be found
anywhere that vegetation, water, and
people are plentiful. These creatures
can stand between 2.4 and 3.4 meters
at the should and weigh between 2.7
to 6.3 metric tons, rendering them a
formidable sight to any formation of
disciplined defenders. When angered,
or trained to, an elephant will charge
with devastating results to the terrain
and obstacles in its path, giving rise to
its appellation “the unstoppable force
of the wild.”
A war elephant is often rigged with a
small tower or similar fortiﬁed structure
upon its back. Depending on the size
of the animal, this allows two to six
soldiers to ride the creature into battle.
When used for carrying supplies or

•

Page 33

cargo, an elephant can generally move
half its own weight for great distances.
Despite this beneﬁt, people don’t often
use them for caravans unless food and
water is plentiful on the journey as an
elephant can eat up to 230 kilograms
of vegetation and 300 liters of water a
day, making them diﬃcult to care for
on long journeys.
In the wild, elephants travel in herds
of ﬁve to 20, with a large bull as the
leader. While considered the gentle
giant of the animal kingdom, the bulls
will attack any perceived threat, though
the amount of provocation required to
enrage an elephant is quite unpredictable. Many times bulls ignore interlopers who are not threatening a herd
member, simply staying alert while they
are present, but occasionally the males
attack without warning.
Elephants are intelligent creatures.
Compared to most creatures of the wild,
they are easy to train if they are started
young, at about four years of age. Aside

from instructing them to perform in
traveling shows or for the amusement
of kings, an elephant can be taught to
do a number of heavy labor activities
aside from simply carrying a load. Some
cultures use them to lift lumber with
their mighty trunks or demolish trees
and light structures. With an experienced teamster, elephants can also pull
wagons of enormous size, increasing
their capacity to move cargo by double
or more their normal ability.
Their lifespan and maturity rate is
very close to that of humanoids, reaching adulthood at around 15 to 20 years
old and living to about 70 years old or
more. They also show very distinct emotions, such as grieving at the side of a
lost herd member, showering friends
with aﬀection, and laughing. When
traveling with a band of adventurers,
they add color to any journey.

Elf
Elves were once thought to dwell
only in temperate forests, but travelers
have encountered Elven pilgrims in climates ranging from unbearable, steamy
jungles to frigid wastes. Perhaps this is
because Humans began settling these
areas only recently, at least as Elves
measure it (after all, what is 500 years
to a race of near immortals?).
Human scholars divide Elves into a
few species, but their physical diﬀerences are mostly cosmetic. Elves diﬀer
primarily in behavior and allegiance,
and most are inclined to remain aloof
from other sentient races. The High
Elves, called Fair Folk by some, are the
type of Elf most often encountered.
High Elves are intelligent and practical, enjoy games of skill, and possess
great wisdom gained from centuries
of contemplation. In appearance they
closely resemble Humans, though they
are healthier, sturdier, and far more
handsome. Tales of their graceful features, startling green or blue-gray eyes,
and clear, musical voices have led young
women and men into the wilderness in
the hopes of catching a glimpse of these
rare travelers.

HighElves

race is noble,
proud and
possessed of
the blood of
ancient rulers. Their
religious convictions run
deep, but their
elaborate ceremonies dedicated to the
gods of Nature
and Thought
are always concealed from the
eyes of outsiders.
When peace
blankets the
land, High Elves
spend their days in leisurely pursuit of
academic and philosophical goals, and
they carefully tend to the lands that
surround their chosen homes. In times
of war, however, High Elves are quick to
mobilize and ﬁerce in battle. Few armies
have ever stood against the assembled
hosts of the Fair Folk.
Black Elves take their name from
their jet-black skin, eyes, and hair. All
live underground, far from the light of
the sun that reminds them of an ancient
betrayal linked to the High Elves, whom
they regard with contempt. This hatred
for their cousins does not extend to other
races, though, and Black Elf outposts
have been known to trade with Dwarves,
Humans, and even more barbaric races
on occasion.
Black Elf society is organized along
military lines. Every 10 years (or as
needed), soldier-citizens elect a king
who wields absolute authority over an
expansive hierarchy of captains, lieutenants, sergeants, troops, specialists,
and non-combatant citizens (those that
are too old, too young, or too injured
to ﬁght). Kings reign 10 years if death
does not claim them ﬁrst (Black Elf
commanders lead from the fore in battle,

but surprisingly, most live to serve out
their terms).
Having waged ceaseless war against
a subterranean enemy (too terrifying
to describe) for millennia, Black Elves
have dispensed with religious pomp and
ceremony. The gods of the Black Elves
ask only that worshipers serve their
king and people. Since most Black Elves
spend a portion of every day engaged in
war-related eﬀorts, soldier-citizens prefer subdued, practical clothing or darkenameled armor to the colorful, ﬂowing
robes worn by other Elven societies.

Empusa
The Empusai (plural of Empusa) are
the demonic, vampiric daughters of evil
goddesses of magic. They are created
from the spirits of loyal priestesses. They
appear as beautiful women, but in their
true form, they have the upper bodies
of ﬁlthy, hideous women with pale skin
and the lower body of a donkey. Empusai
are always female.
Empusai social structures are based
on witch’s coven. At the head is a queen
and below her three sisters; below each
sister, three more; and so on. The Empusai above must approve of the behavior
of the Empusai below.
When hunting, the Empusai hunt
alone. In rare instances, groups of three
work together to capture a group of victims or a particularly powerful victim.
During the day, the Empusai disappear
into the underworld or hide in deep parts
of their temples, where they assume
their true demonic form. At night, they
hunt, seducing men and devouring them
when possible. The Empusai can only
exist on the ﬂesh of the living. They can
go an indeﬁnite period without feeding,
but failure to capture a victim for a long
period may mean a lowering of rank
within their coven.
The Empusai have a variety of magic
powers granted by their goddess. They
brew potions with adeptness, one of
their favorites being to change shape

Fairy
Fairies are spirits of Nature given
physical form and one purpose — to
serve Nature and protect its own. Their
presence is considered a reliable indicator of the health of the environment, for
a land without Fairies is one without
magic, cheer, or hope. As servants of
Nature, Fairies can speak with trees,
ferns, toadstools, mosses, every kind
of animal, and even some kinds of
rocks (other kinds of rocks refuse to
speak, don’t have anything to say, or
are just plain boring). Fairies trust the
High Elves implicitly, but distrust other
races, especially Humans and others
that disregard their eﬀects on nature,
leading some to speculate that they are
somehow related to the near-immortal
Fair Folk. Fairies know that all things
are related; most races just refuse to
accept the truth.
Being less than ﬁve centimeters tall,
Fairies could live right under the Big
Peoples’ noses without detection, but
instead prefer verdant landscapes bursting with scented ﬂowers, mosses, lily

ponds, oak trees, and toadstools. They
shun living among certain races of the
Big People, for Humans like to make pets
of cats, which are dangerous to even the
most cautious Fairy. In fact, almost any
animal, whether pet, livestock, or feral,
associated with the mannish-races are
dangerous to Fairies just from sheer
size alone. Fairies do not fear insects,
frogs, or mice, however, and have much
to oﬀer these creatures in exchange
for friendship and aid. For example,
these diminutive but cheerful beings
help mice gather enough food to last
through long and lean winter nights, and
in return mice warn Fairies whenever
cats are prowling nearby.
Two of the most common varieties
of Fairy-folk are Green Folk and Glade
Fairies.

Green Folk
Green Folk (sometimes called Green
Children by patronizing Humans) have
blonde, red, or light brown hair; green
or blue eyes; and child-like physiques
that belie their true strength, for Fairies
can lift over 20 times their own weight,

hefting a total of about two kilograms.
All Green Folk can ﬂy, even though
some appear to have no visible wings,
while the wings of others look like
the wings of insects or butterﬂies or
tatters of colors. They can also appear
two meters tall if needed, but this
glamour has no real eﬀect upon the
world, other than perhaps to ward
oﬀ would-be aggressors.
Green Folk enjoy the passing of
the seasons, spring and autumn
being their favorites, and consider
this when seeking a new place to
live.
Green Folk follow one of two
types of lifestyles, in community
or in solitude, though they are
united in purpose. Fairies living
in communities, are friendlier and
more numerous, residing in townships, called troupes, of 50 or more
individuals ruled over by a tough
but fair queen. Each queen in turn
serves Oberon and Titania, the
King and Queen of the Fairies,
powerful and enigmatic beings that
can pass as any humanoid species and
defeat all in combat or contest.
Each troupe arrays itself in distinguishable garments, often of the same
style or color. For example, the Shefro
dress mostly in green — forest green
jerkins, grass green tights, and leaf green
boots, but with pointed red caps. Males
wear one white feather in their cap to
signal love for a sweetheart.
The other type of Green Folk, the
solitary ones, are less populous by far
and they prefer the lives of introspective wanderers, making what they need
or trading for needed goods with other
Fairies. Loners and wanderers, many
dress in ﬂowing red medieval gowns or
scarlet doublets and pants and blood-red
capes, though prefer plainer clothes.
Of these solitary Fairies, the Ferrishin
alone know the secret of fashioning rope
woven from spiderwebs and dew-drop
gemstones, a combination that creates
a line of unusual strength and beauty,
one that they trade for items they cannot
make themselves. The solitary Fairies are
ruled by whoever draws the short straw
during their yearly gatherings. This form

the time to look for a very tiny ball of spider silk or a

Glade Fairies
A close relative of the Green Folk,
the Glade Fairy is equally hard to spot,
though for diﬀerent reasons (in their
defense, Glade Fairies have a saying:
“If you have to try very hard to ﬁnd
something, you’ve probably already
overlooked it”).
The only way to spot a Glade Fairy is to
sit quietly in a clearing at dawn or dusk,
thinking pleasant thoughts. Patient
observers might soon notice something
stirring where nothing moved before
(as grandmothers used to say, it always
was there; you just never took the time
to look). To those who remain calm and
quiet, some of the plants, or at least
beings that strongly resemble plants,
may come to life before their eyes. Glade
Fairies are perhaps the most striking of
all Fairy-kind, having willowy, mosscovered bodies, long, supple limbs, and
faces wrinkled and gnarled as the bark
of trees. They make their homes in the
transitional spaces between forests
and ﬁelds. They are especially fond of
deer, owls, pheasants, hedge gophers,
and damselﬂies, creatures that share

their habitat. When natural disasters
threaten, Glade Fairies work tirelessly
to rescue earth-bound animals from
oblivion. However, Glade Fairies are
helpless in the face of unnatural destruction (such as slash-and-burn practices)
wrought by sentient races, and do not
easily forgive such injuries. Many wouldbe farmers or ranchers have woken
up one morning to ﬁnd themselves
surrounded by poisonous scorpions,
venomous snakes, or worse.

Familiar
Familiars are magically enhanced versions of mundane animals. Wizards use
them as guardian, messenger, clairvoyant aide and companions, though they
still are prone to some mischievous or
not entirely intelligent behavior.
The process of making a familiar is
straightforward though challenging and
varies based on the mage and the magical power involved. The caster imbues
the target animal with a magical power
source based on their arcane preference
and then bonds with the creature.
The host animal can be any creature
that is nonmagical by nature and can
be carried by the master. A host gains
a number of abilities once the transformation is complete. Commonly, they
become stronger and quicker than their
mundane brethren, and they always
have a measure of magic resistance to
protect themselves from detection and
attack by enchanted means. In addition,
they quickly learn to understand, but
not speak, the language of their master. This allows them to follow fairly
complicated instructions and to spy
more eﬀectively by eavesdropping on
the conversations of intruders.
Many mages will also imbue their
familiars with a limited number of magical abilities, to facilitate their missions.
These abilities are simulated by skills the
animal could not normally posses, such
as being able to open doors or write. The

•

familiar can learn many intellectual skills,
such as new languages, over time.
As well as gaining an ally for spying,
companionship, and security, the master receives a number of abilities, which
depend on the type of familiar.

have established regular trade with the
Fiana, who produce ﬁnely crafted bronze
jewelry and beautifully carved wood and
bone items, but the islanders admire the
well-made leather boots of outsiders and
covet weapons of metal.
The Fiana keep to themselves most
of the time, and their territories are
inhospitable enough that few disturb
them. The few times nobles have tried
exploring Fiana lands with an eye toward
settling them, the Fiana have slaughtered
their men and proven that the cost was
far too high for such rocky terrain.

Typical Fianna

Fiana
Those who travel the islands of the
northern seas claim that not all the
islanders are exactly Human. The worst,
they say, are the Fiana, a race of people
who live in the mountains and hills of
some of the largest islands. The Fiana
look Human, but they can do things no
normal man or woman ever could. The
Fiana themselves claim this stems from
their descent from the supernaturally
endowed children of a powerful goddess,
who watches over their island homes.
The Fiana can be identiﬁed by the
blue tattoos that decorate their faces,
arms, and chests. Most Fiana carry only
weapons of bone, horn, wood, and stone,
though a few have blades of bronze. Their
simple and sturdy clothing is mostly
leather, though they wear fur capes in
winter. Fiana men have thick beards;
both men and women wear their hair
long and pulled back. They equally favor
thick bronze or gold necklaces, called
torcs, and both rings and earrings.
The Fiana divide themselves into
clans, each of which has its own distinctive name, tattooing style, leader, and
skald (a bard who keeps their history
as oral song). The clans are small, and
often work together to repulse invaders,
but each clan has its own territory, and

Flying Cat
The Flying Cat, or Winged Cat, is one
of many examples of creatures that have
spawned from the fall-out of mystical
practices. Domestic cats, as familiars,
are a great asset to mages, but unlike
other popular familiars, such as the
owl, they have diﬃculty traveling great
distances. Therefore, hundreds of practitioners of magic have strived to correct
that shortcoming by enhancing their
familiars through spell, potion, and,
on occasion, grafting “donated” wings.
Over the centuries, this has produced
an entirely new species of cat with
wings and the ability to ﬂy, albeit for
short distances much, to the chagrin
of mages everywhere.
These kin to the cat and the familiar
have beneﬁted greatly from the speedy
arcane evolution that has befallen
them. They are larger than either of
their cousins and weigh about nine to
14 kilograms full gown. They measure
up to a meter in body length, though
typically around three-quarters of a
meter, and have a wingspan of about
1.8 meters. It is certain that their ability
to ﬂy is magically enhanced, else they
would struggle simply gliding, much
less gaining altitude.

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

Flying Cats exhibit exceptional intelligent for what most consider to be an
animal. If some manner of translation
magic is available, they can engage in
complex conversations. In fact, they
have become so bright that they largely
no longer serve mages. If they do associate with a practitioner, it is generally
for equal gain. Only the most lazy of
Flying Cats work for simple room and
board. More often, they prefer to roam
and explore, avoiding long-term attachments outside of a mate and kittens.
These courtships and rearing of oﬀspring only last as long as it does for their
lesser cousins, and then the Winged Cat
moves on to new adventures.
Some Flying Cats like to “adopt” illfated travelers, others ally with adventurers for a common cause, while a few
are quite miscreant and play terrible
(even lethal) tricks on passers-by. The
disposition of the Flying Cat is generally
based on its experiences and varies as
much as it does in humanoids. Those
mistreated are either timid or cruel, but
when nurtured, they can be quite paternal. Unfortunately, the product of a few
evil spell casters has created a handful
of malicious Flying Cats, which have
been known to mastermind diabolical
plots of their own.

In appearance, the Flying Cat comes
in as many varieties as there are wild
and domestic cats. The wings sometimes
match the coat, but often they look
like the wings of a bird or other ﬂying
creatures including bats, butterﬂies,
and miniature dragons. Color and wing
type does not have any correlation to
personality, motivation, or abilities.

The Furies
The Furies are three hags — Alecto,
Tisiphone, and Megaera — who torment
the guilty. each appear to have the head
of a dog, hair made from snakes, wings
like bats, and the body of a human
woman. Each Fury carries a torch and
a whip, and they always appear angry.
They wear tattered garments.
The three hags argue constantly.
Alecto, being the oldest, is leader by
default, but the other two complain bitterly about her leadership. If a victim is
tormented by all three sisters, his best
bet is to pit the hags against one another
and then ﬂee in the ensuing melee.
The Furies have some magical abilities that they use to further torment
their victims, frighten them, and trick
them into dying horribly. Ideally, the
hags want the victim to die in an ironic
fashion connected to her guilt.
Although the Furies can eat, they do
not need to do so. They neither need to
breathe or sleep. The Furies cannot be
killed as long as sin exists (that is to say,
so long as people do mental or physical

proceed to engage any perceived threat

Ghost Warriors appear as they did in

expression of fury. They are impossible
to reason with, understanding nothing

meters and have wingspans of three
to ﬁve meters. Their hands are clawed,
their heads have horns and mouths full
of sharp teeth, and their bat-like wings
give them the power of ﬂight.
Gargoyles prefer surprise and ambush
to a fair duel. They tend
to choose one target
from a group, usually
the weakest of the lot,
and attack her until she
is slain. The only exception to this is when
someone is attempting
to damage their lairs
or use it for any type
of religious ceremony
— this causes the gargoyles to attack as one.
Gargoyles will attempt

Ghoul
An evil spirit inhabiting a corpse with
the distasteful habit of devouring both
the dead and living, scholars note that
Ghouls favor the ﬂesh of children. Living in graveyards and deserted places,
especially deserts, ghouls employ a
variety of tricks such as lighting ﬁres to
lure weary travelers, disguising themselves, and altering their size and shape.
Ghouls reportedly change into hyenas
or wolves, or shrink and use feral hares
and dogs as mounts to stalk prey.
Each ghoul has a unique appearance,
neither man nor brute, although many
survivors say ghouls prefer to use the
corpses of women. Many ghouls can
take on humanoid forms, such as a
well-known member of a community
(who can face lynching by paranoid
neighbors). However, the ghoul is always
detectable by its tracks — those of a
donkey. Sometimes, when horror is its
primary goal, a ghoul sprouts numerous

•

Page 43

heads and arms (of consumed victims)
with which to grab prey.
Use of a banish invocation (see pages
110–111 of the D6 Fantasy Rulebook) or
the presence of a holy person and holy
symbol can disrupt the ghoul’s powers
or cause it to ﬂee. Killing a ghoul is difﬁcult but possible with force of arms,
burning, or drowning. (For example, a
ghoul held underwater for 1D+1 rounds
dissolves into foul ichors, destroying it
and possibly contaminating the water
source). Some legends say ghouls could
only be vanquished by a single powerful blow (a second blow could bring it
back to life!).
Ghoul reproduction is a matter of
conjecture — some believe that those
slain by ghouls arise as ghouls, their
tortured spirits bound into dead ﬂesh.
Others believe disembodied spirits can
enter a corpse through a vile miracle or
by powerful will. Those who claim to
know aren’t talking.

Giant
Giants are humanoid but very large
— an average Giant’s thumb is as large
as a grown man. Though most Humans
think all Giants are the same, they can
actually be divided into four groups or
clans: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.

Air Giants
Air Giants are tall and slender, with
blond or white hair and blue, green, or
gray eyes. They typically wear loose robes
or tunics and capes.
Contrary to some claims, Air Giants
cannot ﬂy. They do, however, live in the
mountains, and their castles are carved
from mountain peaks. Air Giants enjoy
scaling cliﬀs and ranges and prefer the
thin, cold air of the heights. They also
enjoy looking down on the world, a habit
that causes their earthy cousins to think
them arrogant.
Air Giants live in households. Each
household has a patriarch or matriarch,
who rules the small group completely.
Below her are the house elders, then
the adults, then the children. Age and
wisdom are the important factors, not
occupation — the household members
share most tasks equally, though juniors
are often given the less pleasant chores
like scrubbing ﬂoors. Sometimes a Giant
will demonstrate enough talent with one
occupation that he is excused from any
other duties and allowed to pursue that
talent exclusively.
The Air Giants enjoy meat, though it
is hard to ﬁnd in quantity at high altitudes. They send hunters lower into the
mountains to ﬁnd goats and sheep and,
in forested areas, deer and bears. They
also hunt wild birds, especially rocs, and
have become expert archers. Of course
they only pursue animals of a certain size,
since rabbits and the like are too small
to bother. Fruits and vegetables are also
gathered, and most Air Giant households
have vegetable gardens and small farms
nestled in valleys just below the castle.
They drink cold mountain water and their
own beer, ale, and wine.
Air Giants loathe visitors. They
enjoy being above the world, watching
from afar, but they do not appreciate

•

Page 45

being disturbed. Travelers who oﬀer
something useful, whether goods or
information, might receive a grudging
welcome. Anyone else is discouraged
from climbing too high, and the Air
Giants have no qualms about killing
trespassers. Their favorite tactic is to
drop rocks on intruders.
The Air Giants do derive great pleasure from art. Most of them paint or
carve, and their castles are fantastically decorated. Others focus on cloth,
weaving beautiful garments and ﬁne
rugs and tapestries. Music is likewise
popular, and their castles are ﬁlled with
the sounds of harps, ﬂutes, and song.
A traveler who sings or plays an instrument receives a warmer welcome than
anyone else, and she may be invited to
stay more than one night, especially if
she can teach the Giants new songs.

Earth Giants
Earth Giants are sturdy and broad,
with thick features, tanned skin, and
brown or gray or black hair and eyes.
They were thick, sturdy clothing, mostly
leathers and furs.
Wanderers by nature, Earth Giants
travel widely, walking valleys and hills.
Most Earth Giants develop a set route,
and walk that path for years with little
deviation. They do not consider that
land to be theirs, however, but simply
the area they know. They are solitary
creatures and rarely form permanent
family bonds. Rather, a male and female
Earth Giant will meet, mate, and then
separate. They cross paths again every
year to exchange news and so that the
father can see his child’s progress. Once
the young Giant is old enough to defend

Page 46
himself fully, he may wander oﬀ on his
own, and he soon ﬁnds his own route.
Earth Giants rarely ﬁght each other,
since they never claim the land they
walk, and whenever two or more cross
paths, they stop, dine together, and
exchange news. Most Earth Giants do
have a home somewhere, but this is
simply a rough log cabin or a modiﬁed
cave where the Giant can leave his possessions while he wanders.
Earth Giants are fond of meat and
hunt for their food. Most carefully take
only what they need, and they often
consider themselves game wardens,
thinning herds to prevent overcrowding.
In their homes, Earth Giants brew beer
and ale and mead, which they carry in
ﬂasks and skins as they walk, but they
also drink water. The easiest way to win
an Earth Giant’s favor is to oﬀer him
beer or ale or even wine.
Though feared for their size and
strength, Earth Giants are rarely violent.
Those who live near an Earth Giant’s
route learn quickly that, as long as they
do not interfere with the Giant’s travels,
they have little to worry about. Many
actually welcome an Earth Giant’s passage — the Giant scares oﬀ or kills any
predators foolish enough to attack him,
and helps keep the entire area safe and
secure. Plus, if he is oﬀered food and
drink, the Giant not only shares news
about the region but sometimes even
aids with simple tasks like removing a
boulder from a ﬁeld or downing a large
tree for use as lumber.
The only times an Earth Giant
becomes violent are when someone
threatens him directly, or when they
threaten the region he walks. Bandits and brigands are rarely tolerated
because they can get in the Giant’s
way and because such men rarely show
respect for the land itself. Earth Giants
also dislike anyone who tries to destroy
the natural beauty of the land by cutting
down all the trees and leveling the hills
to create towns or cities.

Fire Giants
Fire Giants are powerfully built, with
hair the color of ﬂame, ruddy skin, and
eyes of blue. They favor kilts or breeches,
and rarely wear more than that.
The Fire Giants live deep below the
ground, in large caves and caverns. They
prefer volcanic regions, where homes
can have lava ﬂows nearby or even running through the chambers.
Fire Giants divide into small tribes,
each of which has a tribal chief. A council of elders selects the chief based on
wisdom and strength of character. The
council advises the chief on matters, but
the chief makes the ﬁnal decisions.
Food is difficult to obtain below
ground, and most Fire Giant tribes
survive by trading with, or stealing

from, Humans and other surface races.
Those who live near Dwarven societies
may have trade agreements with them,
but Dwarves and Giants often covet the
same territory, so such arrangements
are always strained.
The Giants hunt lizards, cast for ﬁsh
and eel, and pursue any other underground animals they can ﬁnd. They
enjoy beer and wine, but must trade for
it, because they don’t grow the grain or
fruit to make it.
Best known for their metalworking,
Fire Giants are master blacksmiths and
compete with the Dwarves to make the
ﬁnest armor and weapons. Fire Giants
have a marked advantage, however,
because they can endure heat more easily. Their forges often use running lava,
which is hotter than ﬂame, and items can
be dipped into the lava and then reshaped
immediately. Fire Giant items are stronger and more durable than Dwarven
goods, though not as handsomely crafted
— the Giants care more about function
than about ornamentation, and their
items are plain though sturdy.
Fire Giants do not like visitors. They
trade at set locations closer to the
surface and attack anyone who tries
entering their homes uninvited. They
often roam deep beneath their homes,
exploring caves and tunnels and charting the passages as they travel. They
always return home, however, and the
travel is more to make sure their homes
are safe than to explore new areas.

Water Giants
Water Giants are tall and slender, with
green or blue hair, green-blue tints to
their pale skin, and eyes of green, blue,
gray, or black. They prefer loose robes.
Just as Fire Giants leave deep beneath
the ground, Water Giants live beneath
the waves. They make their homes in deep
waters, claiming that region for their
own. Water Giants and Wavelorn (Water
Dwarves) often ﬁght over territory, and
the two races despise one another.
Water Giants build massive palaces
from the stone and coral they ﬁnd along
the ocean ﬂoor. Thus, their homes are
beautiful, with twisted columns and
shimmering ﬂoors and open ceilings.
Water Giants live with their immediate
family, but the extended family stays
in the same region and gathers once
each month to exchange news and
renew family bonds. Family members
are ranked by their age, with the oldest parent, the matriarch or patriarch,
holding sway. Each smaller family keeps
its portion of the family’s territory safe.
Beyond that, and the monthly gathering, each family can do as it likes in its
own home.
Water Giants eat mostly ﬁsh and
other marine creatures. They often
raise schools of ﬁsh for food, but hunt
other animals like sea turtles, eels, or
squid. Kelp is the primary vegetable and
cooked in a variety of ways. Water Giants

do not drink with their meals — they
have water all around them.
Water Giants are craftsmen, though
they favor carving over painting. Most
Water Giants collect coral and shells and
craft them into fantastic items, belts,
jewelry, and wall hangings. Some work
on a larger scale, constructing family
homes. Their weapons are made from
the same materials — swords and spears
of coral or bone and bows of whale cartilage with strings of woven kelp.
Water Giants are more territorial than
most of their cousins, and they actively
attack anyone who invades their realm.
This sometimes extends to the surface,
and some Water Giants capsize any
boat that passes overhead. Others do
not bother with boats unless the sailors
insult them or pollute the waters.

Gnome
Gnomes are creatures of the middle.
They are not as dour and serious as
the Dwarves, and neither are they as
mercurial or aloof as the Elves. Gnomes
contentedly occupy this middle, living
lives of quiet happiness, usually far from
large populations of other folk. When
threatened, they ﬁercely defend themselves, their kin, and their property, but
it is unusual to encounter a warlike or
hostile gnome.
Gnomes are among the smallest of
folk, with men seldom topping one
meter and women often ﬁve to 10
centimeters shorter. Broad shouldered
and thick in the middle, Gnome men
are often called stout, while matronly
is a common descriptor for gnomish
women. Both sexes of Gnomes have
coarse but handsome features, short
but strong ﬁngers, and largish feet. Men
often grow neat beards or goatees, and
the women usually wear their hair long
but bound in a pony tail or other practical style. Skin tone is usually ruddy and
brownish, like newly cut oak timbers.
Gnomish hair tends to be red or blonde,
but all colors found in Humans are seen
in Gnomes as well.
Gnomes are not great keepers of
records, preferring to live day to day.

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

They immortalize their past with poetry
and song, often greatly embellished
from the truth. Some scholars believe
the Gnomes came from blending of
Dwarf and Fairy blood, while others
insist that Gnomes came from Human
and Fey. The Gnomes merely smile
quietly to themselves, and if they do
know the secret of their origin, they
do not share it.
Natural sorcerers and magicians are
common among Gnomes, and it is not
unusual for any Gnome met to know at
least a spell or two. All Gnomes posses a
bit of magic, even if they never formally
learn any spells.
They have a natural affinity for
growing things and the softer crafts,
like leatherworking, woodcarving,
and tailoring. They also have a great
curiosity for how things work, and a
few have turned their inquisitiveness
to creating intricate mechanical devices.
Gnomes occasionally delve beneath the
ground, but usually they seek only metals for their strange devices. More often,
they’ll simply trade their foodstuﬀs for
Dwarven materials
These small folk typically build villages
in out of the way dells and valleys, steering clear of big folk and natural hazards.

A Gnomish village is a deceptively calm
place when visited by outsiders. Children
play quietly, old men talk in hushed tones
on porches, and adults go about their
business eﬃciently. If a visitor becomes
friends with a group of Gnomes, he
gets to see their true spirits, and their
propensity for fun and frivolity, which
is hidden from strangers.
These villages often look defenseless, but hidden traps, a few well placed
defensive spells, and the ﬁerce spirit of
protection that most Gnomes have can
send most invaders ﬂeeing.
Gnomes live long lives, often reaching
200 years before they are truly old. They
become adults in their late twenties or
early thirties, and settle down in their
ﬁfties. Married couples seldom split,
and large broods of children are common. A village of Gnomes is often the
extended family clan, with three to ﬁve
generations of Gnomes industriously
living together, crafting goods to trade
with the big folk.

Golem
A golem is a magical construct, an
unnatural creature created by extraordinary means for a speciﬁc purpose. A
golem can be based on any number of
diﬀerent materials, and then are given
the spark of life with magic. Golems are
not sentient in any way, nor are they particularly intelligent. Some might be ﬁnely
crafted works of art, while others are
slapped-together shambling messes.
Golems have no will of their own and
so only obey their creator and those
he designates as controllers. They are
immune to any magic that aﬀects the
mind and cannot be coerced or communicated with by anyone but their
creator and his agents. Golems suﬀer no
Wound penalties when injured — they
will continue ﬁghting at full strength
until they are destroyed.

Flesh Golem
Flesh golems are horrible in appearance, composed of stitched-together
corpses, often of several diﬀerent species. They are fast, strong, and deadly.
They normally carry a weapon of some

Iron Golem
Iron golems are the toughest of all the golems, but they
are also the most diﬃcult
to create. Most resemble
humanoid statues forged
from iron, with armor
shield and weapons. The
face is often detailed and
quite frightening to behold.
Iron golems are slow and
ponderous, because of their
great weight, but their blows are strong
enough to disable some adventurers with
one hit. Iron golems are most often used
to defend static positions where their
slow speed is less of a hindrance.

Stone Golem
Stone golems are incredibly strong
but slow. Most appear to be humanoid
statues roughly hewn from raw stone,
with little detail. They ﬁght with gigantic
stone ﬁsts and are sometimes used as
siege engines, toppling castle walls and
trampling through armies of weaker
ﬂesh beings.

Wood Golem
Wood golems exhibit the most variations in appearance of all golems. Some
are detailed, carved statues resembling
humanoids or magical beasts, while
others are tree-like clumps of wood and
branches. They are fast but weak and
less durable. A wood golem is also one of
the easiest to create, and some powerful
wizards could ﬁeld an entire war band
or small army of these brutes.

Gwyllion
The male and female Gwyllion are so
unalike as to be considered two diﬀerent species. Female Gwyllions feed on
despair. These Gwyllions are most often
encountered on roads shrouded in fog
created by the female to disorient and
confuse her prey. She can sit quietly for
days, waiting for a traveler. She prepares
for her attack by climbing to perch on top
of a boulder or pile of stones situated by
the roadside, looking like a bent old hag
with horrible features and an unkempt
appearance. If the traveler seems willing
to ignore her, she calls for help with a
pained voice, aﬀecting a harmless-seeming demeanor to lull victims.
Anyone stopping to oﬀer assistance,
ask for directions or lingering too long
becomes hopelessly lost in the fog. Victims that do not immediately attempt
to drive the Gwyllion away and begin
searching for the correct path are usually
found dead on the road several days later,
if they are found at all, their emaciated
forms indicating death by starvation.
Gwyllions are immune to all weapons
save a knife made of cold-forged iron.
Simply brandishing such a knife is not
enough, however, for the wielder must
also make a Diﬃcult mettle or Charisma
test to maintain composure while facing
this hag. If the roll succeeds, the Gwyllion withdraws without further incident.
Anyone failing the roll (or trying to use
another kind of weapon) becomes disoriented and lost. The Gwyllion creeps along
behind her increasingly agitated victims
at a distance, draining one Physique
pip or one rank of Increased Attribute:

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

Physique per hour until the victim
dies or is rescued by friends.
The male Gwyllion enjoys the
comforts of home — someone
else’s home, that is. He has
standards and despises drafty
mansions and castles. He will
wander far to settle down in a
simple cottage with a large ﬁreplace, an inviting glow in the
window, and at least one goat
in the yard (which reminds him
of a beloved Gwyllion female).
Gwyllions leave a house as unexpectedly
as they move in, but some have been
known to stay in one home for years.
Encounters with male Gwyllions
almost always start with a faint entreaty
at the threshold, followed by the unexplained unbarring, opening, and closing
of the door. Without warning, a small
ﬁgure suddenly appears standing by the
ﬁreplace along with one of the family’s
goats, neither oﬀering a clue as to how
they entered without detection. This
unexpected guest appears to be a metertall, middle-aged man with graying red
hair, dressed in a white linen shirt,
green vest, green formal jacket with
tails, knee-length brown britches, white
leggings, and shiny black shoes.
Gwyllions want only to sit by the
ﬁre and drink, but they do request
that the family keeps its goats clean
and well fed, comb their hair, and give
each a nice ribbon bow to wear. As long
as the Gwyllion remains happy in the
residence, the family’s goats produce
more milk and more oﬀspring than any
other goats in the area. Plus, Gwyllions
often assist with chores while their hosts
sleep. Male Gwyllions particularly enjoy
making honey mead, which they share
with their household. One mug of this
magical drink refreshes the imbiber,
removing all penalties associated with
missing a night’s sleep. It is dangerous in
large amounts, however, and cannot be
used two days in a row without inﬂicting
painful headaches (+10 to all diﬃculties
for 4D hours). It kills anyone drinking
it three days straight.
Peasants know to make a male Gwyllion feel at home, for anyone insulting
or mistreating a Gwyllion is cursed. If

someone speaks rudely to a resident
Gwyllion, relatively unimportant items
begin to disappear. If the insults continue, useful items begin disappearing
or breaking when used. Eventually, if the
oﬀending person does not reconcile with
the slighted Gwyllion (or even worse,
threatens him with injury), members
of the household begin to suﬀer “accidents” ranging from sprained ankles
to broken bones and even death, if the
provocation was serious enough.

Harpy

•

Page 51

Although Harpies
prefer the flesh of
sinful humanoids,
they can subsist on
any meat. They prefer carrion over live,
and they leave dead
prey in a place to
rot before consuming them. A victim
that plays dead and
bides his time may
be able to escape a
Harpy’s nest.
Harpies can be
found in nearly
any location, but
they shun colder
regions. Dead
forests , cemeteries, crypts,
abandoned
castles, rocky
islands, and
other remote
places of death
are ideal spots for harpy nests.

Harpies have the heads of shrewish, ugly, old women and the bodies of
vultures with powerful talons. Harpies
torment victims and try and carry them
oﬀ to the underworld. There were three
original Harpies (Aello, Podarge, and
Ocypete), but they have since spawned a
race of these foul ﬁends. They are always
female, always vicious, and always ready
to attack.
These creatures steal food from the
wicked or those who oﬀend their current
master. If they’re feeling particularly
malicious, they’ll instead defecate in
the food and water, intentionally spoiling it. Harpies are amazingly fast and
strong. Two Harpies can snatch up a
full-sized Human and ﬂy away with him
with ease in a matter of seconds. Some
of the creatures work for powerful evil
beings or gods.
Harpies have a social structure similar
to birds, but they will abandon their nest
to a superior opponent to save their own
skins. The creatures aren’t very intelligent, but they have an evil cunning.

Hydra
With many serpentine heads — each
able to swallow a Human’s arm whole
— and a body akin to a giant scaly dog
or kimono dragon, the hydra strikes fear
into even seasoned heroes. And, amazingly, its abilities actually exceed those
of legends; adventurers who return
with reports of these monsters have
typically only done so against younger,
weaker hydrae.
The hydra has a muscular, scaly body.
It typically keeps its four limbs on the
ground, relying on its tail for ballast and
balance. Its body is two to three meters
long. Each head is at least as long again,
with a toothy snake-like head as large as
a tiger’s. The number of heads a hydra
possesses seems to correspond with its
age and power. Young mature hydrae
have ﬁve heads, full adults have seven,
and ancients possess nine or more.
Unless injured in a recent battle, hydrae
always have an odd number of heads.
Solitary creatures, hydrae generally live in swamps, in caves by craggy
ranges, and near seaside environments.
Being cold-blooded, they require warm
climes to survive. Their eﬃcient bodies, while reliant on meat, can subsist
on one sheep-sized creature a week.
Sneaking up on a hydra is virtually
impossible, since at rest its heads dart
about independently, vigilant of its
surroundings. In addition, even when
asleep at least one head remains active
and watchful.
Because they are asexual organisms,
hydrae do not reproduce often. About
once a decade, a hydra will slough oﬀ
one of its heads, which regenerates in
about a week; the detached head slithers
away like a giant eel. Over the course of a
year, the head will grow ﬁrst a body, then
ﬁve smaller serpentine heads. Once the
new heads have sprouted, the old head
withers and dies. Sages disagree over
whether an unnaturally severed head
generates a new being, too, although
current thought suggests that a head
chopped too close to the body can
regenerate. Hydrae seem keenly aware
of their environmental impact, and do
not create oﬀspring if they could not

•

Page 53

survive. A hydra reaches maturity in
about a decade, although it continues
to grow and seems to have an unlimited
lifespan; some long-lived races report
being plagued by the same giant monster, even centuries later.
Hydrae have an arsenal of abilities
that make them formidable opponents.
Poison permeates its body, and its blood
is a powerful toxin. Some brave (or foolhardy) adventurers have even sought
out hydra blood to coat weapons or brew
deadly concoctions. Their bodies possess
remarkable regenerative abilities; even
severed heads regrow quickly. There are
only two proven ways to thwart this
healing. First, cauterizing the wounds
with ﬁre, acid, or heat causes the regeneration to slow considerably. Second, it is
possible that a large or organized attack
can sever the heads quickly enough;
if all its heads are decapitated before
they regrow, the hydra dies. Contrary
to some embellished records by survivors, hydrae do not generally spawn two
heads for each that is felled. Fortunately,
hydrae do not tend to wander, and will
usually only attack if its (expansive)
territory is violated.

but it must remain within

Leprechauns are tricksters, often
purchasing goods with gold they have
created using a spell. They go away with
tobacco and other treasures, leaving
their unwitting victim with “gold” that
will disappear in a matter of hours.
The Leprechaun’s weaknesses are his
curiosity and love of gossip. Leprechauns
are often captured while they are
rummaging through the goods of
travelers in the dark of the night.
They can be held enthralled by a
good story. A tall-tale teller can be
spared the tricks of a Leprechaun
by spinning a good yarn.
Leprechauns are found primarily in the countryside. They
will usually reside near a road or
major thoroughfare, but never in
crowded areas. They live in small
burrows or abandoned houses.

Lizard
Although normally of a small size,
the ubiquitous lizard comes in numerous forms, shapes, sizes and colors
— a testament to the species’ ability to
survive in its ecological niche. Normally,
these creatures have cold blood and
must spend much of their time sunning
themselves to power their metabolism.
The lizards’ endless variety has resulted
in subspecies with amazing strength,
rapid movement, and incredible perception. Some are the products (or victims)
of mad wizards or cruel gods, increased
to gigantic size and possessing dangerous natural and unnatural powers. For
example, crimson sandkings are large,
beautiful beasts covered in spikes and
red-and-black scales and renowned
for their awe-inspiring roar and ﬁerce
bite. Rider-lizards are enormous lizards
bigger than a merchant’s house. Domesticated beasts, certain enclaves on the
borders of warm wastelands use them
as “ships of the land,” ferrying cargo and
passengers across desolate or dangerous
expanses.
When domesticated, giant lizards
make impressive, albeit lethargic in
cool weather, guards and mounts.
Many travelers are awed with an exotic
padashah and his dual black-and-crimson sandking lizards, guarding his
throne! Additionally, a properly killed
lizard of suﬃcient size can provide
such valuables as gorgeous scaled-hide
clothing ﬁt for a princess (Diﬃcult artist

Mermaids sometimes foretell the
future, with premonitions of ships crashing on rocks or other aquatic calamity.
Scholars debate the Mermaids’ involvement in these “accidents”; do these creatures merely see misfortune, or actively
cause it? The extent they can see the
future beyond the realm of oceanic disasters is unknown, but some brave — or
foolhardy — seafaring adventurers have
sought the watery maidens’ wisdom.

mere vanity, as those skilled in the
art of divination know mirrors can be
powerful foci. Rumors tell of at least
one Mermaid possessing the ability
to transform her tail into legs, letting
her walk on land for short periods; few
choose to believe this tale.

Typical Mermaid

Mermaid
While some suggest the Mermaid
legend spawned from lonely sailors who
witnessed frolicking manatees, those
who have encountered the true maidens
of the sea know there is no comparison.
Possessing the tail of a ﬁsh and the upper
torso and head of a woman, Mermaids
are (by most accounts) stunningly beautiful, captivating, and mysterious.
Mermaids live in small groups
— called schools — of up to six who
gather in loose regions, thus aﬀording
each other both personal privacy and
group protection. When encountered
out of water, however, a Mermaid will
typically be without her sisters. They
often accompany pods of seals, and
sailors view seal activity as a possible
harbinger of the undersea maidens.
They are omnivorous, but prefer to eat
small ﬁsh, crustaceans, and seaweed
while underwater.
They typically live in temperate and
warm bodies of water, but they can
survive in any clime save the most frig-

idly cold. Although they usually dwell
in oceans, they can sometimes live in
large lakes or rivers. They must breathe
water, but they can stay out of the sea
for up to an hour; most love sunning
themselves on rocks or frolicking above
the waves.
While Mermaids seemingly share ties
to Tritons, sages remain uncertain. The
two are never seen together, and Tritons
seem far too fond of Human women.
Mermaids are graceful, curious, and
friendly yet mercurial. They can speak,
but usually do not talk at length, preferring to sing. Mermaids have been known
to entice sailors to join them undersea
as mates. Some such men are heard to
live the rest of their lives in bliss, while
others have been reportedly drowned by
their capricious lovers. Although sailors
caution each other about the danger,
many refuse to heed the warnings if
presented with the choice. The union
of a Mermaid and a Human will always
produce a Mermaid. If there is a link
between Tritons and Mermaids, such
unions might only produce Tritons, or
they may produce either creature.

Minions of
Evil
For the most part, the typical Minions
of Evil — Goblins, Gnolls, Bugbears,
Ogres, Orcs, and their cousins — are
not terribly clever and they have such
a thirst for destruction that they would
rather die in the attempt to get that one
last blow than ﬂee to wreak destruction
on another day. Occasionally, one more
intelligent than the rest arises to lead a
band to more devastating chaos.
Goblins and Orcs are both roughly
Human in appearance, generally with
lean bodies. Goblins have rough (not
hairy) green-tinted skin and pointed
features (some more than others), while
Orcs are pale or dusky (it’s diﬃcult to
tell under the dirt) with almost pig-like
facial features and often covered in
short, tough hair. Gnolls look like a cross
between a dog and a Human (they are
sometimes mistaken for werewolves),
while Bugbears resemble a bear-Human

mix. Ogres are large,
hairy creatures with
ﬂat faces who walk
somewhat hunched
due to their long
arms.
Goblins, Gnolls,
and Orcs are around
1.5 to 1.8 meters
tall, while Bugbears
and Orges are generally 1.8 to 2.1
meters or more in
height. The majority of these monsters have dark
brown to black
hair, worn in a
variety of styles
and rarely ever
washed. T hey
pre fer coars e
clothing (in keeping with their
coarse personalities), especially
untreated hides,
and decorations made from the bones of
creatures they’ve killed. Their weapons
are as likely to be sharp as not — how
well-kept their weapons and armament
are depends on how strongly their leaders can organize them for war.
Minions of evil are omnivorous.
Nonetheless, they prefer their food
to have the taint of corruption on it,
whether it be rotting vegetable, spoiled
meat, or freshly killed corpses.
These monsters reproduce themselves by one of a few methods. One
is through magical means by which
another humanoid being is tortured
into a new, misshapen form. Another
is by taking women during their
raids. The women generally don’t last
through more than one pregnancy,
due to the appalling living conditions.
All changed humanoids and oﬀspring
are male, regardless of their original
gender. A third method is by burying
dead or wounded members in magically
enhanced ground.
Wizards and rulers who acquire the
loyalty of these hordes would do well to
ensure that always give them an outlet

for their fury. Should they go more than
a day or two without harming someone
or smashing something, they invariably
turn on one another, until either they
learn of another target or they wipe
themselves out.

Minotaur
Surprisingly, those who encounter
a Minotaur and live to tell the tale do
not cite the creature’s appearance as
the most disconcerting thing about it.
Although the head of an ox atop a muscular Human body does invoke terror,
people usually remember some other
aspect as more frightening: the glint
of a blood-stained axe; the hot, angry
breath ﬂaring through its nostrils; or
the large, dark eyes too cunning to be
animalistic yet too primal to be Human.
Regardless, all agree that a Minotaur
is a terrifying creature and a fearsome
opponent.
Antiquarians disagree on how the
race of Minotaurs came into being. The
most common myth cites an unknown
king who, in his hubris, deﬁed the gods;
in turn, they exacted their revenge upon
both his family and prize oxen. Another

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

theory claims that they have existed
as long as Humans and may have even
been a precursor to humanity. Regardless, the exact circumstances of the
race’s creation cannot be duplicated or
imitated without powerful magic. The
oﬀspring of the union of two Minotaurs
will produce a Minotaur half the time,
and a Human or ox the other half. A
Human/Minotaur crossing has even
odds of producing a Human or Minotaur, and an ox/Minotaur union will
equally produce oxen or Minotaurs.
Minotaurs reach maturity by age nine
and live to be around 50 years old. However, many die decades earlier because
of their violent nature. Although
omnivorous, Minotaur behavior seems
somehow tied to diet; those who subsist
entirely on humanoid ﬂesh are much
meaner and bestial than those who eat
a more traditional oxen diet. All Minotaurs have horns, although females usually have smaller ones. Fur gradates from
their heads to
their mid-torso,

However, some
have a bull-like

Minotaurs can

that unaided
Humans can

their disdain for
heavy clothing and
most technology
keeps them from
living in extremely
cold or inhospitable environments.
They prefer to live
in caves, canyons,
or other enclosed
places — they love
mazes — but can
also build simple

dwellings. If they are not living alone
or as a mated familial herd, they form
small villages or hamlets, led by one to
ﬁve elder males, depending on the population. Larger cities seem impossible,
although some free-spirited Minotaurs
love the maze-like structure of bustling
urban life.
Individual Minotaurs can be quite
open-minded, tolerant, and intelligent,
though the obvious pun “bull-headed”
applies to Minotaur society as a whole.
They are patriarchal and chauvinistic,
and polygamous unions are the norm.
Non-Minotaur births are usually either
killed, sold, or abandoned, although one
bard tells the tale of a mother Minotaur who raised a Human son. While
Minotaurs gravitate toward all weapons
requiring more strength than ﬁnesse,
the axe remains particularly popular.

Mummy
Mummies are the carefully embalmed
corpses of important humanoids. These
creatures are animated either by a
curse or magic speciﬁcally designed to
revive them. The bodies are wrapped in
bandages that have decayed very little
considering their age. Likewise, the
corpse, although a dried husk, will be
in a remarkable state of preservation.
Mummies are always dressed in the
ﬁnery they were buried in. Very often,
they were wealthy nobles and pharaohs
in life, so their jewelry and clothing
reﬂect that.
All of a Mummy’s powers come from
magic and the supernatural. If the
Mummy had magical powers in life,
these will be greatly enhanced when
the Mummy rises. Even the dimmest of
these creatures is dangerously cunning.
Mummies with minimum magic powers make up for it in warrior prowess.
Conversely, Mummies with minimum
combat abilities have extremely powerful magic abilities.

•

Page 59

Mummies use any weapons or equipment at their disposal to further their
goals. They often carry several nonmagical personal weapons and a few magical
ones. Those who aren’t under the control
of someone else often have a legion of
living followers who hope to gain power
from their master.
Mummies do not eat. The very powerful ones look to bring themselves back
to life. These Mummies may eat, but
they do not get any sustenance from
the act unless they manage to come
back to life.
These creatures are often found in the
tombs in which they were buried. In life,
the Mummies were often rich, so the
tomb will be full of treasures, traps and
other guardian creatures. Sometimes,
due to a curse or other circumstances,
the Mummy will be forced to leave its
tomb to obtain a relic, revive an old love,
or to fulﬁll a curse.
Mummies regenerate at the rate of
Humans, but the dried condition of
their bodies makes them extremely
vulnerable to ﬁre.

Nymph
Nymphs are gentle souls who do
not wish to cause harm, though they
possess a natural ability that has been
the ruin of untold legions of men. It is
the curse of Nymphs to cause men to
instantly fall deeply in love with them.
This power has been the cause of many
tragedies, as mortals thus afflicted
slowly go insane with jealousy, attacking anyone who keeps them from the
company of their new love. Nymphs
have no control over this power, and
their grief at causing such calamity
sometimes expresses itself as a lonelysounding, wordless song that carries
for kilometers on the wind.
Nymphs appear as youthful-looking
adult Human females possessed of
unearthly beauty. They dress in tunics
and artfully draped cloths that are modest yet still hint at the curvaceous, desirable body underneath. They often pile
their black or blonde hair in elaborate
coifs, but some wear it in loose, ﬂowing
tresses and ringlets.
Lone travelers that encounter a
Nymph see a vision of their ideal mate,
their ultimate desire made ﬂesh. Even if
the encounter is brief, they can become
so smitten that they soon lose interest
in other aspects of life, casting aside
all duties to remain with the Nymph
forever. Intimate physical contact
with a Nymph is deadly to mortals,

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

a fact that saddens
Nymphs greatly, for
their lives are lonely.
A Nymphs’ mortal
lover feels no pain,
and many go willingly (to some, even
a simple caress from
perfection incarnate
is worth a thousand
deaths), but all pay
with their lives.
There are three
types known so far
— the Naiad, or
water Nymph; the
Dryad, or wood
Nymph; and the
Oread, or mountain Nymph.
Naiads are closely connected to
water, and are loath to leave it for more
than a few hours at a time. They can be
found living in almost any source of
fresh or salt water, but they choose to
live within 15 kilometers of a Human,
Dwarvish, or similar settlement. Naiads
are the shyest of the Nymphs. They can
instantly disappear beneath the surface
of their aquatic home when they sense a
stranger approaching, making encounters with them that much more special
to anyone interested in such things.
Dryads live only among the trees
of a healthy forest, and they share a
special bond with them, being able to
animate and manipulate their branches
at will. The gentle swaying of her tree’s
branches, and the Dryad’s naturally
suggestive body language have a subtle
but dramatic eﬀect on a mortal’s subconscious mind, and more often than not,
even the strong-willed succumb to the
Dryad’s curse. Dryads try to avoid being
seen by mortals, and they can quickly
escape into a hidden hollow tree trunk
to hide. The trees actually are somewhat
jealous of humanoid suitors, and they
freely give their lives in her behalf.
However, if a Dryad’s grove of trees is
ever destroyed, she too dies.
Oreads live in isolated mountain
lakes, streams, ponds, and waterfalls.
They are the least shy of all Nymphs.
They cannot be surprised, but they pretend not to notice if someone secretly

spies on them, for they enjoy this attention and make suggestive moves, such
as stretching, posing, and tossing their
long hair, in order to further entice their
audience. Considering their lonely surroundings, the promise of company is a
powerful lure. Oreads sometimes deliver
on this promise if it suits their mood,
but as with other Nymphs, intimate
physical encounters between Oreads
and mortals always end in death and
never result in oﬀspring.

Ooze
Oozes are giant, one-cell creatures
that absorb their prey. They appear as
shapeless blobs of protoplasm. Acid
oozes are gray or black, suﬀocating oozes
are white or yellow, and carnivorous
oozes are blood red.
These amoebas are nearly mindless
and have no social structure. They cannot be blinded or deafened. Oozes are
incredibly sensitive to heat signatures
that they use to track their prey. They
will not, unless starving, attack another
ooze.
Acid oozes drip with digestive juices
that quickly eat away at any organic matter: wood, leather, ﬂesh, bone, and the
like. They tend to be the largest of the
oozes (around three meters in diameter)
and never vary greatly in size. An acid
ooze cannot climb, but it can slide its
way under doors or through the tiniest
of openings.
Suﬀocating oozes are the smallest
(about one meter in diameter). They can
cling to any surface except glass. These
oozes prefer hang themselves from
a ceiling and wait for victims to walk
underneath them. Alternatively, they
conceal themselves in large jars, open
barrels, or wide vases. At the ﬁrst sign
of a heat source or humanoid-like vibration, they drop down on victims’ heads
or shoot out of containers in an attempt
to ﬁll the victim’s nasal passages, mouth,
and ears. Their digestive juices are weak,
and they must suﬀocate a victim to have
time to absorb them.
Carnivorous oozes exist as the most
dangerous of the three amoebas. A
newly budded carnivorous ooze starts
at about one meter in diameter, but they
have the ability to grow to almost any
size. Attracted by heat, blood, and vibration, these man-eaters crave warm ﬂesh
and will not consume wood, leather, and
bone unless it’s to get at their prey. The
ooze increase in size proportionally to
the amount of ﬂesh it has eaten, within
a few rounds of consumption.
Acid and suﬀocating oozes reproduce
asexually, splitting in half when they
have fed more than twice their body
weight within one week. Carnivorous

•

Page 63

oozes only split if they are over two
meters in diameter and cannot ﬁnd
food. They continue to split until all
oﬀspring are about a meter in diameter.
Carnivorous oozes that have a continuous supply of meat can grow to monstrous proportions if left unchecked.
Oozes can be found in any climate
except desert or arctic ones. Desert
conditions make for poor hunting
grounds, and arctic conditions make
them sluggish. They prefer dark, dank
places such as dungeons, castles, sewers,
and the like. It is rumored that the ﬁrst
carnivorous ooze came from the stars.

Owl
Owls are stealthy, nocturnal hunters
common to most regions. They typically prey on rodents and other small
game, holding a place of regard with
humanoids as agents of pest control.
However, several societies hold many
superstitions regarding this small
predatory bird. For some, it is thought
a symbol of wisdom, and others, a portent of death.
The common owl can be found in
wooded areas, usually near ﬁelds or
clearings, and open structures, such
as barns, stables, and towers. There it
perches, watching for a brave mouse to
appear, when it swoops down upon the
unsuspecting meal and snatches it up
with its talons. The wings of the owl are
lined with very soft feathers, which are
virtually silent during ﬂight. This makes
the approach of the bird diﬃcult to
detect if not seen before it takes ﬂight.
Coupled with amazing eyesight, any
barnyard vermin, including snakes, ﬁnd
it diﬃcult to survive for long in the open.

D6 Fantasy Creatures

One owl can eat around 1,000 mice in a
single year, making the presence of the
owl in a barn a boon to a farmer.
They are generally encountered alone,
sometimes in mated pairs near a nest.
The birds ignore adventurers who do not
go out of their way to approach them.
They have no penchant for ﬁghting, and
they retreat from any threat as large or
larger than themselves. For those who
manage to capture an owl, they collect
a high price from any wizard seeking a
familiar. Aside from the ability to ﬂy,
owls are receptive to the rituals used
to make a familiar and thus the magical
components are not as complicated as
with other species of bird.
Owls come in a variety of plumages,
most often similar to their surroundings. Snow owls are white and black
while horned owls, which are generally tree dwelling, are brown and gray
with reddish faces. These birds do
not migrate, another asset to mages,
instead maintaining their territory
year-round.

through an avian’s eyes. The caster holds
the bird and traces its body with feathers
of the same type of avian. She then traces
the feathers across her own face and eyes
and releases the avian. The caster can see
through the bird’s eyes if the Acumen die
code given by the spell is greater than
the avian’s Acumen. The caster uses the
avian’s Acumen or search to view what
the bird sees, but she cannot use her
own vision at the same time. If the bird
ﬂies out of range, the spell ends.

Pegasus
A pegasus is a winged horse, believed
to be a distant relative of the unicorn.
Like its horned cousin, the pegasus is a
symbol of purity and honor, and a ﬁerce
ﬁghter when roused.
Very little is known about the origins
of the pegasus. Some believe they spring
full-formed from the blood of certain
slain monsters, but this has never been
proven. They are known for their ability to maneuver while in ﬂight, which
gives them and their riders a distinct
advantage when battling other creatures
of the air, such as rocs.
The pegasus prefers high places for
its home, and it can often be found in
caverns on mountaintops. A pegasus
remains with one mate all his life, and she
gives birth to one foal, which accounts
for the relatively small number of the
beasts in existence. This is balanced
somewhat by the fact that the pegasus
is extremely long-lived, often surviving
until the age of 1,000. Although the

Peryton
The peryton is believed to be a distant relative of the pegasus, somewhat
similar in appearance though nowhere
near as benevolent in temperament.
The peryton is a reindeer-like creature
with great brown wings, a carnivore
that swoops down on sailing ships and
plucks mariners from the decks.
The peryton stands 1.5 meters tall,
with a wing span of three meters. It
nests on mountain peaks, and travels in
ﬂocks of a dozen or more. The peryton
is strictly a daytime hunter, preferring
to dive from out of the sun and take its
prey by surprise. Many abandoned ships
that have crashed on shores have come
to that sorry end due to the predations
of the peryton upon their crew.
Attempts have been made to domesticate the peryton, with some success,
particularly on the part of the Dwarves.
However, when the peryton has been
too long without a meal, it has no qualms
about tossing its rider and devouring
him. The peryton has even been known

pegasus is a peaceful creature, it will
challenge anything that threatens its
nest, no matter what the odds.
The pegasus is also an extremely willful creature. It will not take part in any
action it considers to be evil, and will
buck its rider if he attempts to force
it to do so.

that the shadow it casts resembles that of
a human man. Why this is so is unknown,
but sailors have learned to fear the shade
of a man cast on the waters.

Pixie
Pixies are a little over a meter tall,
somewhat chubby, jolly-looking humanoids that dress in homemade, practical
clothing — droopy but pointed red caps,
navy-blue sailor peacoats, straight-leg
brown trousers, and black, curled-toe
boots — and they always seem to have
a small lantern at their disposal (if taken
away from them, it magically returns
whenever they desire it). Pixies are solitary by nature but prefer to live only in
the largest cities (ones with thousands of
inhabitants, which provide the anonymity that Pixies prefer, since they can pass
for children in the streets and remain
ignored by the general populace).
Pixies like to make their homes in
storerooms. They prefer food shops,
woodcarving shops, or shops dealing
in books and scrolls. All they require is
a barrel to conceal their possessions, a
sack of ﬂour or something soft to rest
their heads on, and a few things to do
to pass the time when they can’t risk
appearing in the street.
Pixies do not like vermin and actively
drive all rats, ﬂeas, and other biting
insects from their local environs. For
this reason, shopkeepers who suspect
that a Pixie has taken up residence in
their store would be well advised to tie
up their dogs at night. Woe to the proprietor that causes a Pixie’s death, for
once word of the tragedy spreads, Pixies
for miles around will lead thousands of
rats and billions of ﬂeas to the oﬀending
shopkeeper’s door.
Pixies have the ability to temporarily borrow any sentient being’s “voice”
(something the typically laconic Pixies
call a chatterbox) and use it to grant an
object the power of speech. Pixies call
this “freeing” an object. Rescued from
the eternal night of thought without
expression, objects immediately begin
to talk about every subject that comes
to mind (the ﬁrst few minutes of a newly
freed object can be hard to comprehend,
as the words of a lifetime of existence
come spilling out in a torrent of enthusiastic babble). Subjects for discussion
vary with the object, which is why Pixies
truly enjoy this particular pastime.

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

Objects may answer questions,
although they cannot provide details
about things with which they have no
practical experience. (For example, a
barrel that has never held a liquid cannot describe such when asked to do so.
If shown an example, it might say that
a liquid is a clear, ﬂimsy item that has
trouble standing on its own. This is why
objects do not make reliable witnesses in
criminal proceedings.) Freeing an object
isn’t always a good thing, as many objects
only complain about their lot in life, but
some have entertaining tales to tell, and
a very few excel at telling jokes. Pixies
call these rare comedic objects “gifts”
— when one is identiﬁed, a Pixie will
do anything, even risk its own life, to
ensure that the gift remains safe from
damage (or disassembly, in the case of
complicated devices such as clocks or
siege engines).

Rakshasa
In their true form, Rakshasas are
demonic creatures with long slits for
eyes, long talons on its hands, hair of
ﬁre and ﬂesh colored blue, green, yellow, or any combination of wild colors.
The creatures also are disgustingly fat.
Fortunately for them (and unfortunately for their victims), Rakshasas are
shapechangers and can take the form of
beautiful humans of either sex and any
existing animal.
These creatures keep to their own kind,
and their society mimics a rigid caste system. Rakshasas are born into their social
class, and they can never move from it.
It is frustrating for the lowest of these
creatures, but they consider themselves
above all other humanoids.
Most Rakshasas are extraordinarily
polite, even to those that they consider
beneath them. Any humanoid that bests
a Rakshasa should watch his back because
this would be a humiliating defeat for the
creature that it could not live down.
Rakshasa live among humans in the
most crowded cities. They can wield
great magic power that can animate
corpses. They also use their magic to pull
elaborate and mean pranks on humanoids to humiliate them. Rakshasas
particularly enjoy disrupting religious
rituals and stealing horses.
Even the poorest of these monsters
is rich by Human standards. Very rarely,
one might take a liking to a humanoid
and give away some of its wealth. However, is this always done with a mind to
disrupting the local economy or making
the humanoid’s friends insanely jealous.
Rakshasa society is extremely catty. Their
squabbles are often petty social rivalries
involving who slighted whom.
Rakshasas have almost any equipment they want, but they are notoriously under prepared. They tend to wait
to the last minute to obtain important
items. If given an inordinate amount of
time to prepare for a battle, they come
well-equipped. Rakshasa often have
so many magic items that they loose
track of them.
Rakshasas love to consume the ﬂesh
and blood of intelligent beings and

horses. They can eat other food, but
they prefer these delicacies. For especially scrumptious horses or people,
the creatures have been known to trade
valuable magic secrets.

Giant Rat
In the sewers and dungeons left
unattended by civilization lurk many
monstrous creatures including these
rodents of unusual size. Many believe
giant rats are the result of the accumulation of mystical components, potions,
and untold magical waste making its
way in the bowels of the cities and
spawning mutations of the common rat.
Regardless, the origin of these creatures
is considered relatively unimportant to
the problem of their existence.
Like their smaller cousins, the giant
rat is a scavenger living oﬀ of the refuse
of people. Unfortunately, as one giant
rat can eat 100 times or more than a
typical rat, they quickly turn to predatory behavior to survive if food is not
plentiful. They even eat other rats when
starvation sets in.
The giant rat’s fur is thick and dirty,
usually dark brown or black in color. It’s
prized by goblins and other minions of
evil, who use it for clothing. Each specimen is about 20 to 45 kilograms with a
body about three-quarters of a meter,
making them more than able to drag a
child into the sewers. They often lie in
ambush near underground entrances
and snatch anything they can get their
claws on and quickly drag it, alive, to a
safe place for consumption. Unless the
meal ﬁghts back eﬀectively, a giant rat
seldom takes the time to kill its meal
before beginning to eat it.
Though fearsome in appearance and
marginally intelligent, giant rats are
not particularly brave. They have an
instinctive fear of ﬁre, and they avoid
open ﬂames and any creature aﬃliated
with elemental ﬁre.
When encountered on its home
ground, swarms of common rats often
surround the giant rat, which can direct
them to attack by squealing an alarm.
It then attacks any intruder having difﬁculty handling the swarms. The giant
rat prefers to bring its enemies to the
ground before ﬁghting them, biting at
the legs or hunching back on its hind
legs to tackle its foe. Once down, it

claws and bites until the enemy stops
thrashing. Survival, however, is always
the primary goal of the giant rat, and
it will retreat if it feels outmatched.
Many hunters consider this creature a
“cowardly” ﬁghter, sometimes trying to
barrel past groups of attackers to escape,
even when cornered.
Given a large enough food supply, the
giant rat can become a great threat to any
heavily populated areas. Packs of 100 or
more have been recorded, but smaller
groups of 10 to 20 are more common
when their population goes unchecked.
In a pack, giant rats are far more clever
and organized than the solitary rat.
Often one pack member will be forced
to sacriﬁce himself as bait for hunters,
while the others ﬂank their attackers
and ambush them from behind. The pack
leader, the largest male, avoids combat
in these situations and remains behind
the bulk of his pack. If a hunter appears
to be weakening, he attacks, hoping for
ﬁrst taste of a new meal.
Like normal rats, giant rats are widely
believed to be carriers of disease — some
even say they can transmit magical ailments with a single bite.

Roc
The largest of all raptors is the roc.
Legendary tales of these enormous
avians recount them hauling away two
and sometimes three elephants in their
talons. The truth of it is that they can
rarely make oﬀ with more than one
elephant, but tales ﬂow from river to
ocean by the ﬁre of the tavern.
The roc weights about 11 to 13 metric tons with a wingspan of 40 to 60
meters. The appearance, especially the
plumage, of these creatures depends on
their territory. Desert or mesa rocs are
white or black, sometimes a mix of both.
Forest and mountain rocs are brown
and gold, and jungle and tropical island
rocs are the most colorful and varied
with a ﬂurry of blues, reds, and greens.
Despite their diﬀerences in appearance,
they all generally attack and nest in the
same fashion.
Unlike other raptors, which generally
only make a diving pass or two at prey,
a roc continues to ﬁght if its quarry has
been lucky enough to dodge its talons.
However, the roc generally avoids landing to ﬁght, preferring to hover and rake
at potential prey while keeping its body
away from harm. Defenders without
ranged weapons will most likely not be

able to hit the hovering roc, even with
spears, as the bird hovers just out of
range. Those using thrown or ranged
weapons face a penalty of +10 to the
diﬃculty to hit a roc, if shooting from
below, due to the force of its wings
buﬀeting. Additionally, if the roc’s prey
battles on sand or loose dirt, they have a
+5 penalty to all sight-based diﬃculties
(including attacks) from the dust clouds
the roc tends to kick up.
Besides the peril from having to
face a hungry Roc swooping down on
horses and meaty adventures, there
is another threat the roc poses:
nest building. To lure a mate,
the male roc builds a large nest
on top of mountains, hills,
mesas, or sturdy tree canopies.
He collects lumber and rocks
from many diﬀerent sources,
especially those that appear to
have useful shapes or interesting colors. Many times, a roc
snatches houses, barns, fences,
towers, and — disturbingly too
often — outhouses. Stories of
entire villages disappearing
can often be attributed to an
amorous male roc keen on a
matching set of cottages to
ring his bachelor pad, with a
handy wharf for a squatting
perch. It is a macabre, though
very alluring, hatchery for the

female roc. Thankfully, the desire to
mate strikes only every few years.

Sasquatch,
Yeti
Sasquatch (or Bigfoot) and Yeti are
ape-like humanoids with nearly Human
faces. Fur covers them, brown or black
for Sasquatch and white for Yeti. Yeti
also have large fangs. Both types stand
about 2.1 meters tall when fully grown.
Sasquatches are omnivorous, but Yetis
are strictly carnivores.
Bigfoots live in small, close-knit
family units. They are friendly, gentle
creatures that only ﬁght to protect their
young. Their culture is only slightly
more advanced than the Stone Age,
so they may have simply made stone
tools. They prefer the temperate clime
of the forest. They often sleep under
the stars or among the branches of very
large trees.
The Sasquatch’s arctic counterparts,
the Yeti, are more aggressive and may
attack travelers that venture too close
to their ice caves. Yetis are solitary
creatures. Their family units break down
as soon as the young are old enough to
forage on their own. With their sharp
fangs and strong hands, they don’t ﬁnd
tools necessary.
If approached in a friendly manner,
the Sasquatch may respond to an oﬀer
of food, but they are extremely wary
of outsiders. Their society is primitive,
and even the wisest among will not
understand the ways of outsiders. Still,
they know their local forests well and are
excellent guides if bribed with food.
Yetis will devour the food oﬀered
to them and then attack to ﬁnd more.
Although they know much about the
local terrain, they do not have the
mental capacity to communicate their
knowledge. The best strategy to escape
these beasts is to drop fresh meat and
ﬂee.
Native peoples have a great respect
for these noble creatures and give them
a wide berth. Nonetheless, they consider
slaying a Sasquatch or a Yeti to be a
despicable act and can assuredly harm
social relationships with such groups.

Scorpion
The dreaded scorpion, symbol of
treachery in the desert lands, is
renowned for its ability to kill with a
quick, hidden sting. They are nocturnal predators, feeding on a variety of
insects, snakes, lizards, and mice. They
can be found in many climates, such as
grasslands, savannahs, forests, jungles,
and caves.
Study by druids and other naturalists
has revealed that scorpions locate prey
by sensing vibrations and touch. They
also have two forward eyes and from
two to ﬁve pairs of eyes located laterally
along the head and forward body segments to sight nearby objects.
With life spans ranging from three to
15 years, scorpions can easily produce
hundreds of oﬀspring over their lifetime, which molt periodically as they
grow to adulthood. In the case of giant
scorpions, created by dark druids or
insane wilderness magic, such scores of
oﬀspring can threaten entire towns.
Scorpions are generally solitary
arthropods, but some species form
temporary groups or even extended
family nests.

D6 Fantasy Creatures

Skeleton
Skeletons are the magically or
supernaturally animated bones of dead
humans and animals. They sometimes
wear the tattered remains of the clothes
and armor they wore in life and often
carry broken weapons. The eye sockets
of skeletons sometimes glow with an
eerie red light.
These undead creatures have no
magical powers of their own, but they
may wield simple magic items for attack
purposes. However, skeletons can only
be given simple commands of 20 words
or less. They follow these instructions
until their creator gives them another
or they are destroyed. They will follow
suicidal commands.
If left to their own devices, they attack
any moving target (alive, undead, or otherwise) that crosses their path, except
others who were animated with them,
until they or it are destroyed. Sunlight
does not damage them, but they tend
to dwell in places of darkness.
Skeletons do not eat, although they
will bite and scratch an opponent if no
weapon is available to them. Having no
ﬂesh, they have no need for clothing to
keep the skin in place. They carry the broken weapons and shields that they held
in life. Sometimes, they have an item of
value upon them, such as a necklace or
crown. Very rarely, a necromancer or
other commander of an undead army
will better equip the creatures and direct
them to operate siege weapons.
The bony nightmares dwell in dark
places, especially crypts. In an undead
army, they are the cannon fodder.Their
masters sometimes bury them so that
they can surprise opponents by bursting
from the ground.
These creatures cannot be healed
except through magic.

Snake
Another proliﬁc creature with an
amazing record of survivability and
diversity, the limbless snake is a peerless
hunter in its own environments. Normally too small to bother humanoids,
except through attacks triggered by a
defensive response, there are some species grown to enormous size and power.
Some even possess strange magical or
unnatural abilities.
For example, the giant snake’s need
for prey can quickly depopulate a jungle
or forest. Such beasts are often worshipped by primitive humanoids, who
feed it a steady diet of captives.

D6 Fantasy Creatures

These creatures have limited magical abilities, and they sometimes have
several powerful magic items they have
accumulated from their travels or previous victims. Even the most evil Snakewomen are level-headed individuals that
can be reasoned with. However, they do
not suﬀer fools gladly and will often kill
and eat those they consider to be of low
intelligence unless the potential victims
can prove otherwise.

Typical SnakeWoman

SnakeWoman
This creature has the head of a woman
and the body of a gigantic constricting
snake, which puts it into the half-snake
class of folk called naga. She can appear
as a Human woman, but she prefers
her snake form. When appearing as
Humans, they often dress simply and
sometimes sport tattoos that are suggestive of their true natures. Whether
appearing as Humans or their true form,
the creature can never change her facial
features by shapeshifting.
Snake-women are social, but they
avoid large populations. They enjoy
the company of Human men and will
sometimes promise them magic items
to get the men to marry them. This is a
dangerous proposition for the man for
two reasons: If the Snake-Woman is evil,
she will eat him at the ﬁrst opportunity
or whenever she grows bored of his

company. If she is good, she will take
the human to her lair for what seems
like several years, but when he emerges,
it will be hundreds of years later. If a
Snake-Woman becomes pregnant, she
will always birth another female of her
kind. The creatures prefer educated
males, especially those that practice
magic and the arts.
The strange reptiles can be found in
any desolate area, but they make their
lairs at the bottom of deep bodies of
water. Their actual living quarters contain air. These creatures are sometimes
convinced to become guardians of magic
portals, treasure vaults, or other important items. Occasionally, they guard
the previous home of a former lover,
friend, or tutor.
Snake-women have the same diet
as large snakes, they prefer to make
their lairs near places with fresh game
to oﬀer. Snake-women constrict their
victims and swallow them whole. They
eat a man-sized creature approximately
once every three to six months.

Sphinx
Mysterious and alien, Sphinxes are as
dangerous as they are inscrutable, and
none but the bravest adventurers would
face one willingly. Possessing the body
of a lion, the upper portion of a Human,
and large ﬂowing wings, the Sphinx are
frightening; in fact, some believe they
are somehow an embodiment of fear.
Sages note that Sphinxes represent an
odd juxtaposition of intellect and animalistic power and cunning, combined
with wings that put them in regions and
worlds where neither is expected.
Even the most learned of scholars
know very little about Sphinxes. The
average Sphinx is somewhat taller
than a Human when sitting on all four
legs, and its body extends about three
meters. However, they can grow much
larger. They seem unaging, and some
reports state they can continue growing
throughout their lives; one bard tells of
a band of adventurers who struggled
to climb a large sandy mound, only to
discover they were atop a giant — and
ill-amused — ancient Sphinx.
Sphinxes never sleep and do not seem
to require food, although they can eat
if they are so inclined; an irked Sphinx
might scoop up a clueless adventurer
and devour him whole, just to make a
point. Although they can reside anywhere that can support their size, they
most often live in deserts, labyrinths,
or atop mountains, spending their time
as guardians, oracles of hidden lore, or
otherwise waiting ... waiting for what,
sages can only nervously speculate. They
are invariably solitaire, except for those
remarkably rare occasions when a male
and female Sphinx have been spotted
high overhead, circling in a seeming
courtship ritual of sharp angles and
impossible altitudes. The results of these
interactions — including oﬀspring, if
any — are the deepest mysteries of a
secretive race.
When serving as guardians, Sphinxes
have a code of behavior both honorable
and mysterious. They present those they
encounter with a challenge, sometimes as
simple as a riddle or as complex as a maze
of tests or series of trials. Although these

•

Page 77

tests may be diﬃcult, they are always fair,
and Sphinxes abide by the results.
As oracles, Sphinxes sometimes freely
provide insight and knowledge, presumably to further their own goals. Other
times they only reveal what they know in
exchange for payment, such as a unique
artifact or a seemingly impossible task
(the purr of a cat, the ﬁrst dawn of last
spring, or the like). In this regard, they
favor cleverness and intellect. While
mystifying, Sphinxes still have their own
personalities; some are talkative and
aﬀable (while still remaining vigilant
to their duties), while others are gruﬀ
and quick to anger.
They are never known to attack at random or without provocation, although
several accounts have linked Sphinxes
to focused violence and destruction. In
all these cases, their mysterious devastation either ended as quickly as it began,
or else clever adventurers determined
what arcane goal the Sphinx sought to
accomplish, and appeased it through
some other means.
If attacked, a Sphinx responds with
a dispassionate precision, using its
claws to slash or strangle and its maw
to mangle the prey. It uses its ﬂight
to its advantage and
will pursue its victims.
However, its primary
duty is always to its
mission, and it will not
abandon that under
any circumstance.

Giant
Spider
Of the many types of giant spiders
roaming mountain tunnels and dismal,
dying forests, the jump spider and
the tunnel spider exist as the most
common.
The jump spider is roughly one meter
in diameter, with eight legs one-third of
a meter long. Its fur is a dingy brown in
color, with yellow and black markings.
The jump spider is a solitary creature, highly territorial in nature. It is
by nature afraid of folk, but has been
known to attack children who wander
into its domain.
The jump spider is not a web spinner,
instead relying on its agility, stealth, and
speed. It will remain in hiding until prey
is very near, then jump out and attack
(hence its name).
The ichor of a jump spider is highly
prized by many sorcerers, who use it as a
component in jump spells in place place
of frog or cricket legs (it is considered a
very rare component).
Jump spiders live for approximately
10 years, and that mate twice in that
span. The female has a three-month gestation period, laying 50 eggs at a time.
After the eggs hatch, the female abandons the young, leaving them to fend
for themselves. Only about 10 percent
of the litter survives to maturity.
They can be found in urban and rural
areas, and prefer sewers and empty
warehouses when living in cities.

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

The tunnel spider is
about two meters in
diameter with eight legs
three-quarters of a meter
in length. More aggressive and durable than the
standard jump spider, a
tunnel spider frequently
attack Dwarves and Earth
Giants.
Tunnel spiders rely on
their poisonous venom and
their webbing to capture
victims. The spider can spin
nearly one square meter of
webbing per round, and it
often leaves prey in its sticky trap for
days before coming to feed.
Tunnel spiders are carnivores, eating everything from small animals to
large humanoids. Giant is a delicacy
that tunnel spider rarely enjoys, as
most giants are strong enough to snap
its webbing.
Tunnel spiders dislike bright light,
and if suddenly exposed to torches or the
like, it becomes disoriented and unable
to act for a few rounds. The spiders will
usually try to attack from ambush and
snuﬀ out the light ﬁrst before attacking its foes.
While some can be found in rural
mountainous areas (especially on the
outskirts of Dwarven and Giant settlements), they seem to prefer the sewers
of cities, where prey is more plentiful.

Sprite
Sprites are often mistaken for playful, harmless nature spirits sometimes
encountered by travelers moving
through rural areas. These fanciful
images do a great disservice, for Sprites
are mischievous, malicious entities with
an unquenchable desire to lead victims
astray. They appear as fantastically
beautiful human women, paragons of
physical desire dressed in sheer gowns
trimmed in silver. Sprites can change
their size at will, and can choose to be
anywhere from several centimeters
in height to almost two meters tall, if
desired (those that shrink down to their
smallest height gain the amazing ability
to ﬂy, but few Sprites see any beneﬁt in
this and choose to remain humanoidsized most of the time). Few people have
ever seen a Sprite’s true form, as Sprites
are hideous creatures that guard their
real appearance with murderous zeal,
hiding it under a potent glamour.
Water Sprites are never encountered
far from the wells, streams, or other bodies of relatively calm water in which they
live, and which potential victims always
must cross in order to approach. When
a likely victim comes into view, the wily
Water Sprite engages in a craft that the
chosen mark deems important, and
pretends to be hard at work on a masterpiece. To make her ruse convincing, she
conjures up elaborate equipment, which
often seems so wildly incongruous for
the surroundings that the victim should
immediately spot her true identity and
intentions. However, at this point most
victims are thoroughly charmed (lead
a Human blacksmith to a nearly naked
sex-goddess diligently working iron on
a forge in the middle of nowhere, and
his ﬁrst thoughts are not likely going
to be, “I wonder how she got her anvil
here?”). Once her trap is sprung, the
Water Sprite reaches into her victim’s
mind and gives him a vision of a passionate embrace, all the while dragging him
to his watery death. Victims of Water
Sprites (strong and capable men, some
of them) have been found drowned in
puddles only centimeters deep, with no
signs of struggle in evidence.

Fire Sprites sometimes
choose to appear as Human
female children, because
their tactic is slightly diﬀerent. Like their name implies,
Fire Sprites delight in ﬁres
— whether setting them,
convincing others to set
them, or simply watching
a roaring blaze that happened to ignite by accident.
Fire Sprites ﬁnd it easiest
to lead children astray, so
they often appear as a child
in order to convince their
targets to experiment with setting
small ﬁres “for the fun of it.” Naturally,
she contrives to build these small ﬁres
where they will quickly get out of hand
and cause the most damage, such as in
a hay barn or on a ship at sea. Thankfully, Fire Sprites are among the rarest
of their kind.
Earth Sprites enjoy crawling around
in dark spaces, whether underground or
under a stage in a theatre, seeking lost
treasures. They would appear to share
the goal of many adventuring groups
except for one small detail — Earth
Sprites want others to remain underground forever. They will use any ruse
imaginable to convince their victims
to enter that old abandoned mine, or
rappel into the sinkhole that mysteriously opened up last week outside of
town. Then, when her victims are well
and truly cut oﬀ from outside help,
she extinguishes their lights, cuts their
rope, steals their maps, and otherwise
does whatever is needed to confuse her
victims while she works at collapsing the
entrance or obscuring the exit, entombing everyone in darkness. She remains
underground, gleefully watching from
a distance while everyone struggles
to ﬁght oﬀ panic and escape. Once
her victims ﬁnally stop moving, the
Earth Sprite takes from them whatever
baubles interest her, and then simply
burrows out of the artiﬁcial tomb to
begin seeking new victims.
Air Sprites are the most direct and
least patient of all Sprites, for they cannot stand any delay in tormenting their
victims. Once they spot a likely target, the

Air Sprite draws up a whirlwind of handy
debris — whether dust, sand, powdery
glass, or even dandelion seeds — to sting
the victims’ eyes and clog their noses and
ﬁll their lungs. It is very unpleasant to
drown in dust, or the stories say.

Giant
Squid
Most captains who return from long

squids are nothing but myths. Most sages
point out that the captains who don’t
return may have a diﬀerent tale to tell.
In fact, while giant squids — or
kraken — remain incredibly rare, almost
no other single seafaring encounter
poses a greater threat to a ship or its
crew. The giant squid can grow 18 meters
or larger, with a body four meters long, a
head and eight arms extending another
eight meters, and two vicious tentacles
that can reach another six meters
beyond that. Lesser sailors often panic
at ﬁrst sight of the head alone, with its
two eyes the size of dinner plates and
a parrot-like beak that can chop a man
in half. Underwater, its skin glows with
bioluminescence in order to ﬁnd prey.
Outside of rare mating cycles, giant
squids usually travel alone, far beneath
the frigid seas at the poles. However,
they occasionally wander brieﬂy to more
temperate regions. They might even

Stympalian
Bird
These annoying avian creatures
appear to be a combination of stork and
ibis with bronze or iron beaks, claws,
and feathers. They are only slightly
smarter than the average stork. Named
for the swamps in which they were ﬁrst
encountered, these ﬂesh-eating birds
attack any living creature that wanders
into their territory.
Stympalian birds prefer to attack as
a group. Only by killing better than half
of their number or making a loud racket
can a combatant hope to rid themselves
of the ﬂying ﬁends. The birds defend
their nests to the death if they have eggs
or hatchlings in it. Otherwise, they ﬂee
until they think it’s safe to return.
These birds prefer fresh meat, but
they have been known to eat carrion to
survive. If a victim is injured, they may
track the blood trail a short distance
and wait a few hours for a creature to
bleed to death.
These creatures only live in marshy
and swampy areas where they can build
their nests. They cannot survive in cold
or arid regions.
The feathers from a Stympalian bird
are highly valuable. Most merchants
will pay handsomely for them. Wizards
often use the feathers when concocting
potions that allow the imbiber to ﬂy.
Domesticating the birds is almost
impossible. They are foul-tempered
beasts that think nothing of literally
biting the hand oﬀ that feeds them.

Swarms
Swarms, or plagues, of small creatures
form for a number of reasons, but the
more common is devastation of habitat.
Nests of rats, ﬂeeing sewer ﬂood waters,
may combine and storm city streets,
creating havoc and spreading disease.
Forest ﬁres may drive wasps or bees from
neighboring hives into one destructive
unit. Once a swarm forms, it lasts as long
as the food supply can sustain it or until
it moves into a new area with abundant
resources. Swarms may slip through any
opening that several members of the
swarm could ﬁt in. Clever adventurers will seek ways to cause swarms to
loose strength through starvation and
survival, rather than by combat.
Unfortunately for most travelers,
swarms most often are not detected
until they are very close. With any kind
of intervening terrain such as hills,
trees, walls, and buildings, the sounds

•

D6 Fantasy Creatures

that a swarm makes are often muﬄed,
if audible at all. When the path is clear
to the swarm, they are easily spotted.
Should an adventurer stumble into a
swarm unawares, the most eﬀective
tactic is to run. Swarms will not chase
after a ﬂeeing target if at least one other
potential target remains in the area, nor
does the swarm split to follow potential
victims heading in diﬀerent directions.
Instead, they go after the most injured
or the weakest one.

Fighting a swarm with hand weapons, especially gunpowder arms, is
pointless. A pass of a sword through
a swarm may succeed in killing many
of them, but it does not reduce
their numbers signiﬁcantly. Unless
the character is impervious to
the attacks of the swarm, it soon
becomes obvious the combat is
hopeless. The only eﬀective way
of doing damage to a swarm is
with attacks that target areas
rather than individuals, such as
gunpowder bombs or spells with
area eﬀects. These attacks ignore
the scale modiﬁer completely,
calculating the combat result
and dealing damage as if the
swarm had the same scale as
the attacker. An area attack
that misses means that no
signiﬁcant impact was made on
the swarm — a few are dead, a
few move out of the way, but
the group remains basically
whole.
In attacking a swarm can
take as many actions per round as it
has Wound levels with no multi-action
penalty. (It will not take more than
that number.) Swarms generally do not
dodge, though magically enhanced ones
might. To ﬂee a swarm simply requires
an opposed running roll, though the
swarm can attack while on the move.
Small animal swarms are composed
of creatures with a small scale value
between 8 and 14. Insect swarms are
made of bugs or other tiny critters with
a small scale value of 15 to 22.

The game characteristics are for the swarm as a whole, not for the typical
individual member.
Some creatures also have venom or poison, which is injected when the

Injury to Swarms and Swarm Size

Use this chart to determine various characteristics related to injury for a swarm, as well as its approximate size. When
using the Wound levels system, ignore the game mechanic eﬀects of each level. When using the Body Points system, a
swarm receives a damage resistance roll equal to its Physique score. The increasing number of Wounds and Body Points
do not indicate an increased toughness but rather an increased resistance to dispersion. Once the swarm has no Body
Points or receives one Wound beyond its maximum, too few members remain alive or unshaken to keep the group
together. The remaining members ﬂee.

After the cleric performs the invocation according to his religious requirements, the target of the miracle is protected from insects for one meter around
his person. (The target may move.) To
ﬁnd out if the invocation repels the
insects, use the intimidation received with
the spell versus the insect’s or swarm’s
mettle. If the spell’s intimidation total is
greater than the insect’s or swarm’s total,
the creatures veer oﬀ to another, more
tempting target. Otherwise, they attack
as they had intended.
The result point bonus of the invocation skill roll may be added either to the
intimidation total or to the duration value.
(If added to the duration value, look up
the new measure on the “Spell Measures”
table in the rulebook.)
One possible component and gesture
combination is for the cleric to wave a
willow twig quickly through the smoke
of a ﬁre, until the twig becomes sooty.
The twig, which crumbles when the
invocation ends, becomes the focus of
the miracle. The components provide a
-6 Spell Total modiﬁer (or a -3 diﬃculty
modiﬁer), while the gestures of waving
and holding it give a -3 Spell Total modiﬁer (or a -2 diﬃculty modiﬁer).

Gamemasters also can use this information for swarms that don’t bite,
such as butterﬂies. As these creatures don’t have teeth or the like to speak
of, they do not receive any Strength Damage bonus indicated in the natural
abilities section. Instead of doing damage, the nonviolent swarms inﬂict
difﬁculty modiﬁers. Making a ﬁghting attack as normal, but halve the damage
total for a successful attack (round up). This is the diﬃculty modiﬁer
that
is applied to all of the target’s actions for the rest of the current round
and
into the next round, until the swarm’s turn in the new round.

Page 84

Toad
“Eye of newt, tongue of toad ... where
are my toads?!” is the oft-heard lamentation of the swamp witch, whose use of
toads as components and companions
makes for a curious mix. Toads, unlike
their watery cousins the frog, have dry
and warty skin and are not designed for
jumping long distances. Most do not
have teeth or long sticky tongues and
must stalk their prey until they chance
upon it, swallowing it whole.
Mystically, toads have many symbolic
(and real) meanings. They are associated with damp weather and bringing
rain, thunder, clouds, and, of course,
warts. Some see the toad as the symbol
of poison and concealed danger, good
or bad luck, or even Demons (some
Demon princes are deﬁnitely amphibian in appearance). An army of toads
or rain of frogs is a common means of
divine retribution, and some travelers
say such horrible events do take place
in distant lands.

Triton
Tritons take their name from the
ancient god that created them as a
race of servitors. Even though Triton
was Human in appearance, he made
his servitors in the form of half-man,
half-ﬁsh. All Tritons, from the waist up,
possess well-developed Human torsos
with dark, curly hair (male Tritons
do not possess facial hair). From the
waist down, however, all possess the
lower bodies of various ﬁsh-like sea
creatures. Their Human-like features
and physiques are well proportioned,
well deﬁned, and smooth.
At ﬁrst glance, Tritons have a uniform
appearance, but they actually diﬀer in
signiﬁcant ways. From the waist down,
one variant has the scaled body of a
large ﬁsh, complete with ventral and
dorsal ﬁns and a broad tail. A second
variant has, instead of a single ﬁsh
tail, two serpent-like tails that end in
needle-sharp spines. The third variant
has a ﬁsh tail, like the ﬁrst variant, but
possesses ﬁns running down his human
forearms and back, and his ﬁngers are
webbed. All can maneuver on dry land
almost as well as a Human, despite their
apparent icthyian handicaps.
If male Tritons love anything more
than lounging on a sandy ocean beach,
drinking wine from amphorae, and eating ﬁgs and stuﬀed grape leaves, it must
be the pursuit of human females. Triton
created his servitors out of a sea-going
people who turned their backs on land
and oﬀered themselves to the gods of
the sea. Female Tritons found a paradise
beneath the waves in their new forms,
but it is said that male Tritons secretly
regret the decision. Nowadays, whenever they get the chance, male Tritons
go ashore in search of human female
companionship.
One famous story tells the tale of a
male Triton named Nikos who wooed
and won the hand of a human female
named Rina. Together they swam to
an uninhabited island and lived their
days in bliss, far from the world of men
and ﬁsh. Many male Tritons dream of
securing such a future for themselves,

but the reality is much diﬀerent — while
Tritons are often considered alluring by
Human females, Human males cannot
abide the thought of such “unnatural”
unions. Discoveries of terrestrial incursions by Tritons often leads to severe
retaliation, and few Tritons escape back
to the sea in one piece.
Triton society as a whole deems the
victims of such punishments to have
brought it upon themselves, and thus
turn a blind eye. Occasionally, however,
an overzealous (and jealous) group of
land-dwellers gets it into their heads to
capture and kill every Triton they can
ﬁnd, sending out special raiding boats
armed with barbed nets. Often dozens
of Triton are caught and killed before
Triton society can muster its forces for
a counterattack on the land-dwellers.
Tritons arm for war much the way
Humans do, with large, round shields,
Spartan-style helmets, and spears, all
fashioned from bronze that almost
glows green with verdigris from exposure to saltwater. Attacks on humanoid
settlements begin at the height of
storms, when the gods of the sea are
at their strongest. Even though their
wrath, once invoked, is legendary,
Tritons don’t actually kill many people

Troll
Accounts vary widely about the
abilities and descriptions of these horrible beasts. The version of the Troll
recounted here exhibits some of the
best and worst accounts, presenting a
powerful adversary.
Trolls are humanoid, averaging two
to three meters in height and 115 to
180 kilograms in weight. They have long
spindly arms and legs and soft-looking
pot bellies. Skin tone varies, ranging
from nut brown to ﬁsh belly white, and
most Trolls have little or no hair on their
head or body. Despite their appearance
of softness, Trolls are devilishly strong,
with have powerful claws and teeth.
They are strictly carnivorous and require
a lot of meat to fuel their heightened
metabolism.
Most often found in dark caverns or
deep forests, a Troll’s greatest weakness is the light of day. Each round
of exposure to the daylight (even on
an overcast day) causes a Troll harm,
eventually hardening the Troll into

stone. This damage is not regenerated
and must be healed normally. Trolls
that live on or near the surface world
spend the daylight hours lurking under
bridges, hiding in abandoned castles, or
crouching in dark caves. They come out
at night to hunt, and they eat any living
thing they ﬁnd, although they seem to
prefer sentient creatures for food.
Trolls are usually solitary hunters,
but they can be found as mated pairs
occasionally. If food is plentiful, they
may join together into packs, ruled by
the strongest, oldest member. These
packs seldom last long and often end in
cannibalism as the stronger Trolls eat
the weaker after they have devoured all
the other food in an area.

unwitting young son.
They are usually
encountered alone,
although it is possible
to encounter a group
— called a blessing — in certain circumstances, especially during eminent
threats to good and love. Most notably,
bards speak of a meeting held once a
decade called the Parliament of Virtue, where dozens or even hundreds
of unicorns gather for one night; the
purpose of this assembly — if true
— is unknown, although one minstrel
claims to have witnessed the Parliament bestowing some kind of boon on
a Human, apparently summoned and
charged with defending their virtues in
places where unicorns cannot tread.
Scholars are unsure how the majestic
beasts come into being, although they
generally agree that unicorn numbers
are dwindling. A popular hypothesis
maintains that one in a million births
among wild horses is actually a unicorn;
another theory states that an act of great
selﬂessness, love, or sacriﬁce might cause
one to spontaneously come into being.

Even when confronted with overwhelming evidence, some scholars
steadfastly refuse to admit the existence of so-called “fantastic” creatures,
dismissing them entirely as ﬁctional
embodiments of various fears. However,
even they will grudgingly admit that
at least one creature deﬁes this mold,
stemming not from a world of terror
and despair, but one of honor, purity,
and hope — the unicorn.
At a casual glance, it may be possible
to mistake a white unicorn for an ordinary — if remarkably regal and beautiful — horse. Physically, the unicorn is
quite similar to a ﬁne equine specimen.
However, it also possesses a spiraling
horn on its head; at a mere half-meter
long, this outward appendage marks its
true pedigree, as well as the source of all
its power. unicorns also have goat-like
beards and cloven hooves.
Naturalists debate the exact magical
abilities of unicorns. At a bare minimum,
all unicorns seem to possess healing
and curative abilities, including the
neutralization of poisons and disease.
Some unicorns, especially older ones,
seem to possess other magical abilities,
and many miraculous deeds have been
attributed to them. Regardless, the
hypnotic glow of a unicorn’s horn always
signiﬁes a moment of powerful good.
unicorns are herbivores, subsisting
on grass and other plants. They live
almost exclusively in temperate forests,
but tales have placed them rarely in cold
mountain valleys or blistering deserts.
Although androgynous, a white unicorn

Vampyr
Vampyrs were once Human, Elves,
or another similar race who have trade
their mortality for a near-immorality
and all the fears and power that goes
with it. Their skin is pallid and their
canines are slightly longer. Some older
Vampyrs have claws and animal facial
features. Most Vampyrs were beautiful
when they were alive, but their undead
status adds treachery to that beauty.
Most Vampyrs prefer to dress in the
same clothes they wore when they were
alive. The older a Vampyr gets, the more
lavish the creature’s taste in clothing
and other luxury items.
These creatures follow complicated
social structures based on what their
sires were accustomed to when they
were alive. These organizations range
from tribes and clans to ﬁfes and guilds
to clubs and gangs. Most Vampyrs share
the same view that they are superior to
mortal creatures. Vampyrs treat their
servants well, but they are ultimately
expendable.
These creatures of the night often
employ a cover persona to explain their
nocturnal habits. They are well aware
of their many weaknesses and often
go to elaborate lengths to prove their
humanity to the suspicious.
More often than not, a Vampyr uses
intermediaries on all foes except those
he wishes to feed upon.
The creatures tend to pick isolated
lairs: castles, cemeteries, abandoned

Typical Wendigo

Wendigo
The wendigo is an angry spirit-animal.
It’s so thin, the creature cannot be seen
from certain angles. When it can be
seen, it resembles a monstrous, ﬁvemeter-tall creature covered in fur, with
red eyes and enormous sharp teeth. It
is semi-transparent and moves as fast
as the wind.
It is said that the wendigo is created
from the spirits of those driven insane
by the wilderness. Native peoples greatly
fear the monster, and those that report
an encounter with it are considered
either extremely lucky to be alive or
extremely unlucky, as it is considered
an omen of death and destruction.
A wendigo is always encountered
alone and only by groups that venture
into its territory, especially hunters and
loners. It whispers and teases its victims,
tracking them for days across desolate
wastes. It hounds its prey until the victim returns to civilization or is caught

Werewolf
Werewolves are Humans inﬂicted
with lycanthropy, a mystical malady
that causes involuntary transformation
to and from a wolf. Lycanthropes have
three distinct transformation phases:
Human, wolf, and fusion. Their Human
forms are identical to their pre-infectious states, and their wolf forms are
similar to those of regular wolves, relying on instinct and animalistic cunning
to survive. The fusion form is a terrifying
carnivorous amalgam of Human and
wolf. It stands erect on two feet, 2.5
meters or taller, with fur all over its
body, talon-clawed hands, and a face
with truncated wolf-like jaws. With the
intelligence of a Human and the cunning
and ferocity of a wolf, the fusion form
is the vessel of a pure killer. Although
legends indicate that lycanthropy can
be transmitted from being wounded
by a Werewolf, it seems that only the
fusion form permits this.
While a being infected with lycanthropy creates a dangerous predator,
a Werewolf also possesses a number of
drawbacks. First, it lacks much of the
self-control and reason of a Human; the
hunting instinct proves too powerful
for most victims to restrain. Second,
while in fusion form, a Werewolf takes
considerable damage from silver.
Third, it cannot fully control how it

•

Page 91

changes. Werewolves
shift involuntarily to
their fusion form at
midnight two days
before the full moon,
and change again
into that form every
midnight until two
days after the full
moon, for a total of
ﬁve days in a lunar
month. Werewolves
have a target of
their killing fury,
which they feel
compelled to kill
once they assume
their fusion form.
This target varies
from Werewolf to Werewolf; targets include family members,
children, enemies of their faith, or all
humanity. In general its goal is broad
enough that the wolf has little fear of
ever running out of quarry. Whether
this savage goal is determined randomly,
by subconscious desires of the victim, or
some other means is unknown.
Until the Werewolf satisﬁes this bloodlust, it is apt to attack without reason
or remorse. Once it has slain one of its
targets, the madness calms. For the rest
of the evening, the Werewolf can shift
between any of its three forms at will.
However, if the Werewolf is wearing its
wolf form when the ﬁrst rays of dawn
strike it, it will retain that form until its
next transformation. Otherwise sunlight
reverts the Werewolf back to Human
form, where it is likely to collapse in
exhaustion and memory loss.
There is no certain way to rid someone
of lycanthropy, although all mystics
agree that it is possible. Cures have
included rare plants (such as wolfsbane from certain regions or picked at
certain times), slaying the Werewolf
that infected the victim, and true love.
Death also reverts a lycanthrope to its
breed form, although that is a less than
helpful remedy for most.
Werewolves are always solitary,
although bards tell of a group of likeminded Werewolves who worked
together as a “pack.” If this story is true, it

is unknown the ﬁnal fate of this fearsome
group. Sages posit that other sentient
creatures can become infected with
lycanthropy, especially older races. It is
also suspected to be at least theoretically
possible for a wolf to become infected
and turn into a Human, although the
implications are troublesome.

Only the alpha pair is generally permitted to breed. Wolf litters consist of
ﬁve or six cubs, which grow to physical
maturity in their ﬁrst year. Once a wolf
pack has grown too large, members may
splinter oﬀ to form their own packs in
new territories. Wolves have a lifespan
of around 10 years.
Although wolves traditionally only
attack weak, frail, old, or young prey,
they have been known to attack
Humans, especially if they feel threatened. The ﬁrst sign most explorers who
stumble across wolf territory have of
their transgression is of fearsome howling, which wolves use to warn intruders,
assemble the pack, or bond socially;
those who have not previously formed
respectful bonds with wolves would be
wise to leave in that situation.

Yara-Ma-Yah-Who do

they sometimes use it to

Yara-Ma-Yah-Who appear as short,

Zombie
Zombies are normal humanoid
corpses that have become animated.
These creature can be in any state of
decay and often still bear the fatal
wounds that turned the living humanoid into a dead one. Also known as the
Living Dead, Zombies almost always
remain in the tattered clothes in which
they were created. The longer a Zombie
survives, the more tattered the clothes
and the more decayed and rotting the
body. Some creators graft armor and
weapons onto their newly undead
followers, making them more lethal.
Others try to make their Zombies carry
weapons, but they drop them after their
ﬁrst successful feeding.
Ninety-nine percent of all Zombies
are mindless, so they lack any noticeable
social structure. Existing only to feed on
the ﬂesh of the living, Zombies can still
somehow sense other undead and will
not attack them. A tiny percentage of
these creatures retain a dim recollection
of other impulses that drove them when
they were alive. These Zombies sometimes help living humanoids escape or
use their knowledge to bypass more
complex defenses. Only an extreme
emotional state at the moment of death

D6 Fantasy Creatures

can create these smarter Zombies, and
they are only dimly aware of these other
impulses.
Zombies are divided into two subcategories: supernatural and diseased.
Supernatural Zombies are created by
supernatural means, either through
an ancient relic or powerful spellcaster.
or cleric These Zombies can only be
stopped by destroying the magic or holy
item or person who brought them to
life. Short of complete obliteration by
ﬁre or extreme energy, these Zombies
continue to return and attack. These
Zombies do not create other Zombies
unless that is part of the magic spell
that initially created them.
Diseased Zombies are created through
a fatal infection that turns the victim
into a Zombie. It is the Zombie’s brain
that keeps the creature moving, so
severe trauma to that area or beheading
destroys the creature. One bite from the
diseased Zombie can slowly transform
a victim into a Zombie unless the disease can be cured or the infected part
of the body can be amputated before
it spreads.
Zombies of all types do not gain
sustenance from eating ﬂesh, but some
scholars theorize that this action somehow eases the pain of death. Some
types prefer certain
body parts, such as
hearts or brains,
possibly because of
the greater concentration of life force
there.
Zombies not

aimlessly until
their ﬂesh and

muscles completely fall oﬀ, providing
them with nothing to keep their bones
together. In very rare instances, magical
Zombies will turn into Skeletons. Only
specially crafted magic or miracles can
heal them, control them, and extend
their ability to survive. Zombies never
recover from physical damage on their
own.

• D6 Genre Conversion •
Because the skill resolution and damage mechanics are the same in all of the
genre rulebooks, the only parts you need
to convert to use this supplement in
another are skills and attributes.
As with all conversions, this one gives
you a starting point. Once you’ve made
the conversion, you may want to move
some pips around, so that they better
reﬂect your idea of that character’s or
creature’s abilities.

Base Attributes
The attributes used in D6 Space
do not corresponding directly to the
attributes speciﬁed in D6 Adventure or
D6 Fantasy. The accompanying tables
oﬀer the best and quickest equivalents
for each attribute. The top one is for
characters, and the bottom one is for
nonsentient beings, such as animals
and monsters.

Base Skills
Some skills convert smoothly from
one genre to another, though you might
need to move them from one attribute
to another. With others, one genre rules
set represents them with one skill while
another uses two or more. (For example,
marksmanship in D6 Fantasy translates
to ﬁrearms, gunnery, and missile weapons
in D6 Space.) The Skill Conversion List
oﬀers the best ﬁt is listed ﬁrst, followed
by other options should you want to
have a “contemporary” version of the
character or creature.
When you have to move a skill from
one attribute to another or split the
skill among multiple abilities, you need
to know the number of skill adds. You
can ﬁgure out this by subtracting the
old skill from its governing attribute.
This is the value of the skill adds for
that skill. (Remember that three pips
equal one die.)
Example: Disguise is under Presence
in D6 Adventure and Acumen in D6 Fan-

tasy. If your D6 Adventure character has
4D+1 in disguise and 2D+2 in Presence,
she has 1D+2 skill adds in disguise.

for gamemaster’s characters where you
aren’t concerned about the total number
of dice used to make the character.

If two or more skills translate to a
single skill in the new genre, there are
two methods of handling this:

If the old skill equates to multiple
diﬀerent skills in the new genre, either
put all dice into the skill that best ﬁts the
character concept or divide the dice from
the old skill among the various skills. If
you have dice leftover from converting
multiple skills to a single skill, you may
divide the extra dice among the multiple
new skills.
You can, of course, add any skill from
any genre to any other genre, if you
think that it will get suﬃcient use in
your adventures to warrant including
its ability category.

1. The new genre’s single skill receives
the skill adds from the highest skill in
the old genre. If this is a player’s character, reserve the other dice for skills that
equate to two or more skills in the new
genre. Extra dice that cannot be used
to purchase skills may be converted to
Character Points on a “one pip for one
point” basis. For gamemaster’s characters, ignore the extra dice.
2. The new genre’s single skill receives
the skill adds from the lowest skill in the
old genre. Other skills equivalent to the
new skill become specializations of the
new skill with specialization bonuses
equal to the diﬀerence between the
single skill’s die code and the old skill’s
die code (minimum of +1). This is best
