Stand for survival.
A bear’s head and neck conveys its mood
because their torsos and short tails are not
suited for this purpose. Agitated bears walk
with their heads below their shoulders,
salivating or showing teeth. They may also
growl, state with their ears laid back, or
turn sideways to display size. Ifthese tactics
fail, a bear might pop his jaws, swat, bluff
a charge, or, in rare cases, attack. The bears
may scoop up victims in their claws and
crush them in a massive hug.

Black bears dwell in the northern Rocko
ies, western Canada, and Alaska. These
voracious omnivores usually lead solitary
lives. Forests with prominent undergrowth
are their ideal habitat. They hibernate for
ﬁve to seven months in small caves or

to ﬁll their stomachs with 70 kilograms of
meat. An adult bear’s forepaws, which can
measure 30 centimeters across, can pull a
mature seal from beneath the ice. Polar bears
can reach speeds of 40 kilometers per hour
for short distances and have white to yellow
fur. Their well—insulated bodies make them

invisible to infravision. Males can weigh
one metric ton but typically fall between
500 to 600 kilograms. Females average 300

kilograms in weight. Males never hibernate,
though pregnant females will hole up in a
den until they give birth to their young.

To the ordinary eye, a candyman look like a
normal member of the community in question.
To those who can see such things, they appear as
hideously deformed humans with long, sharp claws
and needle-sharp pointed teeth. One can tell the
passing of a candyman by the sweet odor that fol—
lows it wherever it goes.

The creature creates a lair in a cave or hidden
shack just outside the particular community it has
chosen to terrorize. The hideous creatures are always
found alone.
Any child who approaches the seemingly friendly
entity is given a piece ofcandy and a small trinket of
some kind ~— a block, a wooden train, a slingshot,
or some other toy suitable to the child’s interests.
As long as the child keeps the toy in her possession,
the child thinks about the candyman and wants to
spend more time with “him.” Once the child eats
the piece of candy, she seems to become obsessed
with the “strange visitor” and she tries to ﬁnd his lair.
As the child searches the area, the candyman, in its
true demon form, attacks and captures the child. A
captured child is subjected to horrible psychological
tortures, primarily to generate fear; Once the child
has begun developing an immunity to the terrors of
the candyman, the child is slain. If the child throws
away the toy, the child is free of the creature’s grip.
Due to the obvious nature of the candyrnan’s
attack, they normally must ﬁnd a new community
after abducting only a few children.

the crow’s mystical ties cover the realms of death,

discord, divination, hard luck, harmony, mystery,
and resourcefulness. In the modern era, many
mystics summon crows to serve as their familiars,
using the creature’s commonplace features to avoid
suspicion. For those who see signs in the natural
world, the appearance ofa crow has great meaning,
often sending the viewer down a new or different
path.
In combat, alone crow ﬁghts to escape. A typical
tactic is to take one swipe at an opponent, putting

it on the defensive while the crow ﬂies away. Once
it gains enough distance, the crow will land and
reconsider its options, tending to shy away from any

threats. In mass, a murder of crows earns its name
quickly and brutally. A group of 10 or more crows
will often attack by diving from the sky and pecking
with their beaks (attacking as one and adding an
additional +2 to the damage total for the group).
On the following round, the murder will take to
the air again, preparing for another dive. While no
single crow can take out a larger opponent on its
own, the massed attack assures that one or two get
in a critical lucky shot.
A crow is quite trainable, and it can use its beak
to perform complicated maneuvers, such as picking
up objects and putting them in open containers.
A typical crow can ﬂy for hundreds of kilometers
without rest, or longer if the thermals help them.
Crows
excellent foreshadowing
characters may need to take. Consider having a crow
appear as a harbinger just before the beginning ofa
large battle. Use the image ofthe crow in an ancient
text or series ofhieroglyphs to provide a warning of
what it to come. When an adventure provides two
paths, the appearance ofa crow tactfully supporting
one or the other can be taken as a sign.

these can be conﬁrmed.
The term “demon” is an evocative one
that summons up images of realms ﬁlled

with ﬁre and brimstone, populated by
twisted, serpentine entities that long to corrupt the souls of humans, leading them to

, ‘ ruin and death and then consuming them.
While this image is somewhat dramatic and
overly simpliﬁed, there’s a kernel of truth
in it. Demonkind originated in a distant
realm very similar to the one that most
uneducated people imagine, but they have

evolved just as humanity has evolved and
thus are very diilerent creatures today.
Most ofthe creatures humanityclassiﬁes
as demons are, in essence, extradimensional

spiritual parasites. Their home realm
borders closely on the prime dimension,
and contact between people and demons
ﬁrst took place very early in history. While
demons are easily as varied as humans,
_, there are certain innate qualities that all

posses that can be used to gain a better
understanding of their enigmatic race.
First and foremost, demons appear to
be immortal. Occult lore indicates that
demons contacted centuries ago can still be
reached in their home realm by conduct—
ing the proper rituals. Some paranormal
experts have theorized that the laws ofphysics are radically different in the demons’
home realm and that the passage of time
simply does not exist.
in addition to immortality, demons are
immune to poison and disease, as well as

many sources of physical injury. if some
how killed while in another realm, demons
reform in their home realm, weakened but
' alive. The only apparent means ofdestroying a demon is to kill it in its home realm,

a task that might well be impossible.
Demons also possess atleast some degree
. of mystical power. Again, this appears to
be a manifestation ofthe radically dilierent

laws ofphysics that govern their dimension.

Finally, demons appear to be at least
partially parasitic. While they do not
require it to survive, they can feed on the
life essence, or soul, of intelligent beings.
Theyarepatient creatures, willing to impart
portions of their power to humans in
exchange for harvesting their souls upon

death. While the creatures will gleefully
manipulate events to hasten the death
of one with whom they have made a bar.
gain, they can neither violate the terms of
their agreement, not harvest the souls of
humans who do not willingly surrender
them. This parasitic feeding appears to
increase a demon’s power, and it may

be possible for lower demons to ascend
to demon lord status by feasting on a
sufﬁcient number of souls. It’s theorized
that demons are capable of feeding upon
one another, but this has not been proven
and would seem to imply that very few
would still exist.
Quantifying the many different types
of demons encountered to date would
be an exhaustive task. Instead, they have

been grouped into broad categories based
on approximate power level and average
abilities.

Imp
lmps are minor demons, with few
physical or mystical powers to their name.
Ironically, they seem to have a much easier
time crossingthe barriers that separate their
home realm from the mortal world. Some
occultists believe that this is a result of a
natural ﬁlter that prevents large amounts
of infernal power from leaking into other
worlds. lmps, then, have so little power
that the ﬁlter does not affect them.
in any event, imps tend to be physically
small, no more than a meter in height
when standing. They almost always have

The transient nature of traveling shows
such as carnivals and circuses lure all man,
net ofstrange characters and mystical enti~
ties. it’s for good reason that carnie folk are
highly superstitious; interlopers carrywith
them a sort of supernatural baggage that
ﬂourishes in the soup ofsin and innocence
that pervades the big top. One ofthe many
types ofparanormal denizens ofthe travel-

ing show are the evil clowns.
While not as common in circuses and
" carnivals as ghosts and specters these
creatures are far more dangerous. Com—
monly, they serve as minions ofa powerful
' spellcaster and come in bands ofﬁve to 12,

, depending on the size ofthe travelingshow.
’

Once simple performers, these clowns are
hosts for minor spirits, summoned by the
controlling mage, and are used to fulﬁll
the evil schemes of their master.
Aside from the tendency for sadistic
behavior, which can be reigned in by the
master, these minions can be detected by

. their faces. 'lhe heavy makeup that the evil

ihe only way to end the existence of
the solitaire is to restrain it with bonds
made from its home ground, generally the
remains of the carnival, circus, or amusement park it haunts. These bonds must be
sturdy enough to contain the creature, as
they have no special ability to neutralize his
supernatural strengdi and cunning. Once
restrained, on his territory, the evil spirit
must then be exercised from the person.
if the clown has been possessed for some
time, the man or woman left behind will
generally be an insane shell ofa person who
would require years, perhaps decades, of
therapy to rehabilitate. However, as long
as the host lives, there’s a chance the angry

One type of evil clown is the killjoy.
They wear bright, multi-colored outﬁts,
and their faces appear to be covered with
red and white makeup, forming a large
smile on their face —— in truth, this is the
“natural” coloration of their skin.
Killjoys prey upon solitary people or
small groups. They tend to stay in the
shadow until they spot a victim. They then
use their abilities to root the person to the
spot. Once this is accomplished, the killioy

performs bizarre and gruesome “tric ,”
while the victim is unable to run away.
Examples of tricks include:

' Reaching behind the victim’s ear and
“finding” a large, live, squirming rat.
' Performing a card trick in which the
cards are decorated with drawings of the
people being killed in a variety of ways.
' Hitting the victim in the face with a
pie ﬁlled with blood.
Though these tricks are terrilying, they
are not dangerous. Killjoys will seldom
murder lone victims since it is essential that
there be a survivor to spread the word of
the killjoy. When more than one person is
encountered, however, the killjoy usually
picks the victim at random, in a drawn—out

process designed to instill terror in all ofthe
people present. Once the victim is dead, the
killjoy takes a bite out of the corpse with

its long, razor-sharp teeth. At this point,
its job done, it abruptly turns its back on
its victims and walk away. More than one
killjoyhas fallen to a sudden, furious assault

by the frightened, but enraged friends of
the victim.
Killjoys never seem to speak, although
whether this is voluntary is unknown. 'lhey
are generally solitary creatures, though
they may work with popweasels or one
other killjoy. During the day, they hide
in deserted buildings and fight furiously
if discovered.

There have been recorded instances of
evil mimes as well, but in the realm of
the underworld they are considered the
“near—beer” of henchmen.

Popweasels are vicious horrors used as a
tool by killjoys, who normally choose the
victim. 'lhe killjoy places the popweasel
where it can be found.
Popweasels resemble a jackrin—the—box

former image ofa toy clown is replaced by
that of a demonic creature. It will tower
on its spring, hovering over the child,
_ and strike the child several times before
retreating into its box.
At this point, the child will probably
, want to stop playing with it. Popweasels
get around this in two different ways: First,
the popweasel can leave its box for a short
period oftime to steal small items, which it
leaves partiallysticking out ofits box so as to
“ implicate the child. Second, the popweasel
eventually starts working the crank on its
box from the inside, thus frustrating the

child’s eflorts to ignore or avoid it.
Eventually, matters come to a head. The
child usually confronts his parents and
“ demands that it be removed. Either the
parents open the box to refute the child,
or the popweasel open the box itself. At
this point, it appears in monster form and
, attacks the entire familywith the intention
of killing everyone. Should the family try
to run away, it jumps out of its box and
pursue them on foot.

Cults have existed nearly as long as
civilization. Humanity is a fractious, con—
ﬂier—prone lot that seeks a homogeneity
that historically has proven impossible to
achieve. Since the dawn of time, people

have tried to convert others to their way
I. ofthinking. This has been true ofphiloso'
phy, strategy, efﬁciency, and perhaps most
importantly, religion.
In more primitive times, men and

women worshiped a vast variety of gods,
some ofwhich allegedly were the incarna—

i tion of dark, evil impulses that dwelled in
, the back of every mind. As often as not,
these religions were merely an excuse for
its adherents to indulge in the basest, most
vile practices without the need to feel guilt
or concern for their actions. Such religions
often preached violence, and conﬂicts with
other religions were common. In time,
these widely reviled groups were crushed
beneath the heel oflarger groups who could
- not tolerate their excesses, either because
it offended their own religions tenets or
because they found the cult’s practices
deplorable on a personal level. Because
of this history of persecution, those who
worshiped dark gods or conducted dark
practices learned to conceal their actions
from others who might destroy them for
their “blasphemy.”
Over the course of thousands of years,
the term “cult” has come to have a number
of meanings. The types of cults discussed
above still exist, certainly, hidden in the

crannies of society so that their mem—
bers might worship evil powers in hopes
of achieving some level of that power
themselves. The term cult also has come
to apply to the followers of particularly
charismatic individuals, however, who
may not necessarily preach a particular

religious dogma. Often these individuals
“ take an established religion and alter it to
suit their needs, perhaps changing a respect
for mercy into the notion ofshowing mercy

Traditional fanatical cultists are a fur~
rive, maniacal lot. They adhere to religious
strictures that most cannot understand
while willingly participating in rituals that
virtually every established religion would
ﬁnd both degrading and repulsive. They
typicallygive their lives for the cultwithout
hesitation, certain in the notion that they
will be amply rewarded in the afterlife.
These individuals may possess some sort
of mystical abilities, if their dark patron
is a legitimate entity willing to invest in
its followers, or they may simply have

away from sin into a mandate to eliminate
sinners altogether.

The more modern incarnation ofa cultist is a fanatical follower of some radical
splinter religion, aweak—minded innocent

who has effectively been brainwashed into
accepting a doctrine they might otherwise
ﬁnd offensive. Their zeal makes them
dangerous, and like their traditional
counterpart, they all too often offer
up their lives without hesitation. Such
individuals often have access to military—
grade ﬁrearms, as violence is a mainstay
of many modern cults.

Fey Folio
Fey folk come in many forms; among the most
often seen manifestations are the brownie, the fairy,

the leprechaun, nymph, and the pixie. These are not
the only forms that the fey folk come in, as they
are associated with everything in nature and some
artificial constructions as well.
Brownies are tied to their natural surroundings,
mostly to wooded areas, never venturing more than
a half a kilometer from their home trees in their
L lifetime.
‘ duty to keep the

a distrust ofhumanity because they mostly see only
the destruction that they bring.
They vary from ﬁve to 15 centimeters in height
and are nearly weightless. They have dark brown
skin and clothes that allow them to blend into the
background. Most of the time, they’re found in
form—fitting brown tunics and peaked caps. Their
hair color ranges from dark blonde to dark brown.
They have delicate four—section wings that look very
much like a dragonﬂy’s wings on their otherwise
humanoid bodies.
Brownies live between 70 and 100 years if their
tree is undisturbed, but they will perish within a
few days if it’s killed and the brownie cannot ﬁnd
an unoccupied tree.
The brownie community usually only consists
of a few dozen brownies at most, and a forest may

kilometer. The oldest male heads each brownie
community, and the oldest male in a contiguously
wooded area is declared the brownie king. His word
is law throughout the woods and is not questioned
by other brownies.
The seed from a brownie tree that grows for ﬁve
seasons will spawn a brownie of its own.

Fairies seem overwhelmingly female from the
human viewpoint. This is because the male fairy
tends to shy away from any contact while the
females are insatiably curious and meddlesome.
They’re most commonly found in gardens, especially
ones that are rarely tended and have many different
plants in them.
They appear wearing shimmering long gowns
that ﬂow in the slightest breeze. They look totally
humanlike, with the exception that they are only
three to 10 centimeters in height. They have wings
like their Brownie cousins but also have been known
to appear without them.
Fairies have the ability, for short periods to change
their appearance, such as hiding their wings or

becoming human sized. They can maintain human
size no longer than 30 minutes a day, and when
they appear without wings, they can't ﬂy without
casting a spell.
The leprechauns are the most mischievous and
potentially destructive ofthe fairies. They’re also the
most sought after by humanity because their magic
deals with money and alcohol.
The leprechaun is the

largest of the fairies, being
. up to three—quarters of a
‘ meter tall. They appear to be
chubby humanoids dressed
in bright green clothes and
, carrying a walking stick.
L They always have a smile

on their faces and a slight
lilt in their voice.
They’re only found on
_ lonely roads and at the end
of the rainbow. By their
nature, they’re solitary
creatures, rarely
of their kind in their 100—

year lifespan.
The leprechaun springs
forth from a rainbow that’s

not claimed by an existing
leprechaun. This is a rare
event since leprechauns

_' without rainbows are quick to leap on a new rainbow
so theycan retain their magic. This keeps leprechauns
as a nearly level number throughout time.
Water nymphs appear as beautiful human females
: with long flowing hair, usually green, blue, or brown.
The keydifferences are their lower bodies; fresh—water
nymphs have lower bodies of mermaids while salt—
:3 water nymphs have the lower torso of a seahorse.
in their natural form, the nymph averages a half
a meter in length from head to tail and wears no
~. clothing, using only her hair for modesty, if she
l: desires any at all. They can transform for up to a
:- quarter of an hour a day into human female form,
which is covered in a short gown of same color as

; the nymphs hair.
Those who have seen them and survived have

told tales of their incredible beauty. They also tell
anyone who will listen never to look them in the
eyes or listen to their song or all will be lost.
Nymphs come together in small colonies, usually
j associated with a magical water location. In fresh
: water, this is mostly quiet coves ofsmooth lakes and

Pixies hide from human contact until they are
about to be discovered, and then they burst forthin

If caught and not harmed, the fey folk will often 7

exchange their freedom for a single wish. These

There are no clauses or reservations. Wishing for ,

Monster. Though Dr. Frankenstein
is credited as the father of “mad” or
“weird” science, thestudy ofreanimat—
ing lifeless ﬂesh, an untold number of
people have experimented in the ﬁeld
for centuries. Frankenstein simply had
the good fortune to be the most success—
ful to date and to have been recorded
for posterity by literature. This said, his
discovery was monumental and most
work after the mid—nineteenth century
was based on his ﬁndings.
The basis of the creation of a flesh
construct is founded upon remarkable
surgical skill, fresh parts, and luck. Often
having to use bodies that will not be
easily missed, the mad scientist gener—
ally must be resigned to corpses with
several bad organs and gaping wounds.
He combines parts from other cadavers
to build the primary body. This requires
great planning, precise surgery, and excellent storage facilities. (The laboratory of
the mad scientist is often very chilly and
dry to discourage decomposition.)
The primary frame is often heavier than
the original and requires insertion ofmetal
rods. These increase structural integrity

These may include magic, spiritual pOSv
session, radiation, and cosmic energies.

The type of energy used often produces
differences in temperament and strength
of the construct. For instance, constructs
reanimated with magic are generally more
stable and intelligent, but they can suffer
from anti—magic ﬁelds and spells. Typically,
the standard ﬂesh construct - a large,
reconstructed human body -— makes an
excellent thug and manual laborer, but
little else.

As long as there have been folks with
free time and streets where they could
roam, there have been street gangs. Traditionally, gangs are groups of hard—living
' individuals united by some common bond
.. or theme. This bond may seem trivial to
outsiders -—- such as living on the same
street, belonging to the same church, or
working at the same profession - but for
those heavily into the gangs it can be an
all—important distinction. Although they
a

pledge loyalty.
As the name implies, gangs generally
differ from organized crime by their lack

oforganization and long—term goals. However, even this distinction can crumble as

‘ gangs become larger and more ambitious,
and local authorities fail to see the distinction with large enough gangs. In Fact, most
powerful cartels started out as “gangs.”
Gangs have existed since the United
States’ founding, begin—

in close proximity more than at any time
in the nation’s past. For many of these
downtrodden groups, joining forces with
others ofsimilar backgrounds was the only
way to ensure survival.
Although many believe gangs are inher—
ently violent or wicked, this isn’t always
true. Gangs sometimes form as a defensive
maneuver, ensuring the safety of its mem~
bets from other gangs. It’s even possible
for gangs to serve good purposes, acting
as surrogate police and community sup-

port; law enforcement sparsely patrol poor
sections of many cities, so membership in
a gang helps supply protection and - if
necessary «— retribution. Ofcourse, in the
middle of a huge brawl involving dozens
or even hundreds of participants, most
police don’t really care about who started
it or the motivations behind it.
Although street gangs rose to prevalence
in the cities, they ﬁrst captured the public imagination in the Wild West. Here,
bands of desperadoes rode together on
horseback, robbing stagecoaches, banks,
and saloons. The Reno Gang expanded
this repertoire in 1866 with the ﬁrst train

robbery. MostWestern gang members were I
skilled in horse riding and shooting, and «their presence added to the overall image
of the “lawless” frontier.

Other Wild West gangs dedicated
themselves to more altruistic purposes.
For example, Missouri “Shelters” banded

together in 1845 to supplement the efforts
oflocal lawenforcement in thwartingcattle M ,, ,
and horse rustlers. When these vigilantes
encountered those they believed were
responsible for the crimes, they “slicked”
their behinds with hickory withes. 'Iheir
humiliating technique, though ludicrous,
proved highly effective in reducing crime.
While vigilante gangs were illegal —-— and,
indeed, manyused the excuse ofvigilantism
to pull offtheir own crimes -— the citizenry
still loved them.
After the West was brought kicking
and screaming into the twentieth century,
the country found itself dealing with
Prohibition. The lack of legal alcohol did

little to stem the tide of gang activity, as
the general rise in lawbrealting gave these
nonorganized criminals an excuse to act as
ruthlessly as their organized counterparts.

Gargantuan spiders seem to come in

experimentation to create the next great

three varieties, separated by the coloration
ofthe pattern on theirthorax and abdomen.
Blue—patterned spiders are the least violent,
preferring to make their lairs in forests and
caverns near places where cattle and other
large animals graze for food. Yellow-pat—
terned spiders are known to actively hunt
their prey, tracking it into populated areas.
Yellow spiders put up a good ﬁght but tend
to retreat to safety after being wounded.
Red-patterned spiders are cunning and
cruel. Known for hiding in sewer systems
abandoned buildings, these creatures
have a taste for human ﬂesh and are not

developed below the Earth’s crust, gaining
access to the surface due to a recent min—
ing operation, while others say they are
God’s retribution against the unfaithful.
No matter the source of the infestation,
nothing is more fearsome than a truck—size

gargantuan spider, especiallywhen its hairy
legs are standing right above you.
Towing over two meters tall, these dark,
hairy creatures with their segmented legs
travel across stone or other hard surfaces,

while their razor sharp fangs leave a trail

webbing to aid their move—

Miscellaneous

Ghosts
Those who investigate paranormal
phenomena have long understood the link
between ghosts and souls of the living. The
smartest researchers understand there are
potentially as many types of ghosts as there
are souls. Nevertheless, scholars ofthe para-

normal classily most miscellaneous ghosts
into several broad classes. Some theorize that

these classes ofghosts follow an “evolution—
ary” progression, ranging from least to most

advanced. Although the amount ofpsychic
energy a spirit possesses is a partial indication
of its strength, it’s not all~eneompassing; in

much the same way that a giant amoeba can
be a large but basic life form, so too can a
ghost be powerful but unevolved.

At the lowest rung of the ladder, spirit
energy begins to coalesce from the afterlife
and make itself known in this world. This
energy, known as ectoplasm or ghostly mist,
resembles a luminescent thick fog or cloud

and may contain chaotic swirls. Ectoplasm

shape, however, resembles little more than a

This makes the reactions oftheir ships and

The Grays are a xenophobic race, wish«

ing to avoid conﬂict and contact with large
groups. They have shunned parts of space
that are heavily populated and instead
have expanded into the spiral arm that

contains Earth.
Most of the contact that humans have
with Grays is between two speciﬁc seg~

Frontier Grays) and the Inga KaLa (or

Gravy Alien/y
Commonly called Grays by humans,
their name for themselves is the KaLa. They
are between 1.3 meters and 1.67 meters

tall and thin by human standards, weigh—
ing between 26 and 45, yet sturdily built.
Their hairless skin varies from a light gray
or grayish green to charcoal gray.
The Grays have oversized heads that are
dominated by two large, wide—set, black
eyes. They have no discernible ears or nose.
The core or scientiﬁc KaLas have a more
rounded head and eyes, while their cousins
the frontier KaLas have a more enlongated
head and eyes. Most non—KaLas wouldn’t
notice much of a difference.
The large black eyes are set so that the
Grays can 270 degrees around. in addition,
the iris is huge to allow them to see in all
but total darkness as if it were daylight.
However, they are vulnerable to sudden
ﬂashes oflight, which blinds and disorients
them. Their eyes can see into the ultraviolet
spectrum, but they lack a great deal on color
distinction beyond light and dark.
The Gray’s hand has three opposing
ﬁngers, each of which is an active electriv

Gray aliens are very technology depen—

the ability to cause machines of all sorts to cease to

Headless Eaton/w
r

The Headless Horseman of legend is
one a type of spectral creatures that seek
to regain in death what it had lost or been
denied in life, in the case of the Headless
Horseman, that is, a new head. Other,
similar entities may seek a hand, a heart,
or even something immaterial such as love
or respect. Universally, these entities are
driven to commit terrible acts in order to
achieve their goals.
Headless entities are bound to various
rules regarding where they can or cannot
be and when they can appear. They are
always conﬁned to a limited area, which
can be as small as a single estate or as large
as a small country. They must follow a set
schedule ofappearance, though it may not
be immediately apparent. Some examples
include: under the full moon, every midnight, on nights when a cold wind blows
in from the North, the week following the

form ofattack, usually the same thing that

i
The headless entity uses its amazing {3

mobility to disorient and confuse its target f?
before moving in to harvest whatever it
seeks. When the headless entity manifests
its speed, it creates a spectral horse to ride
(from where it gets its name); some more
modern entities ofthis type manifest motor—
cycles, cars, or even planes. The “mount” x
vanishes into mist and fog as soon as the
entity dismounts.

The Augue, a type of hive-mind alien,
are very large, standing between 2.5 and
three meters in height when fully erect.
A They weigh between 150 and 250 kilo,
,. grams and are immensely strong. They

can turn their torsos a full 75 degrees in
‘ either direction, allowing them to respond
to attacks from any angle.
Their legs are powerful but thin. Their
' arms are thick and strong, with six long,
thin ﬁngers on each hand, four ofwhich are
opposable. Their heads, which are hairless,

I 2' are about 50 percent larger than a human’s
skull andhave two distinguishable eyes, two
nose slits, and a mouth. Their ears consist of

H six small openings running from eye orbit
- to eye orbit. Their skin varies from dark
green to jet black; the darker the skin, the

‘ older the creature. They usually wear thin

silver or gray jumpsuits that covers them
from the neck to the knees.
The Augue are an aggressive, expansiom

istic race with a clan—based matriarchy.
Their queen alone produces the royal
offspring, since her egg sack contains both
male and female reproductive organs. The
royal offspring control all the day-to—day
activities ofthe ship, as the queen is almost

never seen and has no contact with nonv
royal Augue. Warriors defend the hive
and are the primary means of subduing
planets. The warrior is fanatical and will
not retreat or surrender. The workers are
tasked with doing a speciﬁc job, and they
do it no matter the circumstances. They
don’t know how to ﬁght, simply ignor—
ing any abuse to them as they attempt to
complete their jobs.
The royals come in three sexes: male,

females, and queens, though the females
are sterile. The warriors and the workers
are all cloned and sexless.
Once aqueen offspring reaches maturity
and has produced her ﬁrst royal oiispring,
“the Swarming” happens, in which a hive
ship and its minimum compliment of
warriors and workers are created for the
new queen and her royalty.
After a scout has gone into a system and
returns with its report, the Augue enter
with a huge hive ship that contains up to
several million royals, warriors, andworkers
and one queen. They swarm onto planets
and strip them of raw materials, leaving
behind dead, ravaged worlds. They have

no patience for diplomacy no matter what
is offered, and they leave no survivors in
their wake.
The royalty can operate without the
hives mind for up to a few days. Warriors
have limited intelligence and, except for

The great advantage ofthe Augue is the
interconnectivity of their minds, which
all feed into a central matrix controlled
by the queen. The queen and royals can
search out speciﬁc details, while the queen
decides what information is sent out to the
warriors and workers.

Horses have been bred, domesticated,
and used by people for over ﬁve millennia.
Serving in warfare, farming, and transport,

no other creature has been more versatile
or vital to humanity’s survival. Although
technology has supplanted many of its
functions, horses still have the power to

inspire awe in a way few creatures do.
The modern era for the horse also
coincides with its decline from usage. The
Industrial Revolution brought with it all
manner ofnew technology. At ﬁrst, equines
existed alongside the new advances; horses
and horse-drawn carriages served as trans—
port to and from new-fangled railroads,
and the muscular creatures also worked as
the power source for the earliest factories.
Up until very recently, the horse was one
of the most common means of personal
transportation; in 1900, there were 100,000
horses in NewYork City alone. In the Wild
West the horse symbolized the power, majesty, and freedom ofthis new land, existing
as transport between rough—and-tumble
pioneer cities and as mounted units. The
Pony Express, which began as a publicity
stunt in 1860 and lasted only 19 months,
enabled mounted postal carriers to carry

and ofﬁcial functions. Many military and
government functions still use horses for
special occasions, where the creatures’ regal

status impresses crowds.

ers to any police call. They have evolved over
the decades from the "tough love” kind of
law enforcement to the modern part social
worker, part investigator.

Beat cops are easily identiﬁed as they
wear a speciﬁc uniform and a badge. Most
carry guns, and all carry some form ofbaton
and handcuffs. Most modern—day cops also
wear a Kevlar vest under their clothes for
lifesaving protection.
They are considered the bottom of the
rung in law enforcement as all new rookies
start offas beat cops and work their way up

the ranks of the police force. They patrol
certain areas (or beats), and they can operate
alone or in pairs.
With the increasing sophistication of
crime in the 18005, there arose a new brand
of police oihcial: the detective (or inspec—
tor). Detective are police ofﬁcers with some
years of experience. Their position on the
force allows them to devote their time to
investigating a few crimes. They usually

They tie together all the witness interviews,
interrogations, forensic work, autopsy
results (if any), and outside information

to present to the prosecutors for court.
While prior to the 19605 their tactics may
have been brutal at times, they proved to

be effective in c105ing their cases. Now they
tend to use more psychological tactics to
gain information from suspects and people
of interest.
With the advances in forensic science
came the crime scene investigator. At first,

they were simply there to dust for ﬁnger—
prints and collect obvious clues under the
direct control of the detective in charge.
In more recent years, they have taken over
running the investigations at the crime
scene, and they supply the detectives with
all the information that they find, from the
obvious evidence to fibers, hair, and DNA.
The CSI, however, is still responsible for
delivering testimony on what the evidence
they gathered means.

The C81 is always dressed in dark coveralls
and a jacket, if needed, with C81 emblazoned on the back. They also carry a large
case containing their tools and, sometimes,
a camera. They usually work in groups of
two or more, but they may operate alone
depending upon the size of the force and

the crime being investigated.
These individuals are skilled at lifting
fingerprints, ﬁnding, retrieving, and analyz—
ing blood, ﬁber, hair, and DNA samples.
They can compare minute striations on
bullets, tools, and cut or torn objects to
determine where they came from or if they
match with another clue.
One of the oldest law enforcement
officials is the sheriff. They and their depu—
ties are charged with policing large areas,
usually counties in the United States and
Great Britain. Over time, the position has
gone from one of a political appointee to
that of being elected.
The sheriff is usually accompanied by
at least one deputy, who’s the county’s
equivalent of the city’s beat cop. In most
jurisdictions, deputies ride alone but cover
for each other when time allows.
Sheriffs often dress in suits with wear
jackets to conceal the service revolver that
they carry. in other cases, they wear a uni—
form similar to that of the deputies, which

includes a light brown shirt, dark
brown trousers, black pistol belt
and holster, six—pointed star badge
prominently displayed on the shirt
or matching coat, and a wide, dark
brown felt hat.
Marshals are specialized federal
agents who are charged with appre—

Leeches are parasitic creatures that are

among the simplest animals in existence.
They are invertebrates with no higher cog—

nitive functions, and they operate on the
% basest of instincts: feed and reproduce.
The common leech is a tiny invertebrate
I with limitedsensoryorgans; theycan detect
light intensity, vibration, and temperature,
all ofwhich help guide them in their quesr
i for prey. There are three distinct varieties
dilterentiated by feeding methods: jawed,
proboscis, and consumption. Leeches with
distinct jaws and teeth use their more
advanced mouth structure to bite a host
and cause bleeding. These creatures secrete
a chemical that prevents blood clots from
forming, ensuring a steady food source.
Leeches thatpossess a proboscis feed much
like mosquitoes, inserting their proboscis
into the skin and draining the blood from
the veins beneath. These creatures have a
similar chemical they secrete to dissolve any
blood clots that form. The ﬁnal kind are
slightlylarger and gain sustenance through
swallowing their prey and digesting it.
These creatures are still very small and feed
primarily on smaller invertebrates.
There are much larger versions oftypical
leeches in existence, although thankfully
these nightmarish creatures are rare. They
can be created through exposure to certain
’ 1' chemicals or radiation wavelengths. This

is occasionally done on purpose, but more
frequently through industrial accidents or
illicit toxic waste disposal. There have been

incidents of these creatures being created
’ through unknown, possibly natural means,
but these occurrences are exceptionally
rare. Giant leeches typically resemble their
. smaller brethren in every way except scale,
‘ although they are obviously more mobile

. and have been observed to be considerably
more aggressive.

Another type of leech exists, although
. they are far less understood than the more
2 mundane versions described above. Over

;

the course of the past century, there have
been a handful of incidents documented
wherein perfectlyhealthy, everyday people
have fallen prey to strange creatures that
can only be described as “psychic leeches.”
These creatures, which paranormal experts
have thus far failed to classify, look almost
identical to normal leeches, though slightly
larger. Psychic leeches do not seem to be
intelligent; rather, they feed on the mental
and possibly spiritual energies generated
by a normal person. The victim slowly
grows weaker and more subdued, with
diminished cognitive faculties, until they
die. These psychic leeches appear to be
considerably hardier than normal leeches,
with an extraordinaryresistance to physical
damage and environmental changes.
Their origin remains unknown, although
theories abound. Some believe they are

Natural Abilities: attach (on a successful

braiding attack, the leech attaches itself
to its target; forcibly removing a leech

Note: Giant leeches have 3D in Physique,

they are an artiﬁcially created life form
intended for use as a military weapon.
Still others attribute them to evolution
or even mystical rituals, a theory that has

its roors in ancient African myths about
summoned demons that drain the life from
one’s enemies. Whatever the truth, the
dangers these creatures represent cannot
be overstated.

Megalomania is a psychopathic condition that’s
predominated by infantile delusions of wealth,
power, or omnipotence. Individuals stricken with
this malady of the mind are often obsessed with
grandiose actions or extravagant things. People such
as these feel they deserve the best life has to offer.
Thus, their hidden hideouts have all the creature
comforts money can buy and are protected by cut—
ting edge, often ridiculously lethal weaponry, while
stunning companions attend to their needs. The
villains make excellent leaders for secret societies,
cabals, and organizations that demand fanatical
loyalty from their followers.
Adversaries of this nature can launch drawn«
out schemes. Unlike merely evil or greedy villains,
megalomaniacs long to prove their superiority and
maypause the implementation ofworlddomination
plans to toywith important captives. Dangerous ptis~

oners are typically forced to endure a long—winded
monologue while their captor boasts oftheir world
conquest plans: Their audience will soon be dead
anyway, and corpses tell no tales. Besides, a quick
demise would mean little and do nothing to prove
j: why the villain is destined to rule the world!
The ensuing tirade can prove useful: Captives may
be able to shrug offthe effects ofbeing drugged, gain
time to loosen their bonds, or accidentally receive
information needed to escape an impending death
trap. In many ways, the megalornaniac’s ego is their
own worst enemy because personality ﬂaws of this
nature are often a great boon to those who attempt
to thwart their schemes.
”
The very nature of megalomaniacs makes staples
for espionage games. Modern settings Featuring these
villains can utilize a myriad of locals as the advent
of the internet allows world domination attempts
to be spawned from nearly anywhere. Wild West
games might feature smaller scale events such as a
land baron who is angered by heroes whose med—
dling is blocking attempts to add land acquisitions
to her empire.
Someone who feels the heroes have slighted them
could turn into a megalomaniacal villain. Such a
person would be bent on getting revenge from those
who have wronged them!
Some megalomaniacal villains prefer to discard
their foes rather than go through the trouble ofslay—
ing them; it makes their victory more sweet to think
that the heroes will live forever with a humiliating

j MW Ghosts
What goes unsaid could ﬁll a hundred
tomes in most people’s lives. Even messages
of grave importance remain unspoken,

ﬂickering away with a last breath. This is
even more true in the world of the restless
dead, where spirits have passed on with

words left unexpressed.
Some ghosts cling to the incorporeal
afterlife because their life or death was

in some way tied to a message or communication. Perhaps the spirit died with
an important piece of information, or
perhaps in life the person was responsible
for giving messages (such as a spy, courier,

or reporter). Other messenger ghosts began
life as another type ofspirit, and they now
reafl'irm their unliving existence byﬁnding
a purpose in delivering messages.
Although more advanced than many

spirits, messenger ghosts are still only
loosely tied to the physical world. Most
of the time, they are insubstantial and

invisible, although through great effort
they can become part of the real world for
briefperiods. Primarily they do so to deliver
their messages. Parapsychologists speculate

that it takes a lot ofenergy to manifest, but
successfully doing so reafﬁrms the ghost’s
existence and gives it more essence; thus
the cycle of unlife continues.
if a messenger ghost chooses to mani—
fest physically, it generally appears as an
indistinct form ofthe person it was in life;
gender is determinable, but only the most
obvious physical characteristics -- such as
missing limbs - become apparent. Usually, though, the entity chooses to remain
‘ invisible, becoming corporeal only to
fulﬁll its duty.

The most important aspecr of a mes—

More advanced messenger ghosts spread
messages via complex means, such as writ—
ing in the dust ofan undisturbed bookshelf
or rearranging word—game tiles to make
simple sentences. 'lhese messages are often
tied to a speciﬁc purpose or intent (such as
“FIND MY DAUGHTER’S KILLER” or
“SOON IT AWAKENS”), although some
messengers are potent enough in spirit to

carryon simple conversations. Forexample,
one spirit is tied to an old subway terminal
in a major city; it is aware of many of its
secrets, and communicates them by tearing
headline words from discarded newspapers
or writing letters on exposed skin. The most
advanced messengers can even become
tied to an individual, sewing as a general
guardian (albeit one limited to spying and
relaying information).

Messenger ghosts are universally mute;
at best they can manipulate noise enough
for a lowwailing or other incomprehensible
tones. Weaker messengers usually disperse
when they successfully resolve their situ~
ation (such as ﬁnding the murderer of a

spirit’s daughter); stronger ones can exist
almost indeﬁnitely. Although vulnerable to
any attacks that affect ghosts, messengers’
greatest weakness is being deprived ofeither
an audience or a means of conveying its
meaning.

Mysterious Lake/Dwellers
In an era where an oft-jaded population
demands instant information, many people
have little time for something as whimsical
as myths. Cynics dissect legends under the
microscope and imagination is often slightly
out ofstyle. Fortunately, for those who still
fascinated by mystery, there are a few things
that defy explanation and some creatures
who have managed to avoid the paparazzi.
Mysterious lake dwellers have managed to
steer clear of attempts to capture or tame
them. The fortunate mystery hunters can
peer past the mist shroudedwaters ofremote
lochs and catch a fleeting glimpse of these
fabulous creatures. Some say these beasts
are born of ﬁction and lies. Others swear
they are living, breathing things.
Monster hunters, scientists, and tabloid
journalists have their own theories about the
origins of mysterious lake dwellers. Many
feel these beasts are gigantic water serpents
or prehistoric marine reptiles. As ofiate, the

the same species.
Mysterious lake dwellers can provide
interesting diversions. The heroes could

reward for positive proof of the existence
of such a creature. Explorers might ﬁnd
an underwater passage that leads to a
prehistoric world. These creatures might
be in dire need of champions as they try
to evade trophy hunters. The beasts might
even know long forgotten secrets.

coelacanth’s extinction reports proved to be

the plesiosaur, have also survived?
The plesiosaur lived during the Mesozoic

The shadows are incorporeal spirits and
are dangerously radioactive. They hate all
life and seek to destroy any living creature
that approaches them. The touch of a
nuclear shadow inflicts terrible burns—— and
possibly a lingering radiation sickness that
will kill her in a matter of days.
Any character who is killed by damage
inﬂicted by a nuclear shadow or dies from
the radiation sickness inﬂicted by one will
become a nuclear shadow after death. The
character’s body explodes with nuclear
flames until only the blasted silhouette of
a nuclear shadow remains.
Physical attacks have no effect on these
creatures. They can be affected by magic,
miracles, and psionics. They are considered

enemies by any mythos that has the concept
of evil spirits.

The poltergeist (German for “noisy

spirit”) is one of the more advanced types
of ghost; spirit—hunters theorize that they
are often the result ofmass accumulations
of psychokinetic energy, brought about
by great mental or physical trauma in
this world or the next. As such, they can

spontaneously generate from this energy
and aren’t necessarily linked to departed
souls, although they can be, if an indi—

vidual has died in a particularly horriﬁc
or violent way.

Although an oversimpliﬁcation, it’s
generally true that, while most ghosts are
, seen and not heard, poltergeists are heard
but not seen. Almost always invisible, poltergeists are able to channel their ghostly
,. energy into powerful telekinetic effects,
moving objects around with great precision

and control. These manifestations can be
as subtle as a slamming bedroom door or
as dramatic as a tempest of plates, cutlery,
and furniture in a dining room.
Poltergeists generally attach themselves
to a location, although it can be a rather
large one (such as “anywhere on Baron
_. Jobe’s ZO—acre estate”). They are similar to
messenger ghosts in that they are usually
tied to their home by a traumatic event or

for a speciﬁc purpose. However, poltergeists
do not use their powers to deliver messages,
instead existing solely to cause havoc and
mayhem.
Some poltergeists are relatively harmless, using their powers for pranks; they
often have an impish sense of humor,
tossing eggs, snapping posteriors with
" towels, or creating elaborately balanced
arrangements of books, playing cards, or

—- typically fear. As such, it’s usually against
their interests to kill their victims at least
immediately. Poltergeists have enormous
patience, and they can toy with victims for
weeks or months. There are tales of some
individuals and families held as virtual
prisoners in their homes, not knowing
what horrors the night might bring.
Although the most powerful poltergeists
have the energy to pick up and toss victims
directly, they usually refrain for doing so;
ghost-Chasers theorize that the spirits real—
ize they can generate stronger reactions by

acting more discreetly. Regardless ofhow
poltergeists react, however, they always
do so noisily. They are those things that
go bump in the night and they can

i’rbn/Ltt’we Tiff/her
Even today, some parts of the world
remain unseen (or at least little seen) by

“modern” people. These areas, far from
the lights and sounds of civilization, have
adhered to a way oflife that other societies
have abandoned centuries or even millen—
nia ago. While car—driving denizens of the
concretejungle might scolfat these humans

that time forgot, so, too, might theseprimi—

“

tives shake their heads sadly at how much
we’ve gotten wrong. Assuming, ofcourse,
that they ever learn about us.
The world got smaller at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, when the age of
exploration and colonization began fully.
At that time, dozens ofpreviously unknown
civilizations of people came into contact
with European explorers mostwith tragic
results. As these “new” lands were settled
(this newness a surprise to the indigenous
people who’d lived there for generations),
fewer and fewer of these people remained
untouched.
In the past century orso, primitive tribes
are most likely to be discovered in areas
that humanity hasn’t yet fully explored or
exploited. These areas include theAmazon,
the heart of the African jungle, and vari-

’ ous dense islands throughout the world.
If planes or boats can’t access the area eas—
ily, and there’s no incentive for difﬁcult
'" or costly land excursions to get there, it’s
possible that secluded tribes could still be
out there.
How interactions would play out with

secluded primitives would depend both on
the tribe and those who discover them; a
hostile band of tomb—robbers might meet
a bloody end, while a party ofcautious and
courteous explorers and anthropologists
might establish long and lasting relations
.. . or they might not. Most primitive tribes
that have remained hidden have done so
" because they are xenophobic; their fear and
. mistrust ofstrangers causes them to remain
hidden away from any signs of humanity.
While it’s possible for some tribes never to
. have come in any contact with the outside
world, within the last century or so, most
will have seen strange shiny birds high
overhead and heard the chewing of metal

monsters on the outskirts oftheir territory.
And, when confronted with this evidence,
most ofthe remaining undiscovered tribes
stay hidden.
Primitive tribes are usuallyhunter~gath—
erers; if so, they either have permanent

dwellings and large hunting areas, or else
they are nomadic, with their gathering
“domain” limited to the immediate area
around their temporary shelters. Ifa tribe
has advanced beyond hunting-gathering
to agriculture, their homes are even more

permanent.
Most primitive tribes lack a written
language, with their oral history and tradi~
tion passed down from one generation to
the next (usually by mystics and priests,
but sometimes by the entire community).
However, it’s possible for a primitive tribe

to have a language, either pictographic or
a full alphabet. Ifso, their language might
be an offshoot or decedent of a “lost”
language, or otherwise provide valuable
scholarship for cultural anthropologists;
for example, ﬁnding a tribe still speaking
a relatively pure descendant of Babylo—
nian in the middle ofAfrica would pose
quite a conundrum and may result in
the rewriting of history books.
In most primitive cultures, the stron—
gest warrior usually becomes the leader,
although occasionally the wisest shaman
is in command. How this person gains

leadership reveals much about the society;
one tribe might settle its needs via ritual~
ized combat, another might use a voting
mechanism with politicking and scheming,
and still another might choose its leader
from descendants of a royal family.
Some might mistakenly believe that
primitive tribes are, at best, curiosities ofa
bygone era and, at worst, obstacles to deal
with along the way of “proper” exploring.
While this might be true in some circum—
stances, these lost tribes may have much to
CECE Their knowledge ofthe area they call
home is unsurpassed. In fact, this lore can

stretch back generations; primitive tribes
might have knowledge ofhidden temples,
long—lost treasures (magical or otherwise),
or even elusive ﬁnds such as the “fountain

ofyouth.” Ofcourse, getting these people
to reveal their secrets can be an immense
challenge; they would probably ﬁght to
the death to avoid giving particularly useful information, and adventurers seeking
this knowledge by peaceful means would
almost certainly need to perform heroic
deeds to win their trust.
In a ﬁght, individual members of
primitive tribes would not be able to mount
much defense against combatants with
modern armaments. However, they have

two advantages that tip the odds closer
to their favor. First, the primitives are
probably used to working and ﬁghting as
a close—knit community; if they turn their
ire against a single explorer or a small party,
their numbers and teamwork could make
quick work of them. Second, the native
tribes have a near-encyclopedic knowledge
of the region; this “home ﬁeld advantage”
provides signiﬁcant beneﬁts for them.

Investigators tend to use deception, fast

the 18305 but were only available to the
rich, soon to be rich, corporations, and
governments. They are brilliant people

talking, and general razzle-dazzle to get

their homes.
With their brilliance comes many quirks,
such as a great love of ﬁne food, a conde—
scending nature, or being very shy around
the opposite sex. They tend to spend most
of their days shut away in their studies,
libraries, workshops, and laboratories. They
are always well dressed, even at home, unless
for some reason they have to personally
undertake an active investigation. They
are very moody as a rule and can become
manic without warning when their mind
has latched onto a key fact of the case.

Sleuths are a combination of investiga—
tor, intimidator, and problem solver. They

made private investigations affordable to the
masses. Theyare generally loners, sometimes

working in an ofﬁce with another sleuth but
rarely working with anyone else, including
the police. Most are ex-police ofﬁcers and
have a love hate relationship with the police,

having both friends and enemies on the
force. Theyare nor above taking on an active
police case, and they will do anything in
their power ~—~ whether it means following
the law or bending it until it breaks —-— to
solve their clients’ problems.

or overcoat, to conceal their weapon, lock»

The investigator tends to dress so that
they can easily blend into the current situa-

tion. They are not above donning disguises
and clothes to attempt to slip into areas
they could not get into normally.
With the advent of modern electronics
and the Internet comes the introduction ofa

new kind ofprivate investigator: the snoop.
Rather than gaining information via direct
confrontation, they use electronic means.
They are as comfortable with bugs, cameras,
and Internet hacking as an investigator is
with pulling a scam to gain information.
The snoop comes in all shapes and sizes,

They refrain from using lists or a gun

of an assault charge can be hazardous to

they tend to be off by themselves doing
their job and supplying the rest with the

information gained.
The one potentially dangerous part ofthe
snoops’ job is when they have to go into a

Most snoops don’t like this part oftheiriob,

Publicity seekers are those who try to

These folks can be broken down into two
types —— general and limited ~—— and three
broad methodologies: knowers, doers, and

General glory hounds are those who

while limited publicity seekers are those

scientists, explorers, scholars, and the

publicity seekers, since it’s the hardest path
to take and generally the least successful;
while there are many people who become
famous by discovering the unknown, most
people only interested in fame don’t take
this uncertain route.

might even resort to violence or worse to

A

; smmum
One ofthe true horrors of reality is that
~ evil does not have to wear a monstrous

mask to be effective. It often chooses to
walk the earth in an average—looking,
nonthreatening form that easily blends
into the background. Serial killers are
urban predators who utilize circumstance
and the indifference of the world around
them to stalk victims. These sadistic ﬁends
come from all walks oflife. ’Iheir prey rarely
suspects their true intentions until it’s far
too late. On some occasions, serial killers

make benign contact with their quarry. The
good Samaritan who stops to fix your tire
today might stalk you tomorrow!
Serial killers usually fall into one of
”

several archetypes.

Visionaries typically embrace insanity
or have psychotic tendencies. They com—

“"" monly hear voices in their head that urge
them to commit violent acts. Animals or

inanimate objects could also give these
” commands. This allows visionaries to com«

mit heinous acts but remain blameless in
their own eyes. Visions sometimes arrive

through dreams.
Mission-oriented serial killers often

appear to be quite normal to the outside
“ world. Their inner thoughts however, tell

quite a different story. These killers tend to
stalk a select group of victims. Common
targets are prostitutes, young women,

a children or people of a different race.
Mission’oriented serial killers feel they
have been selected to rid the world oftheir
chosen victims. Some consider themselves
to be an instrument of God.
Others take the lives of innocents for
the emotional rush it gives them. These
villains are usually the most sadistic oftheir
kind and feed off their victim’s fear. Thrill
killers differ from visionaries and mission—
oriented killers because they often choose
to take lives indiscriminately. People who
are quick to express their emotions are

preferred targets since they can be worked
to a higher level offear. They derive pleasure
from killing and often torture victims in
hope ofprolonging their agony. Nothing is
beyond their capability to commit heinous

acts. Many strive to make each new kill
more diabolical than the last.
Lust also drives demented souls. One
might ﬁnd them romancing several
potential targets only to slaughter them
once their trust had been gained.
On rare occasion, some serial killers
say the devil possessed them. Such
claims are impossible to prove, as physi—
cal evidence is difficult to come by.
Thus far, Lord ofLies has not appeared
in court to confess his crimes.
Serial killers have plagued humanity since the late 17005 when the
Harp boys slashed their way into

history. Micajah (Big) Harp and
Wiley (Little) Harp were cousins

who became Tory outlaws when
theAmerican Revolution disrupted
their plans to oversee slaves in
Virginia. in 1798, they brutally
slew men, women, and children
while drifting across the young
nation. Their victims were

often disposed of in lakes after
disemboweling them and ﬁlling
the corpses with rocks to make
them sink faster. Their reign of
terror ended when Big Harp
was captured and decapitated.
His head was mounted on an
oak tree to serve as a warning
for ne’ervdo-well who might
wish to pass through town.
§ome accounts tell ofLittle Harp meeting
the same fate years later, but he may have
escapedjustice. lt’s estimated that the Harps
viscously murdered at least 30 people.

lack the Ripper is perhaps the most
famous serial killer of all time. He preyed
on prostitutes in a crime~ridden district of
London and baffled the local police who
seemed helpless to stop him. The murderer
gained his nickname from letters sent to
torment the authorities. In spite ofmassive
efforts to capture the Ripper, he wandered
off into the London Fog and his crimes
remain unsolved to this very day. Many
books, movies, and articles attempt to
peer past the veil but Jack’s true identity
remains a mystery.

Albert Desalvo appeared to have a dual
personality. He adored his family and

seemed completely unaware of the crimes ,
he confessed to as the Boston Strangler.

The depraved soul claimed victims from ‘
1962 to 1965. His attorney, F. Lee Bailey,
would ironically be the one to conﬁrm that
Desalvo was the Strangler after testing his
client with questions only the murderer
would know. The strangler was never
prosecuted for any of the 13 murders he
was suspected to have committed due to
Bailey’s intervention, but Desalvo did serve
a life sentence for brutalizing awoman. The
Strangler was stabbed to death in 1973 at
Walpole State Prison.

The aftermath ofthe French Revolution

Napoleon in his bid for Empire. The mass

scouts.) Technological advances begin—

almost universal adoption of conscription
by the continental European states, a tradi—

tion that is only now beginning to end in
favor ofprofessional, allovolunteer militar—
ies. The United Kingdom, ever apart, has
a tradition ofa small professional military,
though they did use conscription in both
World Wars (and after the Second World

War into the 1950s).
Until the turn of the twentieth Century
most uniforms worn by European armies

were colorful affairs designed to show loyalty
to the nation and to foster camaraderie and
bravery (the French entered the First World

Warwith an infantry uniform that included
red pants for exactly that reason —-— thinking
that the uniform would inspire bold action).
The realization ofthe increased accuracy of
riﬂe ﬁre slowlyled to the universal adoption
of dull colored (khaki, horizon blue, or

ﬁeld gray) uniforms that allowed a soldier
to blend into the battleﬁeld.
The interwar period (1919—1939) was a
time of a return to colonial matters (both

England and France had acquired new

colonies from the Germans and League
of Nations mandates from the former
Ottoman Empire). It was also a time of
tight budgets and experimentation with
new technologies. Tanks and mechanized
combat was tried but abandoned as too
costly as the Western European powers
(England and France primarily) prepared
to ﬁght the First World War all over again,

but better this time. The Maginor Line (a
series of concrete bunkers that stretched
along France’s northern border) was an

expression of this mindset.
The Second World War saw a move
toward mechanized combat (which only
accelerated in the European nations after—
ward). The German blitzkrieg (“lightning
war”) tactics changed the rules of warfare

but the Germans were never able to mechaw
nize more than a small fraction of their
army (most of the German army relied

upon animalodrawn transport). The incred—
ible amount of US. industrial production
allowed the American and British armies

ning in the 1960s saw the development of
(relatively) lightweight body armor lead—

ing to its widespread adoption by most
European armies who are very mindful
of the protection of their citizen-soldiers.
Since the end of the Soviet Union, most
European countries have scaled back their
military spending and many are considering
abandoning their traditional conscription
system for an all-volunteer military.
The tactics used by European armies
have often lagged behind the technological
changes on the battleﬁeld. The Napoleonic
era was an era of linear combat; due to the
inaccuracy of smoothbore muskets troops
had to be massed and fire in unison at other
masses of troops to have a chance to inﬂict
casualties. The longvloading time between
shots and short range ofthe weapons made
charges by bayonet using troops a successful
tactic, and battles were often decided on
the point of a bayonet.
Between the end ofthe Napoleonic Wars
and the beginning of the First World War,
tactics for the European battleﬁeld did not
change much. There were very few Euro~
pean wars and most European troops who

lower technology base.

The widespread adoption ofthe military
riﬂe allowed infantry to target and hit
enemies at much longer range; this slowly
lead to the end of massed infantry tactics.
Nonetheless, the tactical lessons of the
American Civil War (1861—1865) and the
Russo—Japanese War ( l 9044 905) were not

fully understood and accepted in Europe
until the First World War. The dangers
(some would say suicidal) of mass attacks

against riﬂe-armed infantry and machine

guns led to the stalemate of trench warfare
on the Western Front.

The Second World Warsaw the return to
a war ofmaneuver with the mechanization
of the battleﬁeld. There was a wider use of
armored vehicles in combat and a greater
reliance on vehicle to move troops and
supplies. Paratroops were ﬁrst used in the
Second World War, and close air support
became common. The Germans pioneered

the blitzkrieg usinga mechanized—spearhead
supported by tactical air support to drive
through the enemy lines and cut the enemy
into pockets that could be mopped up by
the slower moving infantry.
After the Second World War, European

armies continued to become increasingly
mechanized and technology oriented to
counter the military system of the Sovietarmed Warsaw Pact forces. Tactics were

They are mostlyled by political appointees,
who have little practical military knowledge and a great (sometimes foolhardy)

desire to make a name for themselves.
The newly raised units elect their ofﬁcers
from among their ranks, usually a man
with some education. These were leaders
who the men trusted and who, in turn,
would try to see that the men were not
killed needlessly.
In 1861, when the states take sides,
the state militias go with them. Large
numbers ofvolunteer units are raised,
and the Union soon uses conscription
to add even more men to the ranks.

War. Many ofthe ofﬁcers are holdovers from
the Civil War, so their uniforms remain the
same as well. However, now all troops are

issued riﬂes, in some cases repeating rifles.
The percentage of cavalry increases dra~

controlled lands to patrol. Cavalrymen are
equipped with carbines and pistols, but the

sabers soon disappeared as theyare expected
to ﬁght on four in most cases, rather than

eyes have a yellowish cast to them, and their
ﬁnger nails are long and clawlike. They
appear in groups, the number of which is
always a multiple of three or ﬁve.
Tauntors are cruel, petty, and mean.

deserted areas, and then slowly torture them
to death. They are accomplished mimics

these skills to cause ﬁghts among others.
A favorite way ofluring people is to taunt
their victim into chasing after them. The
chase ends in a prepared area.
Tauntors are cowards and will rarely
attack unless they outnumber their foes
by at least three to one. The exception to

VampEre/y
When one mentions of vampires, Brae
ham Stoker’s Dracukz often comes to mind.

As time passed, the genre has grown as
other authors have developed the vampire’s
nocturnal world, added myths oftheir mali—
cious nature. This has caused great angst
for the undead who stalk the world’s streets
because they would prefer such things to
be left in the past as it would make their
existence much easier.
Like many legendarycreatures, vampiric
lore reflects the deeds ofonlya small portion
oftheir population. A few oftheir kind were
indeed ravenous fiends who ran with wild
abandon across the midnight countryside
to feast off any warm neck that could be
found. After all, the undead lords had near

limitless power and were immortal. Why
should they fear their human cattle? The
world was theirs for the takingl Fortunately

frozen, and no where to turn.
Somewhere between the ﬁnancialwizards
and slaves of ego lie monsters that only
exist to feed. They prey upon the nameless
fringes ofsociety by targeting the homeless
or others who would not readily be missed.
Unlike their more aiiluent brethren, they are
forced to relyon witandcircumstance. Their
typical lairs include catacombs, forgotten
sewer tunnels, and mined buildings. Hunt~
ing these creatures can be quite difﬁcult
due to their ability to blend in with their
surroundings. What one might think to
be a vampire could merely be an addict or
other denizen that hails from the dregs of
humanity. The predators also do their best
to covertly discourage drug pushers from
entering their domain. After all, whywould
they want to their next meal tainted?
Vampires could be the major antagonist
or serve as crucial cogs that drive the gears
oflarger plans. Theirs is the ability to draw
upon vast cultural experiences gained from
their extended lifespan. Western settings
might feature an apparent alcoholic gun~
slinger who shuns the daylight hours while

clearer heads and dodged the wrath of
mortals. It’s these survivors and their
spawn that now threaten the modern
world.
A wide variety ofvampires populate
the planet. There are those who gladly
walk among the masses. Such creatures
risk everything to feed their vanity and
use a high profile lifestyle to throw
off suspicion. What would normally
raise eyebrows is merely written off as
eccentricity. Thus, they skate the edge
of discovery, which only feeds their
emotional rush.
Socialite vampires usually surround
themselves with an entourage. After

can travel with you! They may keep
several groups ofwilling sheep for this
purpose and take great pains to ensure
the marks of their feedings go unno—
ticed. Artists, rock stars, supermodels,
and (to be cliche) Goth personalities

are apt ﬁts for this type of vainglorious creature.
Socialite vampires often nearly
flaunt their undead status. 'lhese crea—
tures may try to encourage preposter—
ous rumors of their vampiric nature
and treat such things as an inside joke.
After all, everyone knows there are no

such things as vampires.
At the other end of the spectrum
lies subtle, calculating creatures that are not
nearlyso foolish. These vampires have with—
drawn to the shadowy depths ofcivilization
and prefer to avoid unnecessary attention.
It’s no accident that they have avoided the
vampire hunter’s stake. Secret Swiss bank
accounts, subterfuge, and layers ofmystery
are the common tools of their trade. The
ancient creatures of the night have cloaked
their true origins in mystery and slowly
built their power as the years slid by. The
acquired might allows the parasites greater
ease in feeding ofrr humanity. if one finds
them at all, they might see these lords of
the night manipulating a small nation from
behind the scenes or directingvast ﬁnancial
empires. Vampires ofthis ilk are accustomed
to wielding vast power and prefer to solve
their problems with maneuvering insread
ofresorting to needless violence. Their connecrions allow them to do more than merely
crush their foes. Those foolish enough to
earn their anger may ﬁnd themselves left

sleeping off hangovers.
Heroes may incur the wrath of undead
masters after unwittingly disrupting their
ﬁnancial manipulation plans. They could
spend some time traveling through a web

ofmystery before ﬁnally cutting the puppet
master’s strings.

backs and sides are typically gray but their
underbellies are usually white. According

of land—based mammals. They have been
known to entertain strangers with their
oceanic acrobatics.
Porpoises are similar in size to dolphins
but have striking differences. They do not
have a bealdike face, and their dorsal fin is
triangular in shape instead ofcurved. These
creatures are rarely seen in large groups and
are not performers; larger cetaceans and
ships appear to frighten them.

Whales often travel in social groups called
pods. The ﬁrst sign of a whale’s presence is
usually the blow created by water expelling
from the blowhole. They might also leap
above the ocean’s surface and return to the
depths with a mighty splash. This breach
communicates their presence to others. One
might see the head of a whale surface until

Dolphins, porpoises, and whales have
intrigued humanity for centuries and
belong to the cetacean order, which is
divided into three primary groups.
The toothed whales (odontoceti) use

their teeth to catch food. Odontoceti
have one blowhole (nostril) and hunt by

echolocation. Dolphins, porpoises, and 64
other species fall under this classiﬁcation.

Toothed whales frequently hunt, travel,
and migrate together.
Baleen whales (mysticeti) feed on small

sea creatures by ﬁltering them though a
comhlike structure called a baleen, and
they have two blowholes. They may seek
the company of their kin but can also be
found traveling alone. Ten species make up
the mysticeti group.
The archaeoceti are whales that are pre'
sumed to be extinct. This group includes
the primitive basilosaurus, which was the
ﬁrst known eocene whale.

Dolphins dwell in the world’s temperate
and tropical waters and may migrate to fol»

nose dolphin can reach 2 .7 meters in length
and weigh 260 kilograms. These intelligent

itself. Angered whales have been known to
slap their rail or extend it. Such creatures
should be given a wide berth due to their
destructive power.
When undersea, whales navigate by
sound. Their songs have mystiﬁed those
who study these noble creatures.
Blue whales are the largest animal to ever
exist. They can reach 33 meters in length,
weigh 108 metric tons, and can live for 50
years. These creatures are an endangered
species and protected by the International
Whaling Commission.
The basilosaurus lived nearly 40 million
years ago during the middle Eocene period
and resembled sea serpents more than
modern day whales. Full—grown specimens
were nearly 32 meters long, and their heads
could reach two meters in length. The
basilosaurus’ jaws were outﬁtted with two
different kinds of teeth. The cone—shaped
teeth near the front held on to the prey it
captured and triangular-shaped teeth near
the rear were used to chop up food.

Through years ofstudy and practice, some people
have learned to harness the powers of the universe
that are outside of normal human perception.
The mostsecretive and devotedwizards are always
thin to the point of being almost skeleton—like by
the end of their life. The primary reason is that the
magic they practice sucks huge amount ofenergy out
of them. Thus, no matter how much they eat and
drink, their bodies are being constantly consumed
by the magic. Furthermore, the Wizard’s pupil and
iris ofthe eye turns completely black. Many wizards

_' use cosmetic contact lenses to cover this fact.

Wizards and even their journeymen never go any

oftheir mentor wizard. A breach ofetiquette about
the use ofmagic can have the student expelled from
the society. While apprentices andjourneymen only

know their speciﬁc mentor, the society feels the
revealing of its presence to be a deadly affair.

Wizards live a celibare lifestyle, ”never marrying
or having outside relationships that would distract
from their studies. This is one of the major reasons
that most apprentices leave the brotherhood.
All apprentices, upon entering the brotherhood
for training have a spell cast upon them: Should
they break the vow of secrecy they will die a hor—
rible death. This keeps even the dropouts and those
rejected for advancement from speaking openly
about their experiences and knowledge.
Apprentices have no usable magical ability but
they have the innate ability to feel the magic’s power.
This draws them to the society and keeps them
going through the long years of training. While
they are learning the rudimentary basics, they are
mostly used to fulﬁll theWizard’s needs. Journeymen
have the ability to harness some magic; they work
on putting together and learning their spellbooks.
