<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Genetic
manipulation becomes possible at PL 5 when technology advances enough
to create electron microscopes, computer-aided imagery, and the tools
to delicately examine and manipulate the tiniest building block s of
life—genes. At this point, scientists are able to experiment with
DNA, gene splicing, and other activities that eventually lead to more
advanced techniques.</font></font></p>

EXPERIMENTS</font></font></h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Science
is not a process that happens quickly, although key developments
often happen accidentally, reshaping the knowledge base overnight.
Performing basic experiments in genetic manipulation realistically
would take a researcher months (and more likely years) of effort.
However, once the scientific groundwork is laid, tests and procedures
can be attempted more rapidly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">In
general, testing any single hypothesis about a procedure, or
discovering the effects of performing a specific genetic
modification, requires 3d10 days and a successful Research check. The
DC for this check should be no lower than 20 and can be as high as
the GM prefers. Scientific research is painstaking and even
experiments based on solid theories must often be attempted several
times before providing a conclusive result.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">If
the GM is running a more cinematic campaign where scientists develop
theories and produce solutions in quick succession, she may opt to
change the time required to 3d10 hours and the Research DC to a
minimum of 15.</font></font></p>

DISEASES</font></font></h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">One
of the most basic implementations of genetic manipulation is
modifying existing microscopic organisms such as bacteria and
viruses. At PL 5, scientists are able to alter existing diseases to
be resistant to particular medicines and resilient enough to survive
in conditions that would kill their naturally occurring relatives.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">At
a later stage of PL 5, researchers learn to splice together the DNA
of two or more different diseases to create super viruses. At this
point, they can tailor such characteristics as the disease’s
incubation period and primary, secondary, and tertiary symptoms. They
can even make it resistant to all known treatments and, at the same
time, create a wholly effective remedy—putting them in the position
of being able to infect the entire world and only providing the cure
to those they deem worthy.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">The
flip side of this, naturally, is that scientists are able to create
synthetic medicines—antibiotics and other drugs—that combat
diseases that were previously uncontrollable. Unfortunately, nature
is at least as inventive and resourceful as science. Whenever a new
cure is developed, it is not long before scientists discover one or
more diseases that have natural immunity to it.</font></font></p>

is possible in the closing stages of PL 5 for scientists to develop
effective forms of gene therapy. These treatments can be used on
mature creatures to replace defective genes, or genes that are linked
to particular diseases, with a more benign gene. Usually this is done
using modified retroviruses (viruses that can create DNA copies of
their own RNA), however, several other methods exist, all of which
are capable of targeting specific cells—lung or liver cells, for
example—within a living organism. No gene therapy regimens are
approved for use on humans in the U.S., but scientists are currently
working toward that end.</span></font></font></p>

SCREENING</font></font></h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Using
advanced PL 5 techniques, it is possible for scientists to learn a
great deal about an organism even while it is gestating. By taking a
sample of a developing creature’s DNA, they can tell what physical
and mental qualities it is liable to possess, what diseases or
conditions it is predisposed toward, and even what its emotional
temperament is likely to be.</font></font></p>

IF IT ESCAPES?</font></font></h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Specimens
for use in laboratory experiments are generally bred to be
short-lived, require specific temperatures and conditions to thrive,
and often are sterilized. If a sample escapes or is accidentally
released, it is nearly impossible for it to survive outside the
laboratory, and even more unlikely that it would be able to
reproduce. A virus that has a life cycle of 12 hours and can only
live in a pH3 solution of 30% saline between 60°F and 70°F is
extremely unlikely to survive long enough in the wild to affect
anyone or anything.</font></font></p>

early in PL 6, scientists discover ways to not only replace abnormal

therapy, the ability remains latent, so the patient receives no
benefits from the intended manipulation. Immediately upon completing
the required number of Fortitude saves, the ability activates and
becomes a permanent special quality of the patient. Alternatively,
there may be treatments with short-term durations. (According to most
scientific authorities, these are not realistically feasible, but
they can be found in many places in fiction.) A short-term treatment
automatically takes effect in 1d4 minutes and lasts for 1d3 hours. At
the end of that time, the character reverts to his normal state, is
fatigued, and suffers 4 points of Constitution damage. A successful
Fortitude saving throw (DC 15) reduces this to only 2 points of
Constitution damage.</font></font></p>

main idea to remember is that according to our best understanding of
genetics, each gene tends to affect only a single trait (or a small
set of closely linked traits). At PL 6 it is only possible to modify
one gene at a time. To create more drastic changes, the patient must
undergo several gene therapy treatments, each one requiring a

type of genetic engineering found in many futuristic settings is
cloning. A sample of one creature’s DNA is used to make an exact

original creature in every genetic way—blood type, birth defects,
fingerprints, and retinal pattern. However, the clone does not have
any scars, tattoos, or other identifying marks gained during the
course of the original creature’s life. If, for example, the
original creature was born with only one kidney, the clone has only
one kidney. However, if the original creature has had a kidney
removed, any clone made of him will have two kidneys (as the original
creature did at birth).</font></font></p>

is a very difficult process. Although the number of successful
experiments has increased, creating and bringing a clone to full term
is a high-risk endeavor and scientists generally have to make several
attempts before an experiment reaches a satisfactory conclusion. Any
single attempt to create a clone has roughly a 90% chance of failure.
What’s more, clones tend to be prone to a host of developmental
problems including accelerated decrepitude, unexplained organ
failure, immune system failure, and a generally weak constitution.</font></font></p>

time toward the end of PL 5 or the beginning of PL 6, researchers
find the solution for the developmental problems to which clones are
prone. At this point, it is possible for scientists to successfully
clone any living organism with an acceptably low failure ratio. (In
most cases, a ratio equal to or lower than the general infant
mortality rate is sufficient.)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Each
clone, though, must still go through the same gestation period and
developmental processes as a child conceived through ordinary
procreation. In fact, without a detailed genetic examination, it is
difficult (if not impossible) to tell the difference between a
naturally conceived baby and a clone.</font></font></p>

the clone is given the same nutritional and physical environment the
original person had, he develops physically in exactly the same way
as the original person. The two may be completely different in terms
of personality and temperament, much the same way as any parent and
offspring. The clone may be a physical recreation of a person, but it
is not an emotional or intellectual duplicate.</font></font></p>

good deal of debate centers around potential medical uses for this

the scientific community is allowed to work through the technical
problems of viability and the moral issues surrounding the creation

possible for them to use cloning technology to grow specific organs

cells in the lab so that they spontaneously develop into a liver,
lung, or kidney. This eliminates the need for organ donation and make

advent of cloning allows scientists to create genetically identical

year or two of a person’s life, such a significant age difference
exists between the original person and the clone that they are more
akin to parent and offspring than to identical siblings. The next
quantum leap in cloning technology comes when scientists develop the
ability to artificially age the clone. Rather than wait for the
embryo to age normally, this advance allows the clone to mature at an
accelerated rate until it is an exact replica of the donor (minus
scars, tattoos, and other acquired physical modifications).</font></font></p>

the same advanced rate even after the fetus becomes a viable infant.

voraciously sought, onco-guard attacks and contains cancerous cells.
Additionally, onco-guard prevents a character from developing cancer
while the nanites remain in the bloodstream, either in their active
or inert states. A character injected with onco-guard recovers from
any negative effects of cancer almost immediately and is immune to
further developments of the disease for 2d6 months.</span></font></font></p>

outward in random directions. In addition to causing internal
bleeding, resilite tears through vital organs and damages bones and

nanoaugmenter that gives the brain increased memory capacity. The
nanites in brain boost latch onto the memory and thought centers of
the brain and transmit data back and forth between these centers at
an incredible rate. Each nanite can store large amounts of data and
acts as a temporary memory storage center. Brain boost nanites also
move back and forth between various memory centers, copying and

chatter resembles the technology of the micro-aural communicator.
However, unlike the microcom, the nanites in a chatter nanocolony
attach directly to the speech and language centers of the brain. When
a character wishes to communicate via his chatter nanites, he needs
only to think of what he would say and the nanocolony transmits those
thoughts over a communications channel. When other nanites receive
the communication, they transmit the information directly into the

Prophecy nanocolonies link to a computer system that receives images

locations to computer representations of terrain. Like chatter,
prophecy is often used on soldiers in the field to transmit dynamic

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">The
ability to create any object from seeming nothingness is a common
theme in science fiction. Known as matter replication, the process is
the computerized creation of an object where no such object existed
before. Essentially, matter replication allows for an object to be
willed into existence through the application of technology.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Matter
replication is not discovered until PL 7 and typically is not
perfected until PL 8, when manipulation on the atomic level becomes
truly practical. Matter replication is an incredibly precise process
that requires not only detailed blueprints for an object (down to the
molecular level) but also the ability to recreate that object in some
fashion.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Matter
replication is usually accomplished by machines known simply as
replicators. A replicator device combines powerful computers that
store massive amounts of blueprints for various objects. These
computers have a catalogue of millions of objects and a detailed plan
for replicating each one. Specialized replicators only replicate
certain objects within a category, such as food or weapons,
eliminating the need for too diverse a catalogue (which takes up
massive amounts of memory storage). Once the blueprint for the
desired object is located, the replicator triggers whatever
recreation mechanism is in place (see below) and produces it within a
matter of minutes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Matter
replication usually raises issues that fundamentally change a
society. With matter replication, hunger is almost instantaneously
eliminated since foods can be reproduced instantaneously without the
time and effort of planting, tending, and harvesting. The laws of
supply and demand sometimes cease to apply since any object in a
replicator’s catalogue can be duplicated as many times over as
desired. Occasionally, all concepts of personal wealth vanish because
anyone can have any object he or she desires simply by replicating
it. Some governments restrict the use of replicators to prevent
malcontents and rebels from arming themselves with replicated
weapons, and some societies keep a tight rein on all replicators to
prevent abuse. These are a few of the issues raised by the advent of
matter replication, but are among the most significant.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Obtaining
a replicator is easy in some civilizations and difficult in others.
Societies that have abandoned the concept of wealth accumulation
might make replicators easily available, while societies that tightly
monitor replicator technology may not make them available to the
public at all. Depending on the setting, replicators may be either
abundant and cheap or rare and expensive. The GM determines what role
matter replication takes in a society and how readily replicators can

k nown as alchemy. Replicators that rely on alchemy as their primary
means of producing new objects transform one element into another to

mass as the desired object. This type of replication relies heavily

building blocks of matter. This form of replication is one of the

Protomatter is a generic base from which all other matter is
replicated; it can be transformed and molded as the replicator’s

prevent counterfeiting and other deception, some replicators have
built-in mechanisms for marking objects they create. One such
